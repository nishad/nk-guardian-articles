    "content": "Donald Trump has said he is considering some \u201cvery severe things\u201d in response to North Korea\u2019s successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) this week, as he called on other nations to exert pressure on Pyongyang over its \u201cvery bad behaviour\u201d. Trump said the US would confront the North Korean threat, but noted that he would not draw a red line. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about what I have planned, but I have some pretty severe things that we\u2019re thinking about,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to do them.\u201d The president\u2019s comments, made in Poland, came after the US ambassador to the UN made a push for new sanctions at a security council meeting and said America\u2019s \u201cconsiderable military forces\u201d could be used against North Korea. Nikki Haley told the meeting the US would submit a draft resolution within days \u201cthat raises the international response in a way that is proportionate to North Korea\u2019s escalation\u201d, but warned Washington had options if diplomacy failed. \u201cThe United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies,\u201d Haley told the United Nations security council on Wednesday. \u201cOne of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them, if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction.\u201d She said the US was eyeing penalties against \u201cany country that does business with this outlaw regime\u201d. On Thursday Russia blocked a security council statement condemning the launch, because it disputed the description of the rocket as an intercontinental ballistic missile and said the weapon may have been a medium-range missile. Haley retorted that the UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, the United States and North Korea all described the weapon as an ICBM, adding that if Russia needed intelligence to prove it, \u201cI\u2019m happy to provide it.\u201d South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae In, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, moved to head off any immediate American military response when they met in Hamburg ahead of the G20 summit. After a 75-minute meeting, the two leaders emphasised the need for the G20 to show a united response to the crisis, and described North Korea\u2019s test-launch as \u201cunforgivable\u201d and agreed to impose tougher sanctions on Pyongyang. But in meetings with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, Moon warned against a military response, saying: \u201cAmid high tensions like this a single accident could bring about a dangerous situation. So both increasing the pressure and managing the situation are required.\u201d The Chinese finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, said Beijing would implement all sanctions agreed by the UN, but urged the US not to use its domestic laws to find a backdoor route to imposing sanctions on Chinese financial institutions. Moon, a liberal recently elected on a ticket backing dialogue with the North said in a speech in Berlin \u201cnow is the last chance, and also the best, for North Korea to make the right choice\u201d. He presented his five-point policy towards the North, including a commitment to peace, and a \u201cdenuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in a way that guarantees the security of the North Korean regime.\u201d He also offered humanitarian aid to the North Korean people and meetings between family members who have been separated since the Korean war. He said: \u201cWe do not wish for the collapse of North Korea and we will not pursue any form of unification by absorbing the other. We will not pursue unification by force.\u201d Trump is scheduled to meet Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, where he will travel from Poland later on Thursday. Trump and Vladimir Putin are also expected to address growing North Korean provocations at their meeting on Friday. China has already called for restraint from all sides, after joining diplomatic forces with Russia to suggest that North Korea suspend its missile programme in return for a moratorium on large-scale US and South Korean military exercises. China is pushing for talks between world powers and North Korea on dismantling its nuclear programme but the US maintains that Pyongyang must first halt its missile and nuclear tests. Theresa May also condemned North Korea\u2019s actions and called for China to exert more pressure on its neighbour. The UK prime minister, who will have the opportunity to raise the issue with Xi on Friday evening at the G20 summit, added that Britain would support sanctions on Pyongyang. \u201cWhat I think needs to happen is first of all we absolutely condemn the action that North Korea has taken. What we need to see is a China who can exercise influence on North Korea playing a greater role in doing that,\u201d May told reporters as her plane landed in Germany on Thursday. \u201cIf there are proposals to tighten sanctions and extend sanctions we will do that.\u201d Kim delivered his own message on Wednesday, with the state Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) quoting him as saying: \u201cAmerican bastards would be not very happy with this gift sent on the July 4 anniversary.\u201d The news agency claimed the North Korean missile was capable of carrying a \u201clarge, heavy nuclear warhead\u201d that could survive re-entry into the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Kim was quoted as saying the North\u2019s long confrontation with Washington had entered the \u201cfinal stage\u201d and that Pyongyang would not put its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles up for negotiation \u201cunless the US hostile policy and nuclear threats come to an end completely\u201d. A report in its state media said Kim urged his scientists to \u201cfrequently send big and small \u2018gift packages\u2019 to the Yankees\u201d. Questions remain about whether the North can miniaturise a nuclear weapon to fit a missile nosecone, or if it has mastered the technology needed for it to survive re-entry into the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Some experts believe the North already has the ability to mount warheads on shorter-range missiles that can strike South Korea and Japan, home to dozens of US military bases and about 80,000 US troops.
