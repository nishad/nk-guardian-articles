    "content": "After North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test on Sunday, Donald Trump once again responded by putting pressure on Beijing. \u201cNorth Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China,\u201d Donald Trump tweeted that morning, \u201cwhich is trying to help but with little success.\u201d In a subsequent tweet, Trump threatened to stop all trade with countries that do business with North Korea \u2013 which includes most of the world\u2019s large countries, but targets China, through which North Korea conducts roughly 90% of its trade. \u201cWe\u2019ll work with China,\u201d Steve Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, said on Sunday, \u201cbut people need to cut off North Korea economically.\u201d The Trump administration must know by now that Beijing will not crush North Korea by halting trade. In early July, Trump seemed to finally realize this: \u201cTrade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cSo much for China working with us \u2013 but we had to give it a try.\u201d Nonetheless, he continues to try. In early August, he convinced Beijing to sign on to a tougher set of sanctions against Pyongyang. In mid-August, he pressed China to \u201cdo a lot more\u201d to rein in North Korea. And yet North Korea continues its provocative weapons tests. Trump seems to have equated Beijing\u2019s refusal to economically strangle North Korea with a refusal to work with the United States on restraining North Korea. By doing so, Trump ignores Beijing\u2019s needs, and increases the likelihood his North Korea strategy will fail. Luckily, Beijing could still be a good partner for the United States in countering Pyongyang\u2019s brinksmanship and aggression. How? By cracking down on North Korea in the ways that benefit both Beijing\u2019s interests and the United States\u2019, and by conducting diplomacy in a way that respects Beijing\u2019s sovereignty. Trump seems to think sanctions will so weaken Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, that he will be forced to negotiate, while China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping seems to believe the opposite: that only by opening up its economy will North Korea evolve into a responsible (or at least, not sullen and truculent) country. There is, however, a small area where Washington and Beijing\u2019s strategic goals overlap: the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The United States doesn\u2019t want Pyongyang to have nuclear weapons, and Beijing dislikes both Pyongyang\u2019s arsenal and the fact that South Korea falls under the United States\u2019 nuclear umbrella. Indeed, after Beijing agreed to sanctions in early August, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said their purpose was to bring the \u201cpeninsula nuclear issue back to the negotiating table, and to seek a final solution to realize the peninsula denuclearization\u201d. Instead of focusing on sanctions in his discussions with Beijing, Trump should frame the North Korea issue around denuclearization \u2013 which is the eventual goal of sanctions for both Washington and Beijing. The second issue is more delicate for Trump, but arguably more important. Beijing resents Trump\u2019s hectoring tone on how to deal with a country that has long been part of its sphere of influence. \u201cNorth Korea is an important piece on Beijing\u2019s diplomatic board,\u201d the historian Sergey Radchenko wrote in the online magazine Chinafile. \u201cBringing Kim to his knees on behalf of the international community does nothing to advance Xi\u2019s vision of a China-centered order in East Asia.\u201d Trump \u2013 to borrow parlance used to mock Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy \u2013 needs to lead from behind. Let Beijing accept praise if North Korea denuclearizes, and censure if it continues to conduct nuclear and missile tests. He must understand that, besides the extremely unlikely event of a war, Beijing has more to lose if North Korea collapses: starving refugees fleeing into the country, a peninsula unified under a pro-American government and the specter of American troops on China\u2019s border, among other consequences. The president should publicly admit that the strategy for containing and constraining North Korea are Xi\u2019s ideas and initiatives instead of Trump\u2019s \u2013 regardless of how the ideas arose. Trump should also shift the narrative so that the focus stays on China\u2019s relationship with North Korea, and not the United States\u2019. As strange as this may seem, Trump has led from behind before with North Korea. In February, while Trump hosted the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Pyongyang launched a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan. The two men held a press conference that evening to respond to the missile test. Trump let Abe speak first, and, surprisingly succinctly, told the assembled press: \u201cI just want everybody to understand and fully know, that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%.\u201d He then sat down. Trump should adapt a similar strategy with regard to China and its relationship with North Korea. Although allowing others to occasionally take credit for one\u2019s ideas is a basic management strategy, Trump may lack the humility and self-assuredness needed to implement it. And yes, China and the United States are not allies, but there are ways for Trump to publicly demonstrate his respect for Chinese interests, in a way that does not make Trump look weak. Beijing won\u2019t help Trump economically strangle North Korea. Living with a nuclear North Korea, or allowing Beijing to drive the situation, is a far better option than risking war.",
