    "content": "You will never see The Interview, at least not legally. I have seen it twice, so, like the renegade bibliophiles from Fahrenheit 451, gather ye round and I will tell you the tale. The Interview is, by and large, a good movie. Is it worth a debilitating corporate hack? No. Worth an international diplomatic earthquake? Certainly not. It is a movie in which the North Korean people are liberated because its supreme leader soils his pants on television. This is not satire on the level of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s The Great Dictator, but if you can brave the demilitarized zone of scatological humour, it is quite funny. And its sympathies are in the right place. The only person who should find the movie offensive is Kim Jong-un. James Franco plays Dave Skylark, an expensive haircut and host of the infotainment programme Skylark Tonight, best known for the \u201cMiley Cyrus camel-toe\u201d incident. We meet him in the middle of a great \u201cget\u201d \u2013 Eminem confesses to being gay, stating that his lyrics thus far have been \u201ca trail of gay breadcrumbs\u201d. Many critics have been puzzled by much of Franco\u2019s output. It\u2019s hard to tell whether he\u2019s a good actor, but he is a great overactor. Celebrating in the booth is Seth Rogen\u2019s Aaron Rapoport, Skylark\u2019s producer for a decade who is determined to start producing real news. According to Wikipedia, Kim Jong-un is a huge fan of Skylark\u2019s show. Rapoport \u2013 eventually \u2013\u2013 books an interview, and that\u2019s when the CIA recruits them to \u201ctake him out\u201d. The rest of the film plays out with a stoner\u2019s stream-of-consciousness logic. There is a goofy training montage set to David Bowie\u2019s I\u2019m Afraid Of Americans. One minute our duo is walking in slow-motion to Isaac Hayes like total badasses, the next an errant sneeze nearly kills the pair of them. No one watching The Interview could interpret it as legitimate sabre-rattling. Our lead characters are idiots and the scenario is preposterous. Idiotic though it may be, the screenplay doesn\u2019t pussyfoot around \u2013 it chooses a direction and goes with it. Not all the jokes land, and some of the tastelessness may inspire groans. Putting two American dinguses in North Korea is rich source material for racial stereotyping, but the jokes are, by and large, self-aware; the laughs at the expense of the dumb racist. One must tip the hat to Rogen for finding a way to craft a \u201cme so solly\u201d joke that isn\u2019t offensive. The big twist comes when they meet Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. Randall Park plays the supreme leader as a nervous super-fan, a clever choice that puts the whole movie on its ear. He\u2019s quite sweet and he and Skylark quickly bond. They share thoughts about their demanding fathers and there\u2019s a party montage that mirrors an earlier one between Skylark and Rapoport. No way Skylark is going to kill his new best buddy! But a brief look at the man\u2019s more bloodthirsty side, as well as discussions with other North Koreans who hate his brutal regime, persuade them to proceed as planned. In this, the movie has its cake and eats it. It condemns US intervention, and mines its heroes\u2019 ineptitude for laughs, but still climaxes with Kim blown up in a helicopter. The last few scenes use violence for shock gags, but Kim\u2019s death is sort of in self-defence. He is the first one to fire a shot. Yet assassination isn\u2019t our heroes\u2019 key victory. This was to win the hearts and minds of the North Korean people through the power of infotainment. They trip Kim up while on television, exposing him as mortal. They must make him cry. Getting him to soil himself only cements the deal. One of the myths told about Kim is that he has no need to excrete because he \u201cworks so hard he burns it off\u201d. Proof of the man\u2019s digestive tract is a political act. It works in a film where the largest setpiece involves Rogen needing to hide an enormous metal device inside his rectum. This sequence is a symphony of sphincter humour. Chaplin had floating globe ballet. The Interview has lines like: \u201cThe tiger\u2019s blood will lubricate it\u201d. How exactly is difficult to explain. Maybe some things should stay in the vault.",
