    "content": "A dark shadow is looming over the world after more than half a century of peace, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has said after North Korea\u2019s sixth nuclear test. Xi made no direct reference to Sunday morning\u2019s detonation as he addressed an annual summit of the Brics nations but told his audience that only through dialogue, consultation and negotiation could \u201cthe flame of war be put out\u201d. \u201cThanks to the joint effort of all countries, global peace has reigned for more than half a century. However, incessant conflicts in some parts of the world and hotspot issues are posing challenges to world peace,\u201d Xi said in his 40-minute address to a summit attended by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa in south-east China. \u201cThe intertwined threats of terrorism and a lack of cybersecurity \u2013 among others \u2013 have cast a dark shadow over the world. People around the world want peace and cooperation, not conflict or confrontation.\u201d The timing of North Korea\u2019s latest nuclear test represents a major diplomatic embarrassment for Xi, who has been attempting to burnish his credentials as a foreign policy guru ahead of a key Communist party congress next month. Last week, state media televised a six-part homage to Xi\u2019s foreign policy achievements, hailing the \u201cwhirlwind of charisma\u201d he had taken to five continents and 56 different countries since taking power nearly five years ago. Xi had hoped to further boost his image as an international statesman by hosting this week\u2019s Brics summit, an event that has now been upstaged by Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear test. Sunday morning\u2019s test caused a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, which shook towns and villages along eastern sections of China\u2019s 880-mile border with North Korea and sent residents racing out into the streets. \u201cI was having lunch in a restaurant when the lights just started shaking,\u201d Zhang Zhiyuan, a journalist for the Yanji News, who lives and works less than 20 miles from the border, told the Guardian. \u201cPeople here have all run outside of their apartments.\u201d Video footage released by Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, showed light fittings trembling in one home following the test. Hundreds of miles west in Beijing, the political reaction was muted. China\u2019s foreign ministry issued a brief statement, in which it said Beijing \u201cresolutely opposes and strongly condemns\u201d the test. \u201cChina will work with the international community \u2026 to unswervingly push forward the denuclearisation of the peninsula and to unswervingly maintain peace and stability on the peninsula,\u201d added the statement, which was similar to previous Chinese condemnations of North Korean tests. The Global Times, a Communist party-controlled tabloid that sometimes reflects official views, criticised North Korea\u2019s apparently most powerful nuclear test yet as \u201canother wrong choice\u201d from Pyongyang. \u201cThis test will result in a new round of escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and heighten the risk of the situation spiraling out of control due to possible miscalculations by all sides,\u201d it said in an English-language editorial. \u201cIn face of such a complicated situation, China needs a sober mind.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese government should feel angry, unhappy and disappointed,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Beijing\u2019s Renmin University. \u201cThe nuclear test is a slap in the face for China.\u201d Experts say Beijing is wary of placing too much pressure on Pyongyang for fear of causing regime collapse and a calamitous regional crisis that might ultimately bring US troops even closer to Chinese soil. But Cheng said he believed Beijing needed to ratchet up the pressure on Kim while also dispatching a special envoy to Pyongyang for direct talks with its leaders. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for everybody to put their cards on the table. The time for business-as-usual has passed.\u201d Shen Dingli, an international relations expert from Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, said Sunday\u2019s test underlined the futility of both Washington and Beijing\u2019s policies towards North Korea. \u201cNorth Korea is determined to get nuclear weapons [so] whatever sanctions and international opposition there is will fail. China will continue to promote failure through its failing policy of more tests, more sanctions, more sanctions, more tests. China has entered a deadlock. North Korea will get nuclear weapons just like China did in the 1960s ... China is destined to fail. Shen said he also believed it was only a matter of time before Donald Trump realised he had no choice but to sit down with Kim. \u201cHe is a businessman. He is a smart man. Donald Trump will be the first US president to accept North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. John Delury, a North Korea expert from Yonsei University in Seoul, said he believed it was also time for Washington to start direct talks with Pyongyang: \u201cThey are barrelling ahead on their nuclear and missile programmes and we need to find an off-ramp.\u201d Additional reporting by Wang Zhen",
