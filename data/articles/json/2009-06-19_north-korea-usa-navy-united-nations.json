    "content": "Tension was growing in the Pacific today as the US navy prepared to intercept a North Korean cargo ship suspected of carrying weapons in defiance of a United Nations ban. The US navy has been tracking the Kang Nam since its left a North Korean port on Wednesday. It would be the first ship to be intercepted since the UN last week imposed sanctions on North Korea as punishment for conducting an underground nuclear test last month. The sanctions ban the import and export of nuclear material, missiles and all other weapons other than small arms. A USS destroyer, the John McCain (named after the father of the Republican senator, who was an admiral), was awaiting orders to intercept the ship off the Chinese coast. The UN sanctions only allow the US to hail a North Korean ship and demand to be allowed to conduct a search, but not forcibly board it. North Korea has said a forcible search would be regarded as an act of war. Reflecting heightened tension, the US today began moving radar systems and ground-to-air missiles to Hawaii. The Pentagon said it fears that Pyongyang could test-fire an intercontinental missile in the direction of Hawaii over the next few weeks in retaliation for the UN sanctions. US officials designated the Kang Nam as being of \"special interest\" soon after it left port. If the North Koreans refuse to allow a US crew to search the ship, the US could order it into the nearest port. Failing that, the USS John McCain could closely follow the ship until it reaches a port. The US would then be entitled to demand, under the UN sanctions agreement, that that country inspect the ship. Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, told reporters at the Pentagon yesterday: \"Without going into specific details, clearly we intend to vigorously enforce the United Nations security council resolution.\" Republicans, such as the failed presidential candidate John McCain, have criticised the UN resolution for being too weak because it does not make such searches at sea mandatory. McCain on Tuesday described interceptions without mandatory searches as \"a half measure\" and called for a tougher response, \"Those ships should be stopped and searched if there is probable cause,\" he said. But Mullen said the US would first try \"hail and query\" and if that failed, direct the ship to a port where the country would be required to inspect the vessel. He refused to confirm that the Kang Nam was the ship being tracked or to say what the ship might be carrying. Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, sitting alongside Mullen, told reporters he was taking seriously the possibility of a North Korean missile launch in the direction of the US. \"We're obviously watching the situation in the North, with respect to missile launches, very closely. And we do have some concerns, if they were to launch a missile to the east, in the direction of Hawaii,\" Gates said. Japan's Yomiuri newspaper, citing a Japanese defence ministry analysis, said North Korea may fire a long-range missile over Japan towards Hawaii between July. Gates ordered the deployment of anti-ballistic missiles to the islands group. The Theatre High-Altitude Area Defence (Thaad) missiles do not carry warheads but are intended to collide with incoming missiles. He has also directed that an array of floating radars be positioned in the ocean round Hawaii, known as the Sea-based X-band (SBX), whose beams are meant to track incoming missiles. \"So without telegraphing what we will do, I would just say, we are - I think we are - in a good position, should it become necessary to protect American territory,\" Gates said. In contrast with Iran and other foreign policy hotspots where the Obama administration is pursuing a softly-softly approach, it is toughening its position towards North Korea, frustrated that Pyongyang has rebuffed various diplomatic overtures and incentives offered by the Bush administration. Washington wants Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table to discuss the decommissioning of facilities aimed at creating nuclear weapons. North Korea has been responsible for secret nuclear proliferation, including the export of information and material to Libya, which has since voluntarily given up its nuclear weapons ambitions. Defence analysts question whether North Korea has a missile capable of reaching Hawaii or Alaska. Its Taepodong-2 missile in April managed to reach only half the distance required to reach Hawaii. But defence analysts are also sceptical about whether, if the missile was to approach Hawaii, the US is capable of intercepting it.",
