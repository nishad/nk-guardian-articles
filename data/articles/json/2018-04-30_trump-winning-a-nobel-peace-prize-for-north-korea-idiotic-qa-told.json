    "content": "Should Donald Trump win the Nobel peace prize? Though it might have seemed a remote prospect when the US president was tweeting boasts about the size of his nuclear button four months ago, the question has been posed with increasing sincerity since an historic meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea last week. The South Korean president Moon Jae-in said he believes Trump should win the Nobel. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham thinks so too. One can only speculate on whether Trump deems himself worthy of the accolade. So when it came up on Monday night\u2019s politician-free episode of Q&amp;A on the ABC, it was not without context. But the panel \u2013 made up of journalists including Masha Gessen, NBC\u2019s Katy Tur and New York Times critic Wesley Morris \u2013 seemed to think not. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gessen, famously critical of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, summed it up thus: \u201cWell if Trump\u2019s claiming complete success [then] let\u2019s give him the Nobel peace prize. \u201cCome on, he has tweeted insults and now we\u2019re supposed to think that has made an actual policy difference in the world? How idiotic is that conversation,\u201d she said. But what about Trump\u2019s role in bringing about the meeting and its result, a promise for \u201clasting peace\u201d and \u201ccomplete denuclearisation\u201d on the divided peninsula? \u201cHow much is Trump responsible for that? Maybe a little bit, it\u2019s very hard to tell. One of his potentially great qualities is his ability to keep the other side off balance,\u201d journalist and Lowy Institute senior fellow Richard McGregor said. Tur, who covered the Trump campaign in the lead-up to the 2016 election and is in Australia for the Sydney writers\u2019 festival, agreed to be the \u201cidiot of the bunch\u201d by indulging the idea. But she said it was a mistake to ascribe too much motive to the president who \u201coperates in a moment-to-moment basis\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s a little ridiculous to ascribe a madman strategy to him, I don\u2019t think he intended to keep people off balance and that\u2019s his big negotiating tactic,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t say definitively though that whatever he\u2019s done by tweeting about big buttons and calling [North Korean leader Kim Jong-un] little rocket man [wasn\u2019t effective]. \u201cMaybe that worked, I don\u2019t know. I think its too early to tell, even in the best of circumstances. Remember you had Arafat and Rabin on the White House lawn in 1993 shaking hands for an historic peace agreement between the Palestinians and Israel and look what happened after that? There was another intifada.\u201d \u201cThey did get Nobels, though,\u201d host Tony Jones helpfully pointed out. Following comedian Michelle Wolf\u2019s headline-grabbing act at the White House Correspondent\u2019s Dinner, the all-journalist panel was also asked to engage with the question of whether it was the media\u2019s fault that Trump was in the White House. Wolf\u2019s routine included a critique of the media\u2019s relationship with Trump, stating: \u201cHe has helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him\u201d. Gessen, who wrote in the New Yorker that Wolf\u2019s speech was \u201cthe most consequential monologue so far of the Donald Trump era\u201d because it \u201cburst the bubbles of civility and performance\u201d playing out between the press and the president, said the media \u201cdropped the ball\u201d in its coverage of Trump during the campaign by \u201ctreating him as a normal candidate\u201d. \u201cI think the media covered Donald Trump exactly the way the media have covered elections for at least the last several election cycles which is horse race kind of coverage, it\u2019s not about policy, it\u2019s full of false equivalencies and its completely entertainment orientated,\u201d she said. While Tur said that US voters decided they liked Trump \u201cregardless of whether or not he was on cable news\u201d, Morris said the media \u201ccreated\u201d Trump well before he ran for office. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a person in any aspect of American politics this fluent in the television linguistic art,\u201d he said. He said television networks, and by extension its viewers, found Trump \u201cfascinating\u201d because they were so used to seeing conventional politicians \u201coperating in a certain mode of behaviour\u201d. \u201cWe thought it was a joke and then increasingly it became less funny,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s astounding to me is, trying to figure out what to do with all the things we\u2019ve never seen before. I think it just confused everybody.\u201d But Gessen said that Trump \u201csailed to the White House on all the free air time he got\u201d. He got plenty on Monday night.",
