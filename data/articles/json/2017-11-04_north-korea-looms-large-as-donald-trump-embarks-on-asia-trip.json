    "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s five-nation trip to Asia may take him away from his battles with opponents and prosecutors in Washington, but it will inject his volatile, combative personality into the heart of the most dangerous nuclear standoff in the world. The president has broken precedent by clearly and repeatedly threatening to carry out a first strike against North Korea. On the eve of his Sunday departure, he did it again. \u201cWe have one problem. That\u2019s called North Korea,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cI must tell you North Korea\u2019s a thing that I think we will solve and if we don\u2019t solve it, it\u2019s not going to be very pleasant for them. It\u2019s not going to be very pleasant for anybody.\u201d As with previous threats of \u201cfire and fury\u201d, being \u201clocked and loaded\u201d and ready to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea, Trump did not elaborate, but the comments were made in the context of significant escalation on both sides. North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test in September, most probably of a thermonuclear bomb, marking a significant step up in its capabilities. It has tested intercontinental ballistic missiles over the summer. The US has boosted military exercises with its partners and for the first time in a decade, it has three aircraft carriers and their battle groups in the region. The buildup has led to fears across the region that both sides could stumble into war. Pyongyang\u2019s greatest fear is of a \u201cdecapitation strike\u201d that would seek to kill Kim Jong-un and his top leadership before they have the chance to launch either nuclear weapons or a conventional bombardment on Seoul and US bases in the region. There is a belief, widespread among analysts of North Korea, that Kim will choose to go down \u201call guns blazing\u201d, unleashing destruction on the region if he thinks he is under imminent threat. He may even have set up a \u201cdead hand\u201d mechanism, by which an order for a nuclear launch is automatic in the event of his death. Certain elements of recent US-led exercises are likely to deepen North Korean fears. B-1B bombers have flown off the country\u2019s coast, north of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) for the first time since the end of the cold war. And the USS Michigan, a guided missile submarine, docked at the South Korean base at Busan, equipped with special pods on its deck of a type used for Navy Seal mini-submarines. The last time the Michigan came to Busan, six months earlier, the South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted military sources as saying that it was carrying Navy Seals on joint wargames with their South Korean counterparts, to practise operations to \u201cremove the North\u2019s war command\u201d. The US navy did not respond to a request for comment, but it has said in the past that it does not train for decapitation raids. The South Korean government, however, has announced that it hopes to have its own special forces \u201cdecapitation unit\u201d in place by the end of the year. Trump\u2019s 11-day trip is intended to be about much more than North Korea. With stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, it will be the longest visit to the region by a US president since George HW Bush traveled there in 1992. Bush caught flu on that tour, and threw up in the Japanese prime minister\u2019s lap. On this occasion, the greater fear is that the region will have an allergic reaction to the president. There are more than 140 protests planned in Seoul, where the population is anxious that it will be the first to pay for Trump\u2019s outbursts. In a briefing before the trip, the US national security adviser, HR McMaster, made it clear there would be no cooling down of the president\u2019s rhetoric, saying Trump \u201cwill use any language he wants to use\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president really modulates his language. Have you noticed him do that? I mean, he\u2019s been very clear about it,\u201d McMaster said. A presidential visit to the Korean DMZ has been removed from the itinerary because, a White House official said, there is not enough time and such visits have become a cliche. Barring any provocations from Pyongyang, the most critical moment is likely to come on Wednesday when Trump addresses the South Korean assembly at a time of tense relations with the new president, Moon Jae-in. Moon has distanced himself from Trump\u2019s threats against Pyongyang, insisting no military action can be taken without his government\u2019s agreement. Seoul has also been alarmed by Trump\u2019s threats to walk away from the US-Korean trade agreement and to make South Korea pay for US missile defence systems deployed on its soil. \u201cA big question is how Trump will handle the North Korean issue in that speech,\u201d said Mira Rapp-Hooper, an expert on North Korea at the Centre for New American Security. \u201cIf he does or says anything overtly critical, it will put Moon in a very difficult place.\u201d Alongside trade talks, North Korea will also hang over Trump\u2019s meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing. The president has repeatedly argued that China has the unique leverage capable of restraining Pyongyang and avoiding conflict. Rapp-Hooper said it was unlikely the Beijing meeting would bring about a dramatic change in Chinese policy. \u201cUnfortunately I think the bounds on the possible outcomes are between a disappointing nothing-burger and something quite a lot worse,\u201d she said. \u201cChina still has the same fundamental national interests in the Korean peninsula. There may be some specific measures, but China will do nothing that it feels could possibly destabilise the regime.\u201d In Japan, Trump\u2019s first stop, there is general support from Shinzo Abe\u2019s government for his muscular policy toward North Korea, but apprehension about his unpredictability. Michael Green, an Asia expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Abe currently had low opinion ratings for his handling of the North Korea threat \u201cand that largely is because the public\u2019s uncertain where Donald Trump is taking North Korea policy and whether Abe-san is going along for the ride\u201d. \u201cIn fact, I think behind the scenes the Japanese government is asking a lot of questions about the circumstances under which the US might use force.\u201d Special boxes of rice crackers on sale in the Japanese parliament before Trump\u2019s visit have a cartoon of the US president playing cards with Abe and other leaders on the box. The Japanese prime minister\u2019s wife is warning him: \u201cDon\u2019t draw the joker, dear.\u201d",
