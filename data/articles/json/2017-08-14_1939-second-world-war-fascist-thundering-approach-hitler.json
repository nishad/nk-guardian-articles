    "content": "A chill of remembrance has come over me during this August month. It feels as if the 2017 summer breeze is being scattered by the winds of war blowing from across our world towards Britain, just like they were in 1939. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia eviscerates Yemen with the same ferocity as Mussolini did to Ethiopia when I was child in 1935. The hypocrisy of Britain\u2019s government and elite class ensures that innocent blood still flows in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Theresa May\u2019s government insists that peace can only be achieved through the proliferation of weapons of war in conflict zones. Venezuela teeters towards anarchy and foreign intervention while in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte \u2013 protected by his alliance with Britain and the US \u2013 murders the vulnerable for the crime of trying to escape their poverty through drug addiction. Because I am old, now 94, I recognise these omens of doom. Chilling signs are everywhere, perhaps the biggest being that the US allows itself to be led by Donald Trump, a man deficient in honour, wisdom and just simple human kindness. It is as foolish for Americans to believe that their generals will save them from Trump as it was for liberal Germans to believe the military would protect the nation from Hitler\u2019s excesses. Britain also has nothing to be proud of. Since the Iraq war our country has been on a downward decline, as successive governments have eroded democracy and social justice, and savaged the welfare state with austerity, leading us into the cul de sac of Brexit. Like Trump, Brexit cannot be undone by liberal sanctimony \u2013 it can only be altered if the neoliberal economic model is smashed, as if it were a statue of a dictator, by a liberated people. After years of Tory government, Britain is less equipped to change the course of history for the good than we were under Neville Chamberlain, when Nazism was appeased in the 1930s. In fact, no nation in Europe or North America has anything to crow about. Each is rife with inequality, massive corporate tax avoidance \u2013 which is just legitimised corruption \u2013 and a neoliberalism that has eroded societies. Summer should be comforting but it isn\u2019t this year. Looking at the young today, when I watch them in their leisure; I catch a fearful resemblance with the faces of the young from my generation in the summer of 1939. When I am out in town, I listen to their laughter, I watch them enjoying a pint or wooing one another, and I am afraid for them. This August resembles too much that of 1939; the last summer of peace until 1945. Then aged 16 and still wet behind the ears, I\u2019d go to pictures with my mates and we\u2019d laugh at the newsreels of Hitler and other fascist monsters that lived beyond what we thought was our reach. Little did we know in that August 1939, life without peace, without carnage, without air raids, without the blitz, could be measured in days. I did not hear the thundering approach of war, but as an old man I hear it now for my grandchildren\u2019s generation. I hope I am wrong. But I am petrified for them. \u2022 Harry Leslie Smith\u2019s latest book Don\u2019t Let My Past Be Your Future is published by Constable &amp; Robinson on 14 September",
