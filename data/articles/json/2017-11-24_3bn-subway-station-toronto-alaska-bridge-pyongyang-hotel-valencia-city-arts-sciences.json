    "content": "How much should one subway station cost? The city of Toronto has an answer. The plan to extend transit in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough winds back at least a decade: at one time the plan was a seven-stop light-rail line; later a three-stop subway. Today, Scarborough is preparing to replace its six-stop automated train with just one single, solitary subway station, for a mere C$3.35bn (\u00a32bn). Is that a wise investment? Time will tell, but in a recently unearthed 2013 assessment the transport agency Metrolinx calls it \u201cnot a worthwhile use of money\u201d. Many voters in Scarborough feel differently, and Toronto\u2019s mayor, John Tory, has no plans to change course. But if Toronto may be about to purchase the most expensive single subway stop in history, it wouldn\u2019t be alone in sinking good money into bad projects. White elephants are everywhere. America\u2019s \u2018bridge to nowhere\u2019 Back in 2005, Alaska scored a spending coup in Washington, DC. In that year\u2019s mammoth infrastructure bill, the state managed to peel off $223m for a bridge to connect a town of 80,000 people on the mainland to just 50 on Gravina Island. It would have been longer than the Golden Gate bridge, and higher than the Brooklyn bridge. Due to how few people it would reach, it was quickly dubbed \u201cthe bridge to nowhere\u201d. The moniker became a curse following Hurricane Katrina: senator Tom Coburn tried to reallocate some of the money for the Gravina Island bridge to help rebuild New Orleans. When his attempt failed, senator John McCain vocally assailed it as a classic pork-barrel project. Gubernatorial candidate Sarah Palin, meanwhile \u2013 one day to be McCain\u2019s choice for vice president \u2013 supported the bridge, once proudly displaying a T-shirt reading \u201cNowhere, Alaska\u201d. In the end, even Palin decided it was a bad idea. In 2007, as governor, she put the brakes on the project (though, despite what a McCain-Palin 2008 campaign ad claimed, she did not stop it entirely). It was finally scrapped in 2015. South Korea\u2019s Four Major Rivers project In 2009, South Korea launched the Four Major Rivers Restoration project. Its goal was to improve water quality in the Han, Nakdong, Geum, and Yeongsan rivers, and to make parts of South Korea more resistant to floods and drought. The latter part of that plan involved building 16 dams. Cost? 22 trillion won, or about \u00a315bn. For their money, South Koreans do not appear to have received all they were promised by the former government of Lee Myung-bak. Since the project was declared complete in 2011, it has been slammed by the country\u2019s Board of Audit and Inspection: in 2013 it found that \u201cdue to faulty designs, 11 out of 16 dams lack sturdiness, water quality is feared to deteriorate \u2026 and excessive maintenance costs will be required\u201d. Earlier this year, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stepped in \u2013 and ordered yet another audit. Berlin\u2019s airport: coming soon (forever) In 2006, Berlin\u2019s new airport was projected to cost about \u20ac2bn and open in 2012. Five years later, not only has its opening been pushed back to 2019 and its budget ballooned to more than \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.6bn), but so has the number of passengers expected to pass through it. Initially, it was thought that by closing Berlin\u2019s two operating airports, Tegel and Sch\u00f6nefeld, the new Berlin Brandenburg airport (BER for short) would have to handle around 27 million passengers per year. But in 2016 Tegel and Sch\u00f6nefeld saw 33 million passengers combined. The crown on this classic white elephant: Germany\u2019s government currently spends \u20ac16m a month just to maintain the unfinished airport as it is. What happened? A litany of design and construction issues, as well as accusations of corruption. Tests of the fire alarm system revealed so many problems that the corporation in charge of the airport suggested hiring 800 low-paid workers to stand around the airport and send notifications via mobile phone if they smelled smoke or saw a fire. By 2015, when the airport was supposedly two years from opening, 150,000 defects had been found in the airport \u2013 85,000 of them \u201cserious\u201d, according to one official. So much, it has been said, for German engineering prowess. The $51bn town Prior to 2014, Sochi was a sleepy, sub-tropical resort town for well-heeled Russians on the Black Sea. Once it was designated host city for the 2014 Winter Olympics, however, an army of contractors and construction workers descended on the city to build 49 new hotels, 13 new and renovated train stations, five new schools, six medical centres, and 200 miles of road (including 22 new tunnels and 55 new bridges), according to a New York Times report. The cost: an estimated $51bn. By comparison, the 2016 ummer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro \u2013 a much larger event \u2013 are estimated to have cost around $13bn. In 2016, the Olympics site boasted that Sochi was \u201cstill basking in Olympic afterglow\u201d, but other accounts suggest that might only be partly true. Photos published in 2015 showed the Sochi Olympic site abandoned, and the roads and hotels surrounding it empty. However, the private investment that flowed to the city in the run-up to the games \u2013 particularly for new real estate \u2013 has meant that for some, Sochi is now reportedly a retirement mecca. Spain\u2019s crumbling masterpiece Recently, architect Santiago Calatrava\u2019s name has become synonymous with the massive Oculus exoskeleton jutting up in lower Manhattan, adjacent to Ground Zero. But in the late 1990s, Calatrava\u2019s name was linked to an even grander project: Valencia\u2019s City of Arts and Sciences. The anticipated build cost for the original design of the massive complex, which now includes a performance hall, two bridges, a planetarium, an opera house and a science museum, was predicted to be \u20ac300m. But further modifications by the region\u2019s government saw the price more than treble, eventually surpassing \u20ac1bn. The complex has been plagued with problems, most notably involving the roof of the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia opera house: the tiles covering it came off, which Calatrava\u2019s team blames on incorrect application, rather than design. In 2014, Valencia\u2019s government decided to replace the roof entirely, for a further \u20ac3m. That same year, Valencia announced it was suing Calatrava \u2013 who was paid nearly \u20ac100m for his work \u2013 and his architectural firm for the cost of repairs. But legal issues weren\u2019t new to Calatrava. Two years earlier, he had sued a regional leftwing political party that started a website enumerating all the problems with the buildings (he won). Despite the expensive mess in Valencia, Calatrava has also continued to win contracts: London\u2019s next major development, Peninsula Place in Greenwich, is a Calatrava design. The Oculus, for the record, has its own roof problems. The Pearl river bridge The idea for a bridge to span the Pearl river delta, linking Hong Kong to Macau and Zhuhai and thereby joining together the world\u2019s largest urban conurbation, has been around since the 1980s, but took on new life after Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. Construction finally got underway in 2009, with the expectation that the bridge would open in 2016. That date has come and gone, and the $2.3bn bridge may only now receive car traffic starting in 2018. In the meantime, the project has been plagued by engineering problems, construction worker deaths, soaring costs and allegations of corruption. The last of those problems has the potential to push the bridge\u2019s opening date even further into the future, and costs higher. Earlier this year, 21 people were arrested over one company\u2019s role in the construction. Two senior executives and 19 lab technicians are alleged to have falsified test results for the concrete, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. At best, that means there are safety concerns; at worst, two-thirds of the supporting pillars and columns might need replacing. China may soon get its very own bridge to nowhere. The Don Quixote airport Ciudad Real Central airport wasn\u2019t always destined to be a complete flop. It was conceived in the 1990s, when nobody could have known that the global financial crash would cause the Spanish economy to grind to a halt in the same year (2008) that the airport would eventually open. But how, and why, did a small city of 75,000 people in Castile-La Mancha (home of the famous literary fantasist Don Quixote, which has resulted in the nickname the \u201cDon Quixote airport\u201d) become the proposed site for a major international transit point at all? As the BBC explained, it \u201cwas to be a private project, for private profit\u201d, and prior to the economic collapse, money for projects like it was not difficult to come by via local savings banks, which had local politicians \u2013 with eyes trained on infrastructure projects to brag about \u2013 on their boards. In its final year of operation, 2012, the \u20ac1bn airport didn\u2019t receive a single flight. Three years later it was put up for sale; one Chinese-led bid of \u20ac10,000 was rejected for being too low. It was eventually sold to a local group for \u20ac56m and has yet to see any new flights. The bungle of Benidorm In the heady pre-recession days of 2005, Spanish savings bank Caixa Galicia funded what has become one of Europe\u2019s tallest white elephants: the In Tempo apartment block in Benidorm. The developer, Olga Urbana, borrowed \u20ac93m to build a 47-storey M-shaped tower overlooking the Mediterranean; Caixa Galicia itself put up just \u20ac3,100 ($3,650) in seed capital. What followed was a hilarious nightmare. There were immediate construction and design problems. Most notably, the building\u2019s architect didn\u2019t properly design the elevator for 47 stories: instead, it used plans for a 20-storey building and simply extended the lift mechanism another 27 storeys. As Der Spiegel explained, the architect \u201cfailed to consider \u2026 that more stories would also mean more use, or that the space would not be sufficient for the necessary amount of additional lifting equipment\u201d. Despite being mostly complete, the building has yet to be occupied, according to El Mundo, which also recently reported that the building\u2019s mortgage had been sold as part of a \u20ac60m deal between its current holders, Sareb, and SVP Group as part of a plan to finally start selling the units. As for its value to sightseers? One reviewer on TripAdvisor summed it up: \u201cNot an attraction.\u201d Pyongyang\u2019s Hotel of Doom Construction on the Pyongyang Hotel began in 1987, and by most accounts the building is still not quite ready to, you know, host guests. Officially called the Ryugyong, it has been dubbed the \u201cHotel of Doom\u201d out of fears that it is structurally unsound. At conception, the planned 105-storey Ryugyong was meant to be the tallest hotel on earth, complete with casinos and nightclubs. But economics \u2013 specifically, the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1989 \u2013 ruined the party. Construction has limped on ever since; all told, the building is said to have so far cost \u00a3470m. In July, photos showed it mostly empty, with the exterior works unfinished. But in October, on the strength of comments from tourists to North Korea, speculation grew that the hotel could soon open. Watch this space in another 20 years. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 November 2017. An earlier version said the Scarborough subway station would cost C$3bn. This has been corrected to C$3.35bn. Details were also clarified regarding the roof of the City of Arts and Sciences, as well as its cost.",
