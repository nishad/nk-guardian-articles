    "content": "The United States must stop threatening North Korea\u2019s leader if a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis is to be found, China\u2019s ambassador to Washington has said, as Kim Jong-un reiterated his country\u2019s aim to reach military \u201cequilibrium\u201d with the US. Cui Tiankai told reporters in Washington: \u201cThey [the US] should refrain from issuing more threats. They should do more to find effective ways to resume dialogue and negotiation.\u201d \u201cHonestly, I think the United States should be doing \u2026 much more than now, so that there\u2019s real effective international cooperation on this issue.\u201d North Korea\u2019s state news agency, KCNA on Saturday quoted Kim as saying: \u201cOur final goal is to establish the equilibrium of real force with the US and make the US rulers dare not talk about military option.\u201d The US warned on Friday it could revert to military options if the latest sanctions fail to curb North Korean missile and nuclear tests, after Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan for the second time in two weeks. US national security advisor HR McMaster said: \u201cWe have been kicking the can down the road and we\u2019re out of road. For those who have been commenting about the lack of a military option \u2013 there is a military option. Now, it\u2019s not what we prefer to do, so what we have to do is call on all nations to do everything we can to address this global problem, short of war.\u201d Earlier, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson urged Russia and China to \u201cindicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own\u201d. The Chinese ambassador was speaking after Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan for the second time in two weeks a move the UN security council said it \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d. Speaking in Beijing, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said China opposed the launch but also urged the US to change its tactics towards Pyongyang. \u201cChina is not to blame for the escalation of tensions. China does not hold the key to resolving the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, either. Those who tied the knots are responsible for untying [them].\u201d The North Korea issue is likely to take centre stage during Donald Trump\u2019s anticipated state visit to China in November. For months Trump has been struggling to convince Beijing to do more to help him rein in Kim\u2019s regime, using a mixture of public flattery and Twitter diplomacy in his bid to win over the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. \u201cNorth Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success,\u201d Trump tweeted on 3 September after Pyongyang\u2019s sixth nuclear test. Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at Beijing\u2019s Carnegie\u2013Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, said it was too early to tell how the issue might affect Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cMany things can happen between now and then. New developments can emerge that seriously change the calculations,\u201d he said. However, Zhao said it was almost certain Kim would continue his campaign in the lead-up to Trump\u2019s arrival. \u201cWe are likely to see more tests, maybe including another nuclear tests \u2026 It won\u2019t take long before the North Koreans really feel the pain [from the recent UN sanctions]. So I think the North Korean strategy is to use this very short time before they face real problems domestically, to completely conclude their nuclear and missile programs, to achieve all of the key technologies \u2026 So they are likely accelerate and to conduct the tests that are most important for them and then quickly soften their position and come to diplomacy.\u201d The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, echoed McMaster\u2019s strong rhetoric, even as she said Washington\u2019s preferred resolution to the crisis was through diplomacy and sanctions. \u201cWhat we are seeing is, they are continuing to be provocative, they are continuing to be reckless and at that point there\u2019s not a whole lot the security council is going to be able to do from here, when you\u2019ve cut 90% of the trade and 30% of the oil,\u201d Haley said. Trump said he was \u201cmore confident than ever that our options in addressing this threat are both effective and overwhelming\u201d. Speaking from Joint Base Andrews near Washington he said North Korea \u201chas once again shown its utter contempt for its neighbours and for the entire world community\u201d. Russia\u2019s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the US needed to begin talks with North Korea, something that Washington has so far ruled out. \u201cWe called on our US partners and others to implement political and diplomatic solutions that are provided for in the resolution,\u201d Nebenzia told reporters after the security council meeting. \u201cWithout implementing this, we also will consider it as a non-compliance with the resolution.\u201d Asked about the prospect for direct talks, a White House spokesman said: \u201cAs the president and his national security team have repeatedly said, now is not the time to talk to North Korea.\u201d South Korean president Moon Jae-in also said dialogue with the North was impossible at this point. He ordered officials to analyse and prepare for possible new North Korean threats, including electromagnetic pulse and biochemical attacks. The US and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. The North accuses the US, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. Reuters contributed to this report",
