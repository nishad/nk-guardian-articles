    "content": "When cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post died in 1973, she bequeathed her grand Florida estate, built in the 1920s, to the government as a \u201cwinter White House\u201d. But successive presidents didn\u2019t want it and, in 1985, the Post Foundation sold the house to a predatory Manhattan developer for a knock-down price after a bitter battle with the local great and good. No one in Palm Beach could have foreseen that, in 2017, the same man would return as president and use his sun-kissed executive satellite to respond to a minor missile crisis within earshot of very rich golfers. This is Mar-a-Lago, where Donald Trump spent the weekend entertaining the Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe. A photo posted to Instagram and shared on Twitter by a Mexican news anchor shows the leaders and their wives having dinner on the estate\u2019s terrace on Saturday, surrounded by the club\u2019s high-rolling members. The blurry faces of the White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and the national security adviser, Michael Flynn, can be seen behind Trump, who smiles smugly to camera as those behind him deal with the news that North Korea has launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile. Membership at the club is $14,000 (\u00a311,100) a year, after a $200,000 initiation fee (the fee was raised from $100,000 shortly after Trump was inaugurated). Soon after it opened, in 1994, Trump issued a press release announcing that members included Steven Spielberg, Henry Kissinger and Elizabeth Taylor. Charles and Diana, then estranged, had applied separately, it was claimed. Trump later admitted the celebrities had merely received invitations to join. None did. Membership now comes with the potential benefit of presidential face-time. But it also raises questions about national security. \u201cHow many of Mar-a-Lago\u2019s new members will be (already are?) members of foreign intelligence agencies and media organisations?\u201d Chelsea Clinton asked on Twitter. The answer: at least one, judging by a detailed CNN article about the terrace dinner. \u201cAs Mar-a-Lago\u2019s wealthy members looked on from their tables, and with a keyboard player crooning in the background, Trump and Abe\u2019s evening meal quickly morphed into a strategy session, the decision-making on full view to fellow diners,\u201d the network reported. At some point after their starters of iceberg wedge salads with blue-cheese dressing, Bannon, Flynn and other aides used the lights on their smartphones to review paperwork as Abe made it clear he needed to respond to the provocation of Japan\u2019s neighbour. The leaders then repaired to a ballroom, where Abe called the launch \u201cabsolutely intolerable\u201d. Trump didn\u2019t mention it, instead briefly stating that the US \u201cstands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%\u201d. International diplomacy done, CNN reported that Trump then gatecrashed a wedding reception taking place inside his biggest ballroom. He posed for photos before taking the microphone. \u201cI saw them out on the lawn today,\u201d he said of the couple. \u201cI said to the prime minister of Japan, I said: \u2018C\u2019mon Shinz\u014d, let\u2019s go over and say hello.\u2019\u201d The newlyweds had been long-time members of the club, the president added. \u201cThey\u2019ve paid me a fortune.\u201d Local business owners are less impressed by Trump\u2019s new status, fearing that heightened security and attention will put off visitors. Palm Beach airport, where Air Force One lands, reportedly lost $250,000 in fuel and landing-fee sales while it was shut down last weekend. Trump\u2019s Thanksgiving visit cost the Palm Beach sheriff\u2019s office $250,000 in overtime. Team Trump have dismissed ethical as well as security concerns about the official use of Mar-a-Lago, comparing it to George W Bush\u2019s use of his Crawford, Texas ranch (which, crucially, is not a members\u2019 club). In an interview with the New York Times, the president\u2019s son Eric hinted that Abe might not be the last world leader to forge alliances in Palm Beach, saying: \u201cIf he could do that with Putin ... and he can make them friends and they can have trust in one another, he just did something that not many presidents have been able to do.\u201d",
