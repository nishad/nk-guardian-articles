    "content": "North Korea has hailed Tuesday\u2019s summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un as marking the end to hostile relations with the US, with state media depicting the meeting as a diplomatic victory for its leader. Trump offered his own assessment as he landed back on US soil, tweeting that Pyongyang no longer posed a nuclear threat. In its first report on the summit, North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency offered a glowing account of the talks, name-checking Kim 16 times. The front page of the ruling workers\u2019 party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, meanwhile, ran photographs of Kim warmly shaking hands with Trump. It said the \u201cmeeting of the century\u201d was held to bring an end to \u201cextreme, hostile relations\u201d between the countries. KCNA said the talks were \u201cepoch-making\u201d and would help foster \u201ca radical switchover in the most hostile [North Korea]-US relations\u201d. It credited Kim with creating the conditions for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. Trump, KCNA said, \u201cappreciated that an atmosphere of peace and stability was created on the Korean peninsula and in the region, although distressed with the extreme danger of armed clash only a few months ago, thanks to the proactive peace-loving measures taken by the respected Supreme Leader from the outset of this year\u201d. It also celebrated what some have described as Kim\u2019s rapid transformation from reviled dictator to statesman following the positive reception he received in Singapore. \u201cSingapore, the country of the epoch-making meeting much awaited by the whole world, was awash with thousands of domestic and foreign journalists and a large crowd of masses to see this day\u2019s moment which will remain long in history,\u201d it said. The agency added that Kim and Trump had accepted invitations to visit their respective countries. \u201cKim Jong-un invited Trump to visit Pyongyang at a convenient time and Trump invited Kim Jong-un to visit the US. \u201cThe two top leaders gladly accepted each other\u2019s invitation, convinced that it would serve as another important occasion for improved DPRK-US relations,\u201d it said, referencing the country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The summit has been widely regarded as a diplomatic coup for North Korea, which repeated its commitment towards denuclearisation in a joint statement that offered no details of how that would be achieved. In return, Trump, to the surprise of US ally South Korea and his own military, said he would end joint US-South Korea military exercises. Pyongyang considers the annual drills as a rehearsal for invasion. Trump said the drills would not be held while North Korea was still talking. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be doing the war games as long as we\u2019re negotiating in good faith,\u201d he told Fox News Channel. South Korean officials and US military commanders said they had had no advance knowledge of Trump\u2019s announcement. Japan\u2019s defence minister said the US military presence in South Korea and joint military exercises were \u201cvital\u201d for east Asian security. \u201cWe would like to seek an understanding of this between Japan, the US and South Korea,\u201d Itsunori Onodera told reporters. Onodera said Japan would continue joint military exercises with the US and continue to improve its defences against a possible North Korean ballistic missile strike. Some analysts said Trump had made an unnecessary concession. Ending the drills \u201cis in excess of all expert consensus, South Korean requests, and even a close reading of North Korean demands\u201d, said Adam Mount of the Federation of American Scientists. Melissa Hanham of the US-based Center for Nonproliferation Studies pointed out that Pyongyang\u2019s commitment towards denuclearisation was nothing new. The regime had \u201calready promised to do this many times,\u201d she said on Twitter, adding the two sides \u201cstill don\u2019t agree on what \u2018denuclearisation\u2019 means\u201d. On Wednesday, Trump again hailed the summit as historic. The release last month of three Americans being held by North Korea was secured during a surprise visit to Pyongyang by the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. The date for Tuesday\u2019s summit was set just hours after Tony Kim, Kim Hak-song and Kim Dong Chul arrived back in the US. In another tweet on Wednesday, Trump thanked Kim for taking \u201cthe first bold step toward a bright new future for his people\u201d, adding, \u201cOur unprecedented meeting ... proves that real change is possible!\u201d Just before Air Force One took of from Singapore on Tuesday evening, Trump said he believed that Kim \u2013 whom he referred to as \u201clittle rocket man\u201d last year \u2013 was a leader with whom he could do business. \u201cI can only tell you that from the time I\u2019ve dealt with him, which is really starting 90 days ago ... I think he wants to get it done,\u201d Trump said when asked if he had any doubts about Kim\u2019s sincerity. The president said Kim had immediately agreed to his request to return the remains of American prisoners of war and those who went missing in action during the 1950-53 Korean war. \u201cAs soon as I had my first opportunity, which was toward the end, I said could you do it. He said we will do it.\u201d But he was still vague on how Washington intended to verify denuclearisation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to check it and we will check it. We\u2019ll check it very strongly.\u201d Asked if he trusted Kim, Trump said: \u201cI do.\u201d During Tuesday\u2019s summit, Kim said it was \u201curgent\u201d for North Korea and the US to halt \u201cirritating and hostile military actions against each other\u201d, KCNA reported. \u201cKim Jong-un and Trump had the shared recognition to the effect that it is important to abide by the principle of step-by-step and simultaneous action in achieving peace, stability and denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d it reported. The North Korean leader was quoted as saying the regime could take more goodwill measures if the US reciprocated with genuine measures to build trust, and that the two countries should take legal and institutional steps to avoid antagonising each other. The report added that Trump said he \u201cunderstood\u201d. South Korean media were generally positive about the talks, but pointed out that important questions remained over the process and timing of North Korean denuclearisation. \u201cThe summit fell short of expectations of a road map for denuclearisation, but the issue of dismantling the North Korean nuclear programme and assuring the security of its regime \u2013 two key agenda items of the summit \u2013 are as difficult to solve as a tangled knot,\u201d the Korea Herald said in an editorial. The paper cautioned against any reduction in US forces based in South Korea, saying the bilateral alliance was key to South Korean president Moon Jae-in\u2019s ability to foster further cross-border detente and implement the agreement. \u201cFor Moon to perform the role well, it is important to uphold a solid Korea-US alliance. The alliance is the basis of South Korea\u2019s diplomacy and security. At its core are the US forces stationed in Korea\u201d, it said.",
