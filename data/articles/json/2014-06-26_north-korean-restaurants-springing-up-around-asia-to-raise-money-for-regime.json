    "content": "At precisely 7.30pm, the waitresses put down their trays and start to perform. Wearing traditional Korean Choson-ot dresses in bright colours, they dance to a curious mix of western pop covers and North Korean national songs. We're in a vast, strip-lit venue that serves up dog stew washed down with soju and some form of kimchi in virtually every dish \u2013 but the restaurant\u2019s main selling point is that it offers a window onto the world\u2019s most secretive state. Welcome to Pyongyang restaurant in Phnom Penh, one of a chain of eateries owned by Office 39, an arm of the North Korean government, that have sprung up across Asia since the 1990s to channel money back to the regime On the night we visit the Phnom Penh branch is packed with hundreds of diners, mostly Cambodian and South Korean men. TripAdvisor reviews give the chain an average four star rating and offer praise such as \u201ca second degree kitsch experience\u201d and \u201cauthentic North Korean style\u201d. According to North Korean expert and author Bertil Lintner the restaurants have several financial benefits for the regime: \u201cThe North Korean government runs those restaurants to a) raise foreign exchange for the government in Pyongyang, b) to finance the activities of the North Korean embassy in the country where a restaurant is located, and c) to launder money from other activities,\u201d he says, adding that restaurants are \u201cperfect vehicles\u201d for money-laundering. The first handful of Pyongyang Restaurants sprang up in northern China, near the border with the DPRK during the 1990s. But the 21st century brought with it a boom - with an estimated 100 branches across Asia. In 2012 a Pyongyang restaurant opened in Amsterdam, the first in Europe. It closed after a few months but another re-opened at the end of last year. They may seem like a harmless tourist attraction, but the money is used to prop up a state accused of grave human rights abuses against its people, say experts. Waitresses staffing the restaurants are not free to come and go, for fear they will escape. James Hoare, a North Korean specialist at Soas University of London and former British charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Pyongyang, said the waitresses, who are recruited partly because they are from politically loyal families, live in compounds near the premises. \u201cThey would be from the political elite; the sort of people who live and work in Pyongyang. Nobody else gets to go abroad,\u201d he said. The reason for this, he adds, is that they are less likely to escape. And to escape is to defect. Recently a waitress at one of the Pyongyang restaurants fled to Thailand with a South Korean man, sparking fresh tensions between the Koreas. There are fears her that her family back home will be made to suffer because of her behaviour. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official at a Pyongyang restaurant said that although waitresses were allowed to leave the compound to \u201cgo shopping\u201d, to escape would be to defect and would surely result in government punishment. He said the restaurant was owned by \u201ca company\u201d that sponsors the North Korean national football team. \u201cActually my restaurant is involved in sports investment,\u201d he said. Asked if waitresses are allowed to go out and socialise with non-North Koreans, he asked: \u201cWhy would they want to do that? They don\u2019t want to go out and meet people!\u201d \u2022 Read more about the Pyongyang restaurant chain",
