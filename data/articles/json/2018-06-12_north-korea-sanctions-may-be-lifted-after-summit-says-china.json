    "content": "Seoul has reacted with a mixture of optimism and confusion to the historic summit between Donald Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, after the US president announced an end to joint military exercises with South Korea. Leaders from around the region sought to capitalise on the momentum of the meeting, which resulted in a signed agreement that was light on substance but held up by Trump as a victory. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, welcomed the outcome of the summit and praised the \u201ccourage and determination of the two leaders\u201d. \u201cThis is just a beginning and there may be many difficulties ahead but we will never go back to the ways of the past and never give up on this bold journey,\u201d Moon said in a statement. \u201cIt is a great victory achieved by both the United States and the two Koreas, and a huge step forward for people across the world who long for peace.\u201d But Trump\u2019s pledge to halt longstanding military drills with South Korea sparked widespread confusion. The exercises have been repeatedly criticised by Pyongyang, which in the past has responded with missile tests. The South Korean military issued a statement to NBC News saying: \u201cRegarding President Trump\u2019s comment regarding ending of the combined military drills \u2026 we need to find out the exact meaning or intention behind his comments at this point.\u201d For its part, North Korea agreed to \u201cwork towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d, language which was open to interpretation and fell short of Washington\u2019s long-stated goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal. No report of the summit was broadcast on North Korean television, where it is not uncommon for news to be delayed or even ignored. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, praised the agreement\u2019s references to denuclearisation and said he was willing to engage with Pyongyang to resolve the cold war abductions of Japanese citizens by North Korean spies. \u201cI\u2019m determined that Japan will have to directly face North Korea and resolve [the abductions] bilaterally,\u201d Abe said. China also appeared to want to seize on the positive atmosphere. \u201cThe United States and North Korea have been in a state of antagonism for more than half a century,\u201d said the foreign minister, Wang Yi. \u201cToday, that the two countries\u2019 highest leaders can sit together and have equal talks has important and positive meaning and is creating a new history.\u201d China suggested the international community could consider lifting economic sanctions on North Korea. \u201cSanctions are a means, not an end,\u201d said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs. \u201cThe [UN] security council\u2019s actions should support and conform to the efforts of current diplomatic talks towards denuclearising the Korean peninsula.\u201d The comment by Chinese officials suggests the US policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Pyongyang until it relinquishes nuclear weapons is already showing signs of cracking. There have been reports that Kim\u2019s charm offensive over recent months has led China to relax restrictions on trade with North Korea, violating UN sanctions. Trump alluded to relaxed Chinese restrictions, which have come without substantial concessions from Pyongyang, in a press conference in which he also praised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for implementing sanctions. \u201cHe really closed up that border \u2026 but maybe not in the last couple of months but that\u2019s OK,\u201d the president said. At a train station in Seoul, people cheered and applauded as televisions screens broadcast the Trump-Kim handshake live. But the reaction among many South Koreans was disappointment, and in the community of North Korean refugees now living south of the border there was a feeling of betrayal. Choi Jung-hoon, a member of the North Korean Liberation Front, a quasi-military group that advocates for the overthrow of the regime in Pyongyang, said he was furious at the outcome of the summit, which had led to \u201conly good things for Kim Jong-un\u201d. Choi was an army officer in North Korea\u2019s cyber-hacking unit for almost 20 years before he escaped in 2006. \u201cTrump completely lost to Kim, he was dragged around by Kim,\u201d Choi said. \u201cThis has all been a political show by Trump, North Korea got away with everything they wanted. They said they will \u2018denuclearise\u2019, nothing has been said in detail.\u201d Choi was dismayed that the US demand for complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement was absent from the agreement, and he was particularly disappointed human rights were not prominently featured. The UN estimates North Korea is holding up to 120,000 political prisoners and says the regime is guilty of crimes against humanity. Another refugee, Jung Gwang-il, who works to smuggle information into North Korea, said he was \u201cmoderately disappointed\u201d. He previously worked at state-run trading companies but was later sent to a labour camp and tortured. He arrived in South Korea in 2004. \u201cPromising security for Kim\u2019s regime will mean he can stay in power and will just keep on oppressing the North Korean people,\u201d Jung said. \u201cIf denuclearisation happens while people in North Korea are dying, it\u2019s pointless.\u201d Many North Koreans who have fled over the border are deeply suspicious of the Kim family, with many having suffered physical or mental abuse at the hands of the regime. Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, said the summit proved that diplomacy was the right path to follow, as the bloc had done on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Trump derided and abandoned last month.
