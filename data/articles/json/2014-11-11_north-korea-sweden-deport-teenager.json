    "content": "A teenager who claims to have escaped from North Korea is facing deportation from Sweden \u2013 in part because authorities misspelled the names of places he mentioned in his asylum interviews. The Swedish migration board wants to send the 17-year-old to China, where it believes he is from, after ruling last year that there was not enough evidence that he is North Korean. But the teenager, who has not been named, says he faces torture or death if sent to China, which he claims will send him back to North Korea. Sweden\u2019s national radio broadcaster reported last week that one of the reasons the asylum request was rejected was because immigration officials had been unable to find the locations the teenager mentioned when interviewed. An investigation launched by his lawyer suggested that this was because the place names had been misspelled by interviewers. A Korean expert hired to assess the teenager\u2019s dialect by a controversial Swedish linguistic company that evaluates asylum applications told journalists that his strong dialect had left her in no doubt that he came from North Korea. The company, Sprakab, nevertheless concluded in its report that his dialect did not fit with his story of growing up in North Korea\u2019s northern districts. The woman, who has not been named, accused the company her of twisting her words in its report. \u201cI never said that he didn\u2019t come from North Korea,\u201dshe said. \u201cWhat they are saying is wrong. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d The teenager has appealed against the decision. \u201cIf I go back to North Korea then I will die,\u201d he told Swedish radio. His lawyer, Arido Dagavro, said he had proof that the places the teenager had mentioned did in fact exist, as well as testimony from other North Korean refugees that he had spoken with a recognisable dialect from North Hamgyong province in recorded interviews. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the migration board didn\u2019t have the expertise required to take a decision in this matter,\u201d Degavro said. Kristina Sandklef, a China analyst who is advising Degavro, said the expert\u2019s comments on the way the teenager\u2019s Korean was often ungrammatical and included elements of other dialects picked up in a decade living as a roaming kotjebi or streetchild had been misinterpreted. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect \u2018grammatically correct\u2019 for someone who\u2019s never been to school,\u201d she said. The teenager claims to have fled across the river bordering China when it was frozen in early spring, to escape the authorities, who had begun rounding up homeless people in its northern districts before opening them up to tourism. He said he had lived undercover in China for two periods of up to a year, which the Swedish authorities took to mean that he faced no threat in the country. \u201cA new UN report on North Korea said that it\u2019s very common for people in the north to cross the border into China and go back, because they are starving. The immigration department didn\u2019t believe this,\u201d Degavro claimed. \u201cThey said the border should be well secured by the North Koreans. But it\u2019s not.\u201d Sprakab\u2019s claims that its staff can judge asylum seekers\u2019 origins through analysing their dialect is facing mounting criticism, including in the UK, where it has advised the Home Office since 2000. In May the company was condemned by the UK supreme court for giving \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d judgements on a series of cases involving Somali immigrants. The court expressed \u201cserious questions about the basis on which the Sprakab analysts [feel] able to establish with such certainty geographical allocation of the appellants\u2019 modes of speech.\u201d But Sweden\u2019s migration board said last week it remained confident in the company. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything to make us have an opinion that Sprakab is not reliable or lacks the competence to do these things,\u201d said press chief Fredrik Bengtsson. The migration board, which has yet to decide whether it will reopen the case, denied that the teenager risked being sent to North Korea. \u201cIf the Chinese authorities say that they don\u2019t think he\u2019s a Chinese citizen and he has no permit to stay in China, then we will not be able to send him back to China,\u201d Bengtsson said. But the teenager\u2019s lawyer dismissed this as naive, given close relations between the Chinese and North Korean governments.",
