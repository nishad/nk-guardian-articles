    "content": "Sitting on deep leather sofas in the North Korean embassy \u2013 stationed in a 1930s family home in Acton, west London \u2013 ambassador Hyon Hak-bong is poring over Kim Jong-un\u2019s New Year\u2019s address. Like many of his fellow devout citizens, the North Korean ambassador to the UK starts many of his sentences by quoting the \u201ceternal president\u201d Kim Il-sung, the \u201cdear leader\u201d Kim Jong-il, or the \u201cbrilliant comrade\u201d Kim Jong-un. Armed with a highlighter, he helpfully marks the passages from the address he believes are particularly relevant. \u201cIf aggressors dare to provoke us, even to the slightest degree, we will never tolerate it but will respond resolutely with a merciless sacred war of justice,\u201d said Kim on 1 January on the subject of national security. Two days later, North Korean state media would triumphantly claim that the regime had completed a successful \u201chydrogen bomb\u201d test. This was a key point, according to Hyon: \u201cWe develop nuclear weapons not to threaten the world with war but to protect our independence. We want peace, but our nation has been victimised for centuries by one invader and then another.\u201d What does Hyon say to claims from experts that the country\u2019s nuclear might has been overstated? \u201cExperts around the world, even in South Korea, know that the DPRK has developed enriched uranium and achieved the nuclear fusion process, and therefore is at our level of expertise to detonate a hydrogen bomb,\u201d he replied. He declined to go into specifics, but said: \u201cWe have been forced to develop nuclear capabilities. It is only by having a deterrent that we can focus fully on economic matters.\u201d The economy Using the New Year\u2019s speech as his guide, the ambassador returned to the contents of Kim\u2019s address, pointing out that the leader had promised to improve the struggling economy. \u201cWe have huge potential,\u201d said Hyon. \u201cSince our great leader Kim Jong-il died four years ago, Kim Jong-un has made tremendous achievements. There have been a number of significant monuments built, commemorating our attainments in science and technology.\u201d A fundamental change to North Korea\u2019s economy under the young Kim has been the increased use of private markets, allowing people to buy anything from electronics to cosmetics and food. But asked about Korean scholar Andrei Lankov\u2019s claims that these markets are an integral part of the North Korean economy, Hyon is dismissive. \u201cThat is ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cLankov has never visited my country and is imagining things to make a good story. \u201cIt is true that markets are available for trading certain goods that the state cannot provide,\u201d he added, \u201cbut this does not contradict with socialism. This commercial trading is tolerated by the government and welcomed by the people, but it is nonsense that it supersedes the socialist system.\u201d Also \u201cnonsense\u201d, according to Hyon, are any claims of human rights violations in the DPRK. In particular, the UN\u2019s 2014 periodic review of the country \u2013 a process conducted by the UN\u2019s Human Rights Council every four and a half years, which made 268 recommendations for human rights improvements, of which the DPRK accepted 113. Among the accepted recommendations were that the DPRK should strengthen domestic legal frameworks, improve rights for women and children, and advance social wellbeing. Those rejected? That North Korea should abolish public executions and generic crimes such as \u201ccrimes against the state\u201d. Hyon brands accusations of human rights abuses against North Korea as \u201cstupid, stupid\u201d, and maintains that defectors are merely \u201cspreading slander\u201d. To emphasise his point, he returns again to Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s address, where the leader mentions that all efforts should now be focused on \u201cbuilding an economic giant\u201d to \u201cimprove the people\u2019s standard of living\u201d. Gesturing respectfully towards the carefully framed portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il on the wall (each with flowers lovingly arranged beneath), Hyon said that \u201cour leaders have always travelled the country and formed policy from the people\u2019s ideas and concerns. \u201cThe philosophy of socialism is all about serving the masses and improving their livelihood. How can the media say we do not respect our people?\u201d The great leaders It is on the subject of North Korea\u2019s leaders that Hyon is his most passionate. Highlighted by an incident in April 2014 when two officials from the embassy asked a nearby hair salon to remove a poster of Kim Jong-un emblazoned with the words \u201cbad hair day?\u201d. So why are North Koreans so affronted by such jokes? \u201cWe respect our leaders completely,\u201d said Hyon, his hand pressed to his heart. \u201cThey share our sorrows and our happiness. They are our fathers. They do not sleep well because they toil every day and night for the people.\u201d \u201cWhen Kim Jong-il died, the people\u2019s tears were real. The western media insinuated that the people were forced to cry, but that is ridiculous. You cannot force someone to cry.\u201d And what does he think of the British satire directed at the UK\u2019s political leaders? \u201cI don\u2019t know about jokes directed at David Cameron,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think people should make fun of the Queen. People should always show respect to the head of state.\u201d But undoubtedly the main point Hyon returns to is that the reunification of the Korean peninsula \u2013 \u201cthe ultimate goal of every Korean\u201d. Despite the immense social upheaval it would involve and the astronomical cost \u2013 estimates suggest sums of between $50bn (\u00a334.7bn) to more than $3tn \u2013 Hyon insists that reunification is still possible. \u201cWe want to replace the armistice agreement created at the end of the Korean war with a peace pact. Without any foreign interference \u2013 especially from the US \u2013 we want to create a sovereign state of Korea. This is our dream.\u201d And with a flourish, Hyon highlights the slogan that Kim declared should be cherished by the people in 2016. \u201cLet us frustrate the final challenges by the anti-reunification forces within and without, and usher in a new era of independent reunification!\u201d",
