    "content": "Just when you thought the fallout from John Sweeney's undercover Panorama trip to North Korea with a group from the London School of Economics had died down, the story has taken a turn for the bizarre. An electropop outfit named Ooberfuse has released a song denouncing the Kim dynasty \u2013 and it turns out the lead singer of the band is none other than a London School of Economics alumni. The curious blend of repetitive politico-pop is hardly to Monkey's taste, but it hits the right notes for Sweeney, who has been tweeting liberally about the song.",
