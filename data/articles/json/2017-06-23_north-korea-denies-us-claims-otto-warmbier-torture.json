    "content": "North Korea has accused the US of conducting a smear campaign against the regime over Otto Warmbier, the American student who was sent home in a coma after 17 months in prison. The 22-year-old, who died on 19 June \u2013 just over a week after being flown home to Ohio \u2013 had spent a year suffering from a severe brain injury that North Korean doctors claimed had been caused by a heart attack and taking a pill for botulism. In North Korea\u2019s first public comment on Warmbier\u2019s death, a spokesman for the foreign ministry said claims that Warmbier was beaten and tortured in captivity were \u201cgroundless\u201d. \u201cThe fact that Warmbier died suddenly less than a week after his return to the US in his normal state of health \u2026 is a mystery to us as well,\u201d the spokesman said, according to the KCNA state news agency. Warmbier was arrested in January last year and sentenced to 15 years\u2019 hard labour for allegedly attempting to steal a propaganda poster from a staff-only area of his hotel in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. He was released this month in what North Korea described as a \u201chumanitarian gesture\u201d. The spokesman, who was not named, said American doctors who travelled to North Korea to carry out Warmbier\u2019s medical evacuation had recognised that he had been given medical treatment and, despite his serious health condition, had been sent to the US alive. He added: \u201cAlthough we had no reason at all to show mercy to such a criminal of the enemy state, we provided him with medical treatment and care with all sincerity on a humanitarian basis until his return to the US, considering that his health got worse.\u201d He claimed Warmbier had been the victim of Barack Obama\u2019s policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d towards the regime, since he had never requested the student\u2019s release during his presidency. This week Donald Trump said Warmbier\u2019s death was a \u201ctotal disgrace\u201d, adding that if he had been brought home sooner \u201cthe result would have been a lot different\u201d. Asked on Friday about North Korea\u2019s claim that Warmbier\u2019s death was a mystery, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a mystery. I think we know very well what happened and I think, as the president said, it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d The US defence secretary, Jim Mattis, said Washington\u2019s patience with Pyongyang was running out. \u201cTo see a young man go over there healthy and, [after] a minor act of mischief, come home dead basically \u2026 this goes beyond any kind of understanding of law and order, of humanity, of responsibility toward any human being,\u201d he said. In response, North Korea accused Washington of conducting a smear campaign that \u201ccompels us to make firm determination that humanitarianism and benevolence for the enemy are a taboo and we should further sharpen the blade of law\u201d. KCNA quoted an unnamed spokesman for the country\u2019s National Reconciliation Council as saying: \u201cOur relevant agencies treat all criminals \u2026 thoroughly in accordance with domestic laws and international standards and Warmbier was not an exception. \u201cThose who have absolutely no idea about how well we treated Warmbier under humanitarian conditions dare to utter \u2018mistreatment\u2019 and \u2018torture\u2019.\u201d A US State Department spokesperson refused to comment on North Korea\u2019s assertion that Warmbier was not tortured while in custody. \u201cWe have made clear that we hold North Korea accountable for Otto Warmbier\u2019s unjust imprisonment, and we want to see the three other Americans who are unjustly detained in North Korea come home as soon as possible,\u201d the spokesperson said. The cause of Warmbier\u2019s death remains a mystery. Doctors who treated him at the University of Cincinnati medical centre said he was badly brain damaged when he arrived from North Korea in what they termed a state of \u201cunresponsive wakefulness\u201d. They carried out an external examination but his parents asked local coroners not to conduct an autopsy. They blamed their son\u2019s death on the \u201cthe awful torturous mistreatment\u201d he received in North Korea. On Thursday, thousands of mourners turned out for Warmbier\u2019s funeral in Cincinnati, where the streets were adorned with blue and white ribbons in a show of support.
