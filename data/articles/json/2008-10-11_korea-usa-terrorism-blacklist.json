    "content": "The United States today removed North Korea from its terrorism blacklist in an attempt to salvage a nuclear disarmament deal before George Bush leaves office. In a move that has drawn criticism from the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, the state department announced it no longer regarded North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. In return, Pyongyang has agreed to all US nuclear inspection demands. The secretive communist country would return to the list if it fails to comply with inspections of its nuclear facilities as part of the effort to persuade it to abandon its pursuit of atomic weapons. The move comes as North Korea has restarted a disabled nuclear reactor and taken other provocative steps, including test-firing missiles and expelling UN inspectors. Such moves have heightened tensions with the US and threatened the shaky agreement. It also follows days of intense internal debate in Washington and consultations with America's negotiating partners China, South Korea, Russia and Japan. Tokyo had balked at the move because North Korea had not resolved issues related to its abduction of Japanese citizens. The decision has been planned since the US's chief negotiator, Christopher Hill, returned from a trip to North Korea late last week. During his visit, he pressed North Korea to accept a plan to verify its accounting of nuclear activities. The move has drawn criticism from conservatives who believe the US is rewarding North Korea for bad behaviour. McCain said in a statement he would not support the step unless it was clear North Korea was serious about disarmament and would accept intrusive inspections of its nuclear sites. \"I expect the administration to explain exactly how this new verification agreement advances American interests and those of our allies before I will be able to support any decision to remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism,\" he said. McCain said he was \"concerned that this latest agreement appears to have been reached between Washington and Pyongyang and only then discussed with our Asian allies in an effort to garner their support\". Yesterday, US officials said they were trying to build a consensus among negotiating partners on the decision and on inspection rules that Washington insists must accompany removing North Korea from the list. North Korea, along with Iran and Iraq, were branded as part of an \"axis of evil\" by Bush after the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001.",
