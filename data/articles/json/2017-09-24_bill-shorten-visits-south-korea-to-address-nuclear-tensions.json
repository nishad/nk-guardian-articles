    "content": "Australia\u2019s opposition leader, Bill Shorten, will meet with South Korea\u2019s prime minister as part of a bid to reassure the region that Australia\u2019s position on North Korea will not change, even if there is a change in government. Shorten and his foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, have left for a four-day trip to South Korea and Japan, with meetings scheduled with Lee Nak-yeon, the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon, the commander of the US Forces in Korea, Gen Vincent Brooks, and Japan\u2019s foreign minister, Taro Kono. The trip comes just days after the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, used her address to the United Nations general assembly to condemn North Korea\u2019s ongoing nuclear and missile provocations, and to call on the rogue nation\u2019s allies China and Russia to continue applying pressure. On his way to the political hotspot, Shorten said North Korea was one area where Labor and the Coalition were in lockstep. \u201cSouth Korea and Japan are critical to the economic and national security of our region,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is therefore important at a critical time, that both sides of Australian politics have the best possible understanding so we can make the best possible decisions. \u201cAnd to be very clear, that this escalating tension in the Korean peninsula is a matter which goes towards the security of the region, but the broader world. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is very important that all nations, including China and Russia, support the increased United Nations security council resolutions to put all possible pressure on the North Korean regime.\u201d China has agreed to the latest sanctions, which include restricting its fuel exports to North Korea and putting a ban on Pyongyang\u2019s second-biggest export, textiles. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has pushed for China to do more, including cutting off the oil pipeline which provides North Korea with much of its fuel. Donald Trump used his first speech to the general assembly to warn the United States would \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if it continued its weapons programs. North Korea responded by threatening to detonate a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean. The speech, and Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, where he refers to Kim Jong-un as \u201cRocket Man\u201d has resulted in an escalating war of words between the two leaders. A series of small earthquakes in North Korea this weekend sparked fears of another nuclear test, but experts believe the tremors to be natural.",
