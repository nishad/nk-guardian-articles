    "content": "The leaders of North and South Korea have vowed to \u201cwrite a new chapter\u201d in their peninsula\u2019s troubled history at the start of a summit that has raised hopes for a resolution over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. On a bright spring morning Kim Jong-un and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, reached across a simple concrete slab marking the border between their countries and shook hands for more than 20 seconds. After an exchange of words and broad smiles, Kim became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, planting a foot over the military demarcation line watched by dignitaries from both sides and millions following live TV coverage. Then came the first unscripted moment of the summit: a suggestion by Kim, dressed in his trademark black Mao-style suit, that both men step back across the border into North Korea after Moon reportedly asked him: \u201cWhen do I get to visit the North?\u201d After a brief moment on the northern side, they returned to pose for photos with schoolchildren who had presented Kim with a bouquet of flowers. As they inspected a guard of honour, a military band played Korean folk songs familiar to people on both sides of the border and South Korea\u2019s version of Hail to the Chief. In early accounts of the closed morning session given by South Korean officials, Kim told Moon that he \u201cwon\u2019t interrupt your early morning sleep any more\u201d with ballistic missile tests. Moon said there had been \u201cvery good discussion today\u201d. After entering the Peace House, the venue for the talks, Kim wrote in the guestbook: \u201cNew history starts from now, at the historic starting point of an era of peace.\u201d Moments later, in an adjacent meeting room, he said he wanted to hold \u201cheartfelt, sincere and honest\u201d talks, and hoped the summit would produce a \u201cgood outcome\u201d. \u201cI hope to write a new chapter between us, this is the starting point for us. We will make a new beginning,\u201d added Kim, seated next to his increasingly influential sister, Kim Yo-jong. \u201cIt has taken 11 years for this historic moment to happen. Walking here, I wondered why it has taken so long. \u201cThrough today\u2019s meeting, I hope we won\u2019t go back to square one again and that there won\u2019t be a repeat of the non-implementation of what we agree,\u201d he added, referring to failed past deals on nuclear weapons and inter-Korean co-operation. \u201cI hope we can live up to people\u2019s exceptions.\u201d Earlier a North Korean security team conducted a sweep for explosives and listening devices, as well as spraying what appeared to be disinfectant in the air, on the chairs and on the guest book, according to Reuters. More substantive talks got under way behind closed doors in a room that was specially refurbished in anticipation of Kim\u2019s visit. The two leaders sat exactly 2,018 millimetres apart \u2013 in a nod to the year of their historic summit \u2013 on opposite sides of a specially designed table with gentle, rounded edges. They sat on chairs with backrests that feature a Korean peninsula design. In a lighthearted moment, Kim acknowledged the interest being shown in the North Korean noodles he had brought with him to be served at an evening banquet. After initially saying it had been hard to bring them all the way from Pyongyang, he turned to his sister and joked: \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have said [Pyongyang] was far.\u201d Kim\u2019s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will join her husband, Moon and his wife, Kim Jung-sook, for the dinner after the talks have ended, South Korean officials said. Ri, a former singer who was recently given the title of first lady, will be making her second appearance at a leadership summit, having accompanied Kim on his trip last month to Beijing, where they met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Moon, a left-leaning liberal who has long supported engagement with the North, said the whole world was paying attention to the \u201cspring\u201d that had arrived on the Korean peninsula, and described their meeting as both an \u201copportunity\u201d and a \u201cburden\u201d. \u201cPeople around the world have high hopes,\u201d said Moon, who was elected president last May promising to defuse the growing nuclear crisis on the peninsula. \u201cYour visit makes the military demarcation line a symbol of peace, not division. I thank you very much for your courage. Our dialogue and talks today will be very frank. We will finally have the dialogue we haven\u2019t been able to have for the past decade.\u201d The details of their talks will not be clear until later on Friday, and some analysts predicted the meeting, while highly symbolic, would produce little of substance on denuclearisation and a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that brought a halt to the Korean war 65 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s high on symbolism and definitely exciting, but you have to ask yourself what does the symbolism amount to?\u201d said Van Jackson, a former policy adviser to the US secretary of defence who focuses on Asia. \u201cBoth men have a strong desire to make this look good, but I don\u2019t see anything coming out of this except building momentum for a Kim-Trump meeting.\u201d Kim wants to be a normal, upstanding and respected member of the international community, but wants to do that while having nuclear weapons, Jackson said, adding any meeting with Trump would aid in furthering that goal. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have good vibes going into the Trump summit, but you need to put emotion aside and wonder what this means on the question of nukes, which is not much,\u201d he said. \u201cKim says he wants peace and denuclearisation, but what that means to him won\u2019t be acceptable to South Korea or the US.\u201d Other countries welcomed the first meeting between the countries\u2019 leaders for more than a decade. The White House said in a statement: \u201cWe wish the Korean people well. We are hopeful that talks will achieve progress to where a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean peninsula. The US appreciates the close coordination with our ally, the Republic of Korea and looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks.\u201d Japan\u2019s defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said Tokyo hoped the summit would lead to demonstrable progress on North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear programmes, and a resolution of the regime\u2019s cold war abductions of Japanese nationals. \u201cJapan will be watching closely for signs that North Korea is taking action on these issues,\u201d he said. Kim Chang-su from the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses, said the leaders\u2019 greeting made him optimistic about the summit. Referring to the leaders\u2019 brief moment on North Korean soil, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s very surprising, but that\u2019s a sign of harmony, rather than just one side forcing these talks on the other. It was a bold gesture by Kim Jong-un. \u201cSo far these seem to be very open minded discussions, a sign that we are heading to a new era of peace.\u201d",
