    "title": "From missiles to moisturiser: Kim Jong-un visits North Korean cosmetics factory",

    "content": "Kim Jong-un may or may not be a regular user of exfoliant scrub and moisturiser, but the North Korean leader was every inch the attentive consumer when he swapped ballistic missiles for bars of soap during a visit to a cosmetics factory. While James Mattis, the US defence secretary, was saying Washington would never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea, Kim was offering \u201cfield guidance\u201d at the weekend to factory workers in the latest display of his more genteel side, according to the official KCNA news agency. The visit was notable, too, for the identity of his companions \u2013 the two most powerful women in North Korea. Photographs showed Kim\u2019s wife, Ri Sol-ju, who is rarely seen in public. His younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, whom he recently appointed to the ruling party\u2019s powerful politburo, was also present but stayed out of shot, reports said. They were accompanied by two senior party officials. The Pyongyang cosmetics factory, which has reportedly been refitted with energy-saving technology, \u201chas turned into a model and standard for the nation\u2019s cosmetics factories,\u201d KCNA said. Kim hailed its \u201cworld-level\u201d products, saying they would help women \u201cwho want to be beautiful\u201d realise their dream, the agency added. He also praised the variety of products and described their packaging as \u201cvery nice\u201d. He added that when his father, Kim Jong-il, had visited the same factory in 2003 he called on workers and officials to produce more cosmetics of \u201cgood quality with world competitive power\u201d. South Korea\u2019s cosmetics industry is booming, thanks largely to Chinese consumers, but the North is thought to have developed its domestic light industry to counter the shortage of imported luxury goods caused by UN sanctions. It wasn\u2019t Kim\u2019s first tour of the capital\u2019s cosmetics factory, or the first time he has talked up the potential for North Korean products to become globally recognised brands, according to North Korean Economy Watch. The website said he visited cosmetics and shoe factories in the capital in early 2015, and \u201cdirectly mentioned famous overseas brands and repeatedly called for the production of world-class products\u201d. Like Kim Jong-il before him, Kim is an occasional visitor to factories and farms, but is said to be more at ease around ordinary people than his late father. Official photographs often show a beaming Kim as he inspects displays of everything from children\u2019s trainers to footballs and kimchi. Kim\u2019s weekend outing contrasted with the increasingly tense situation on the Korean peninsula, fuelled by Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions and exchanges of threats and insults between Pyongyang and Donald Trump. Speaking in Seoul on Saturday, Mattis repeated the president\u2019s warning that any use of nuclear weapons by North Korea would be met with a \u201cmassive military response\u201d. Mattis added: \u201cMake no mistake \u2013 any attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated. And any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is both effective and overwhelming.\u201d",
