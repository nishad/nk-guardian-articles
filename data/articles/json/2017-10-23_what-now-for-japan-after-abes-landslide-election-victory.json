    "content": "After Shinzo Abe\u2019s crushing defeat of the opposition in Sunday\u2019s election five Japan experts give their views on what lies ahead for the country \u2013 and the region. We need to talk about pacifism A mature debate about constitutional reform is exactly what Japan needs right now. It\u2019s extremely important, but it\u2019s been largely sidetracked by ideological disagreements from both the left and right. The left insists that the pacifist Article 9 must remain untouched. That\u2019s not a realistic proposition because the world has changed and Article 9 is now something of an anachronism. It\u2019s not realistic to keep it in the current environment, with Chinese ambitions and uncertainty over the US\u2019s willingness to continue contributing to regional security in the way it has done before. It\u2019s unavoidable that countries like Japan and Australia need to contribute more to help keep the status quo in place. I can\u2019t see any country in the region, with the exceptions of China and North Korea, opposing a more normal security stance by Japan. Gone are the days when south-east Asia and Australia were concerned about a revival of Japanese militarism. In terms of Japan\u2019s relations with the US, if Japan wants to maintain its alliance with the US and build security relations with others then the benefits have to go both ways. As we know, these days Washington has no time for freeloaders on security. Michael Heazle, associate professor at Griffith University in Brisbane Abe\u2019s dream of change is within his grasp Liberalism is on life-support in 21st century Japan as the political centre has shifted rightward, but Yukio Edano\u2019s Constitutional Democratic party caught fire and is the Cinderella story of his election. Edano represents principled uncompromising resistance to constitutional revision and favours repeal of the 2015 security legislation that most of the public also oppose. He will also tap into public perceptions that Abenomics is welfare for the wealthy and has caused growing disparities in Japanese society. Edano is now the torchbearer of liberalism in Japan, and even if the flame now seems flickering, his party is well positioned to expose Abe\u2019s shortcomings and flaws. Abe sees that his dream (of constitutional revision) is within his grasp. Although public opinion now is not in favour of revision, if he pushes revisions through the Diet and holds a national referendum there will be a massive PR campaign to persuade the public to back the proposals. With a little help from Pyongyang and Beijing, I wager the chances are fairly good Abe can prevail. Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo Don\u2019t expect major changes Abe\u2019s retention of a small supermajority makes it easier to pass a constitutional amendment bill in the lower house. But there will be no major shifts in economic policy. On security, it will remain the case that the Japan-US alliance equals good, and North Korea bad. The Party of Hope briefly emerged as a viable alternative to the ruling coalition. Suffice it to say that the Tokyo governor, Yuriko Koike, again displayed her worst traits \u2013 an inability to take counsel and a penchant for secretive decision-making - that made a disaster out of the deal that she cut with the then biggest opposition party, the Democrats. Meanwhile, Japan looks likely to limp through its early 21st century Indian summer, at least through the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Considering what is happening in some countries in the west \u2013 of which Japan is arguably a part \u2013 it could be worse. Jun Okumura, visiting scholar at the Meiji Institute for Global Affairs Abe has no mandate - despite his landslide Because of faults in Japan\u2019s first past the post electoral system there is a huge gap between public opinion on key issues and the distribution of seats in the Diet. It\u2019s hard to say that Abe has a real mandate for constitutional reform, even though the LDP won by a landslide. With such a low turnout, it isn\u2019t as if the LDP and Abe enjoy huge public support. It is yet another case of the LDP benefiting from electoral system dysfunction and a divided opposition. The constitution is the most divisive issue \u2013 it\u2019s like Brexit in the UK. It\u2019s part of a global shift from interest-based politics \u2013 who gets what \u2013 to identity politics. In America, it\u2019s immigration and abortion, in Britain it\u2019s the EU and in Japan it\u2019s the constitution. Japanese people are being asked if they are happy with postwar liberal democracy or whether they want to revive an older Japan and its values. It\u2019s a deeply emotional issue, particularly for Abe. That\u2019s why he is talking about it, even though he already pushed through a law allowing Japan to engage in collective self-defence. Why else would he bother with the constitution, especially when there are more pressing issues such as the economy and ageing society? The coalition has the numbers in parliament, but it\u2019s safe to say that the public is at least very divided on constitutional reform. It is not clear at all that Abe would win a simple majority in a national referendum (a requirement to revise the constitution). As Brexit proved, incumbent governments don\u2019t necessarily get their way in referendums. Koichi Nakano, professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo No progress for women in this election The election caused a lot of excitement, with the main opposition Democratic Party effectively disbanding and the emergence of two new political parties. The other story, unfortunately common but one mostly unremarked upon, is the lack of progress for women\u2019s political representation. Male domination of politics in Japan is so normative and so long-standing that it is almost unremarkable. Yet, the fact that one of the world\u2019s most economically advanced countries with a relatively strong record on human rights and women\u2019s empowerment in health and education, comes last amongst OECD countries when it comes to political and economic empowerment, raises questions about democracy and equality. The long-ruling Liberal Democratic party\u2019s enduring grip on power and the low level of female political representation are not unrelated. A mere 8% of LDP candidates in Sunday\u2019s election were women. Women\u2019s groups have been campaigning for the introduction of gender quotas as a way of addressing the gender imbalance in politics for more than 20 years, and the LDP is more consistent than any other major party in its opposition to such measures. Indeed, a bill to encourage parties to implement internal gender quotas was effectively quashed, before having a chance to be voted on, when Shinzo Abe called the snap election. With the LDP in power again, increased attention to addressing this problem seems unlikely. Dr Emma Dalton, lecturer in Japanese at RMIT University in Melbourne",
