    "content": "North Korea \u201cis screwed up in every aspect\u201d, says Gunnar Garfors who, aged just 37, became the youngest \u201chobby traveller\u201d to visit every country in the world. \u201cStaying there too long will mess with your mind.\u201d For over a decade the Norwegian journalist has doggedly gained access to 198 countries \u2013 five more than the United Nations (UN) official tally, as he included Palestine, the Vatican, Kosovo, Western Sahara and Taiwan. As a hobby traveller, Garfors explains that he makes the trips in his spare time, and isn\u2019t paid to do so. He insists he doesn\u2019t have a lot of money, but has prioritised his globe-trotting over a \u201cwife, a car or a CD collection\u201d \u2013 though he has since written a book about his experiences. \u2018The Stans\u2019 Garfors developed a taste for adventure in 2004 after a trip through Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. He says he was enchanted by the former Soviet states of Central Asia and decided to tick off the three other \u201cStans\u201d before setting off for the rest of the world. \u201cTurkmenistan is number two on the crazy list,\u201d says Garfors. \u201cI could walk around more freely than in North Korea, but it was very apparent I was being watched.\u201d The country consistently sits at the bottom of global freedom rankings, in the company of North Korea and Eritrea. The equestrian-mad nation has recently started to open up to tourists who can visit the so-called \u201cdictator\u2019s disneyland\u201d in the capital, Ashgabat, which boasts a 20m statue of president Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov sitting astride a golden horse. The country\u2019s other attractions include a burning pit at \u201cthe door to hell\u201d in the Darvaza crater, and rarely seen stretches of the silk road, the region\u2019s ancient trade route. Africa\u2019s hermetic borders In contrast, Garfors described Eritrea as a \u201ctruly amazing country\u201d hindered by military conscription and a heavy-handed government \u2013 factors which are thought to contribute to the unprecedented exodus of up to 5,000 citizens every month. Gaining access wasn\u2019t easy. The first time he applied for a visa from the embassy in Stockholm he waited for six weeks before getting his passport back with a note: \u201cHellow! Your visa application rejected (sic).\u201d He tried again, this time including a note about \u201chow much I had heard about the country and why I wanted to visit\u201d. It worked, and he made the trip in 2012. But Garfors explains that Eritrea, now nicknamed \u201cAfrica\u2019s North Korea\u201d, wasn\u2019t the hardest country on the continent to access. Angola, also known for human rights abuses, was harder still. \u201cThey actually refused to return my passport because I made a mistake on the form,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was following instructions on a website that hadn\u2019t been updated since 2003.\u201d Eventually, passport back in hand, Garfors booked a flight that had a 13-hour layover in the capital Luanda: \u201cI walked from the airport and had breakfast in a bar that was playing soft porn, refused their offer to display something harder and walked back to the airport.\u201d He has since said that Angola is the hardest country to visit in Africa, closely followed by Eritrea and Equatorial Guinea. Thanks to his ambitious travels Garfors has become adept at negotiating with passport officials. \u201cI never fill [the forms] out wrong anymore,\u201d he says, before sharing a few other tricks of the trade. He explains that it\u2019s almost always easier to get a visa from a neighbouring country, which is how he got in to Equatorial Guinea. It\u2019s usually cheaper to travel overland, as he did with Turkmenistan, and \u201csometimes its just boils down to getting the right official.\u201d Jogging in North Korea Garfors developed his rules for what constitutes a \u201cproper travelling experience\u201d early on. \u201cI think you need a story to tell, you must have been outside your vehicle or train, or airport,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou also need to have had a conversation,\u201d he adds, lamenting associations like the exclusive Century Travelling Club, for people who\u2019ve been to 100 countries, but which allows its members to count layovers or very brief stops in their official tally. Garfors says that his travelling experiences challenge some common misconceptions about some of the world\u2019s most closed-off states. Getting into North Korea, for example, was not the incredible feat that some might expect, with its small but developed travel and tourism market. However, the regime left Garfors frustrated when he visited in 2009: \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy being told what to do and I don\u2019t like guided tours.\u201d. He did however manage to organise a run free from his tour guide. \u201cWe got him drunk on liquor the night before,\u201d and the man, hungover, sent the driver to watch over them in his place, Garfors explains. The driver, not a fitness pro, struggled to keep up with the Norwegian. Running along the Taedong river in Pyongyang, Garfors says he attracted \u201csurprised looks\u201d from locals as he raced solo along the bank. After all those miles travelled, Garfors almost found lasting love with a girl in neighbouring South Korea, but he explains it didn\u2019t quite work out. \u201cThe funny thing about South Korea is that they take wedding photos months before the wedding, so I have the photos, I\u2019m just not married.\u201d Check your privilege Another traveller to complete the complete world tally, former playboy editor Albert Podell, was recently accused of being culturally tone deaf after writing a piece for The Atlantic about the hardest places to visit. \u201cThere\u2019s a tragic irony here,\u201d wrote Nadine Ajaka, also for The Atlantic. \u201cAs Podell describes the incredible feat of entering places like Sudan and North Korea, for much of the world, the United States is one of the most difficult and expensive nations to get into.\u201d Garfors insists he recognises his privilege as the holder of a Norwegian passport, arguably one of the easiest in the world for foreign travel. He explains that one of the main takeaways from his adventures was that most people \u201chadn\u2019t even heard of this country of Norway, that we think is the centre of the universe.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t become more humble in that process, then there\u2019s something wrong with you.\u201d",
