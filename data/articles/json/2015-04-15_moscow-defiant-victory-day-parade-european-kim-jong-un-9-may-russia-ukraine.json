    "content": "About 16,000 soldiers, 200 armoured vehicles and 150 planes and helicopters will take part in a Moscow parade for Victory Day on 9 May, dubbed Russia\u2019s \u201cbiggest holiday\u201d by Vladimir Putin. This year marks 70 years since the allied victory in the second world war, and will be the last major anniversary of the conflict when significant numbers of veterans are still alive. Conspicuous by their absence, however, will be western politicians, who are staying away from the celebrations on Red Square in protest against Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine. Instead, a number of the world\u2019s most notorious autocrats will attend, including Kim Jong-un, who will be making his first foreign visit as leader of North Korea. A decade ago, for celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of victory, Putin hosted the US and French presidents George W Bush and Jacques Chirac as well as the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. This time, the high-profile attendees are the leaders of China and India, emphasising Russia\u2019s strengthening alliances with non-western states following western sanctions. The US will be represented by its ambassador in Moscow, John Tefft. The Foreign Office in London said there was no decision yet about who would represent Britain at the parade. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has come up with a compromise; she will miss the parade but will travel to Moscow on 10 May to lay a wreath at a war memorial. Most EU leaders will stay away altogether and Russia has reacted with irritation. Officials believe the US has pressured EU members to stay away. \u201cNobody in the west is even hiding that the whole issue of not coming to Russia is not based on what the population of Europe thinks about the issue, but is owing to extreme pressure from Washington,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the Guardian. \u201cEveryone seems to have forgotten that heads of state are there to reflect the interests of their own countries and people. No one has asked the European veterans of the second world war whether it is right to boycott those who lost hundreds of thousands of people while saving Europe from fascism.\u201d The European no-show will mean that Putin will spend his celebration of Russia\u2019s victory over nazism in the company of some of the world\u2019s most ruthless dictators. A quartet of central Asian despots have confirmed their attendance, including Uzbekistan\u2019s Islam Karimov and Turkmenistan\u2019s Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, both of whom have been criticised for appalling human rights abuses. But the guest who will attract the most attention, if he does turn up, is Kim. The 32-year-old took over after the death in December 2011 of his father, Kim Jong-il, who was scared of flying, and, on the rare occasions he visited Russia, travelled by train. But photographs recently surfaced of Kim Jr inside a private jet, suggesting he may fly to Moscow. Kim Yong-nam, the president of Pyongyang\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament, is technically the head of state, meaning that it is possible he may travel to Moscow instead. But Russian officials have indicated privately that they believe North Korea\u2019s supreme leader will attend. Details about his potential itinerary are currently unknown. If Kim does show, there will not be a rare meeting between the leaders of the two Koreas. The South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, has ruled out attending. An official said she would send an envoy to represent her. Russia\u2019s efforts to link victory in the war with events in Ukraine have left many in the west feeling even more uncomfortable about going to the lavish 9 May events in Moscow. Last year, Putin attended Victory Day celebrations in Moscow and Sevastopol, Crimea, flying to the newly annexed territory to address veterans, soldiers and sailors of the Black Sea fleet. He said Victory Day was \u201cour country\u2019s biggest holiday\u201d, adding that the veterans\u2019 defeat of the Nazis was an inspiration for Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea. \u201cVeterans, you set the example for us all, and you have made a tremendous moral contribution to the return of Crimea and Sevastopol to their native land. You have handed down to us the great values of unity, justice and togetherness and have taught us to act according to our conscience,\u201d Putin told the crowds in the Black Sea port. In east Ukraine, the supposed parallels between the second world war and the current conflict have been drawn even more explicitly. The orange and black Saint George\u2019s ribbon, widely used in Russia as a symbol of the Soviet victory, has been adopted as a separatist flag, while the new government in Kiev has been dismissed as \u201cfascists\u201d by Russian television. Russia has been particularly critical of the reverence among sections of Ukrainian society for the nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, whose movement collaborated with the Nazis towards the end of the war. In turn, Ukrainian leaders have compared modern Russia\u2019s actions and political system to the Nazis. \u201cToday we see not only attempts at distorting the events of the war, but also cynical lies and impudent defamation of an entire generation of people who gave up everything for this victory, who defended peace on earth,\u201d said Putin at a recent meeting of the committee organising the 9 May celebrations. \u201cTheir goal is obvious: to undermine Russia\u2019s power and moral authority \u2026 and to use historical speculations in their geopolitical games. At times, it sounds like downright ravings \u2013 it is amazing how people get these ideas.\u201d The victory has always been looked upon with some ambiguity in central Europe, where liberation was followed by Soviet occupation. One of the few EU heads of state to confirm their visit to Moscow on 9 May is the Czech president, Milo\u0161 Zeman. The US ambassador to the country, Andrew Schapiro, criticised the decision. Zeman retaliated, banning the envoy from official events and stating he, as president, was free to make his own choices. However, after widespread criticism from the Czech public and politicians, Zeman said he would still travel to Moscow but would not attend the parade. \u201cI think, after all the anti-Russian propaganda, nobody in Europe remembers for example that 140,000 Soviet soldiers died in the liberation of Czechoslovakia,\u201d said Zakharova. \u201cTaking into account the injured and missing, more than half a million people suffered. Now all this historical memory has been trampled on by Washington. It\u2019s a shame for Europeans, they have become lost.\u201d",
