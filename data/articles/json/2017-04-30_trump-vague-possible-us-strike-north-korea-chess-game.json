    "content": "As tensions between the US and North Korea continued on Sunday, Donald Trump said the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, was \u201ca pretty smart cookie\u201d for managing to hold on to power after taking over at a young age. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Is he sane?\u2019\u201d Trump said, in a wide-ranging interview on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, held to mark his 100th day in the White House. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks echoed those made controversially to Reuters earlier in the week, when he said: \u201cHe\u2019s 27 years old, his father dies, took over a regime, so say what you want but that\u2019s not easy, especially at that age.\u201d The president was speaking after Pope Francis made an appeal for third-party moderation to avoid \u201ca widespread war [that] would destroy \u2026 a good part of humanity\u201d. Pyongyang is widely thought to be seeking a viable missile delivery system for a nuclear weapon, prompting military and diplomatic pressure from Washington. On Friday night it launched its ninth missile test in 100 days of the Trump administration. Like others, the test failed. \u201cPerhaps they\u2019re just not very good missiles,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut eventually, he\u2019ll have good missiles.\u201d Asked about the chance of a US strike, Trump left the possibility open. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be announcing all our moves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a chess game. I just don\u2019t want people to know what my thinking is. So eventually, he will have a better delivery system. And if that happens, we can\u2019t allow it to happen.\u201d The US national security adviser, HR McMaster, told Fox News Sunday that though the missile launches represented a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to the US, its Asian allies and China, North Korea\u2019s chief backer, \u201cwhat we prefer to do is to work with others, China included, to resolve this situation short of military action\u201d. That meant enforcing United Nations sanctions and perhaps \u201cratcheting up those sanctions even further\u201d, McMaster said. \u201cAnd it also means being prepared for military operations if necessary.\u201d Trump praised his own diplomatic contact with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who visited the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida this month. \u201cThe relationship I have with China,\u201d Trump said, \u201cit\u2019s been already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we\u2019ve ever had. But again, you know, we\u2019ll find out whether or not President Xi is able to effect change.\u201d The White House also faced criticism over a related diplomatic effort, a Saturday call between Trump and Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines. Duterte is accused by human rights group of overseeing a brutal anti-drugs campaign in which as many as 7,000 people may have been killed by police and vigilante groups. The White House readout of the \u201cvery friendly\u201d call said Trump praised Duterte\u2019s efforts against the drugs trade and invited him to visit the White House. Pressed on Duterte\u2019s human rights record on ABC\u2019s This Week, the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said: \u201cThe purpose of this call, is all about North Korea.\u201d He added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that human rights don\u2019t matter, but what it does mean is that the issues facing us developing out of North Korea are so serious that we need cooperation at some level with as many partners in the area as we can get to make sure we have our ducks in a row.\u201d Priebus added that Trump would speak with leaders of Singapore and Thailand on Sunday, prompted by the \u201cpotential for nuclear and massive destruction in Asia\u201d. Later, an official speaking on condition of anonymity told Reuters the conversations concerned \u201cways to maintain diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea\u201d. Separately, South Korea said McMaster had confirmed the US would not be seeking payment for the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) that is being installed in the south of the country. Trump said last week that he would make South Korea, an ally, pay $1bn. The South Korean defense ministry has said that under an agreement reached during the Obama administration, South Korea offers the land and facilities for Thaad but does not cover the cost of operations. On Sunday, Thaad sites in South Korea saw protests from local residents, concerned North Korea might target such sites if war breaks out. In an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Vice-President Mike Pence said Trump would \u201ccontinue to call on the prosperous nations that the United States provides security and protection for to do more in their own defense\u201d. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Senator John McCain was asked about McMaster\u2019s apparent correction of his president on such a sensitive issue. Trump, McCain said, had \u201csurrounded himself with an outstanding national security team\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee to world leaders that he will always listen to [that team] but he has so far,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s important to watch what the president does rather than what he says.\u201d",
