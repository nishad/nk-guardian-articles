    "content": "The UN security council has imposed sanctions on 18 North Korean officials and entities as the United States vowed to respond to Pyongyang\u2019s missile and nuclear tests \u201cthrough other means, if necessary.\u201d The council on Friday unanimously adopted a US-drafted resolution that put North Korea\u2019s suspected spy chief, 13 other officials and four entities on the UN sanctions blacklist, hitting them with a global travel ban and an assets freeze. \u201cThe security council is sending a clear message to North Korea today: stop firing ballistic missiles or face the consequences,\u201d US ambassador Nikki Haley told the council. \u201cBeyond diplomatic and financial consequences, the United States remains prepared to counteract North Korean aggression through other means, if necessary,\u201d she added. China backed the sanctions but renewed its appeal for dialogue to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. Chinese ambassador Liu Jieyi described current situation as \u201ccomplex and sensitive\u201d but added that there was \u201ca critical window of opportunity\u201d to return to \u201cthe right track of seeking a settlement through dialogue and negotiations.\u201d \u201cIt is incumbent on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and do more to ease tension and build mutual trust, instead of the contrary,\u201d Liu added. Among those added to the sanctions blacklist was Cho Il-U, believed to be the head of foreign espionage for Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime. The other 13 included senior officials from North Korea\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party and heads of trading firms tasked with securing purchases for Pyongyang\u2019s military programs. The strategic rocket force of the North Korean army, two trading firms and the Koryo Bank \u2013linked to a party office that manages Kim\u2019s finances \u2013 also had their assets frozen. The resolution however did not contain some of the stronger sanctions that the US administration had floated last month, such as an oil embargo, a ban on maritime shipping, trade restrictions and curbs on North Korean workers abroad. The 18 names will be added to the current blacklist of 39 individuals and 42 North Korean entities subject under UN sanctions. North Korea has carried out two atomic tests and dozens of missile launches since the beginning of last year in its quest to develop a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the continental United States. For weeks, the United States has been negotiating with China on new measures to ratchet up the pressure on North Korea but Beijing has insisted on the need to open up dialogue. The United States has said it is willing to talk to North Korea if it halts its missile and nuclear tests. French ambassador Francois Delattre said the resolution served as \u201ca warning\u201d to North Korea of tougher sanctions to come unless it changes course and halts its tests. \u201cIf it continues on this dangerous path, we will have no other choice but to reinforce the pressure, again and again,\u201d Delattre said. The security council adopted two sanctions resolutions last year to ramp up pressure on Pyongyang and deny Kim the hard currency needed to fund his military programs. Those resolutions significantly curbed North Korea\u2019s coal exports, a major source of revenue, implemented restrictions on banking and mandatory searches of all cargo to and from North Korea. The latest resolution condemned \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons activities and demanded that Pyongyang abandon all of its military programs.",
