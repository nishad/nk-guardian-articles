    "content": "Tensions between North and South Korea are at a high, as the US and Seoul brace themselves for a missile test. There is a history of flare-ups in the area: two South Korean marines died in 2010 after North Korea fired shells at the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong. South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff said 16 others were injured during the bombardment of the island, which is located near the countries' disputed western border. This is obviously not the first time this has happened - there have been over 150 incidents since the Korean War in 1950, that we know about. The reason we do know about these is because of an exhaustive report by the Congressional Research Service, published in 2007. It covers every incident, from diplomatic hostilities, through to the more serious events where people have died. Some of these events have occured around the world. We wanted to map those events, using Google Fusion tables - and that's what you can see above. There are some hefty caveats here. Where we didn't know the precise location, we have made an educated guess, based on reports and the location details we do have. The other thing worth noting is that this was compiled in the US - a report compiled in Pyongyang would look very very different. This is just a starting point. What can you add to the data?
