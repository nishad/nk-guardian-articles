    "content": "Malcolm Turnbull said \u201cnobody\u201d at the G20 table was defending North Korea\u2019s latest missile test, including China, despite the group\u2019s failure to produce a unanimous statement condemning the rogue state. Speaking in Paris on Sunday, Turnbull said he had hoped to see the G20 deliver a statement on North Korea. He said it simply \u201cwas not able to be achieved\u201d. \u201cI just want to be very clear about this, nobody around that table was defending the North Koreans, in terms of their conduct,\u201d Turnbull told reporters. \u201cIt is the Chinese of course, as I\u2019ve said before, who have the greatest leverage and hence the greatest responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201c[They] are very forthright in their condemnation of North Korea\u2019s conduct, and indeed in supporting the sanctions that have been imposed by the security council.\u201d The failure to deliver a unanimous statement on North Korea was seen by some commentators as a sign of waning US influence. In analysis that has gone viral, ABC political editor Chris Uhlmann, described it as a consequence of Donald Trump\u2019s poor leadership. But Turnbull maintained the United States, through Trump\u2019s presence in Hamburg, continued to demonstrate global leadership. \u201cThe US is a global leader, plainly,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cIt is the largest economy, it is the number one superpower. It provides global leadership and the president\u2019s presence at Hamburg was demonstration of that. \u201cBut again that doesn\u2019t mean that everybody has to agree on every single point.\u201d The most glaring area of difference at the meeting\u2019s conclusion was on climate change. Nineteen of the 20 countries recommitted to the Paris climate change accord, leaving only the US in the cold. That prompted a communique from the G20, which read: \u201cWe take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris agreement,\u201d adding: \u201cThe leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris agreement is irreversible\u201d and \u201cwe reaffirm our strong commitment to the Paris agreement\u201d. Turnbull said progress on climate change had been made at the G20, despite the US position. \u201cPlainly there are some differences of opinion around the table, but you can have a good outcome \u2026 without having unanimity on every single point,\u201d Turnbull said. Turnbull said Australia had sought and achieved agreements on terror and \u201cchallenges in the cyber sphere\u201d.",
