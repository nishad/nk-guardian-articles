    "content": "On Friday afternoon, the eve of North Korea\u2019s most powerful ever nuclear test, China\u2019s football-loving president received a gift from the world\u2019s greatest ever player. \u201cGood luck,\u201d read the handwritten message from Pel\u00e9 on a canary yellow Brazil jersey handed to Xi Jinping by his South American counterpart, Michel Temer. Xi needs it. Experts say Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest provocation \u2013 which some believe was deliberately timed to upstage the start of the annual Brics summit in China \u2013 exposes not only the scale of the North Korean challenge now facing China\u2019s president but also his dearth of options. \u201cThe Chinese are pissed off, quite frankly,\u201d says Steve Tsang, the head of the Soas China Institute. \u201cBut there is nothing much they will actually do about it. Words? UN statements and all that? Yes. But what can the Chinese actually do?\u201d Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert from the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, believes there are a number of possible answers. Sanctions or turning off the taps The first is to further tighten sanctions on Kim\u2019s regime by targeting its exports of textiles and clothing. \u201cAfter the last round of UN resolution sanctions, textile products and clothing is now the most important source of foreign income for North Korea,\u201d says Zhao. Xi could also deprive Kim of another key source of revenue by agreeing to limit or completely prohibit up to 100,000 North Korean labourers from working overseas, including in China. A third and far more drastic option also exists: cutting off North Korea\u2019s crude oil supply. \u201cThis nuclear test is one of the few things that might trigger a cut-off of oil supplies, but we are still very reluctant to do so,\u201d one person close to Chinese foreign policymakers told the Financial Times after Sunday\u2019s detonation. Zhao doubts Xi will choose that risk-strewn path. He believes turning off the taps could prove an irreversible decision since the pipeline delivering oil to North Korea is old and would corrode and break if left unused. Crucially, though, it would cripple North Korea\u2019s economy, almost certainly bring down Kim\u2019s regime and create a massive refugee and security crisis just a few hundred miles from Beijing. \u201cThat is one of the most radical measures China could ever take and it could have strategic implications if the regime\u2019s stability is affected,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cIt is not going to be immediate but over time it could have an impact on the regime\u2019s survival.\u201d Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert from Renmin University in Beijing, also admits tightened sanctions are the only feasible response: \u201cChina has been pushed into a corner and has few options left.\u201d Growing frustration That said, some believe appetite is growing in China for a more robust response to Kim Jong-un\u2019s continued provocations. \u201cThis is an insane country, and he is an insane leader,\u201d says Zhu Feng, an international security expert from Nanjing University. \u201cWe are now at a historic turning point and \u2013 from my point of view \u2013 China needs to strengthen coordination and cooperation with the international community, particularly with the US, Japan and South Korea.\u201d \u201cI think the domestic discussions about cutting crude oil supply are increasing,\u201d says Zhao, who thinks the mood in China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s key ally and trading partner \u2013 may be starting to shift. Zhao believes Xi\u2019s ability to take tougher action against Kim partly hinges partly on how much he can strengthen his political position ahead of next month\u2019s 19th Communist party congress, a once-every-five-years conference marking the end of his first term in power. Recent weeks have seen tantalising glimpses of the internal power struggle that is raging at the top of China\u2019s Communist party, with the purging of one senior official tipped as Xi\u2019s possible successor and a major reshuffle in the leadership of the armed forces. \u201cIf things settle down very quickly \u2026 that will give Xi Jinping some leeway to take more radical measures against North Korea,\u201d Zhao predicts. \u201cBut if domestic politics continues to play out until the 19th party congress, then I don\u2019t think China has any room to take radical measures.\u201d Smart cookie and the wildcard Tsang believes the apparent lack of effective options to halt Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear ambitions underlines what a shrewd strategtist he is and how successfully he was toying with both China and the US: \u201cHe is a smart cookie \u2013 a very, very smart cookie.\u201d As long as China was not a direct target of North Korean aggression, Xi would view Kim as an irritant rather than a threat that needed to be immediately crushed: \u201cAt the moment nobody seriously sees the North Korean missiles and nuclear weapons as a threat to China ... The most likely target would be the Japanese. Now how unhappy would Xi be with the prospect of ... the Abe administration being blasted to pieces? Neither outcome would actually make Xi lose any sleep.\u201d But for both Kim and Xi, there is one wild-card and he goes by the name of Donald J Trump. Tsang says conventional military advice suggests the US president would not risk a military strike against North Korea for fear of sparking a devastating counter-attack against South Korea and a broader regional conflagration that would inevitably suck in China. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 10,000 different pieces of [North Korean] artillery ... which could lob shells into the vicinity of Seoul and cause huge damage,\u201d said Tsang. \u201cSo Kim\u2019s reasonable calculation is that there is not actually a lot that Trump can do about it and there is almost certainly nothing the Chinese will do about it in concrete terms.\u201d Trump, however, was no conventional president. \u201cThe problem is somebody like Trump does not behave necessarily in line with your normal Obama and Clintons of this world and therefore the risk of him ignoring professional military advice is not negligible,\u201d says Tsang. \u201cIt would be negligible under Obama and extremely unlikely under Clinton or, for that matter, probably even George W Bush. But we can\u2019t say the same of Trump. That\u2019s one thing about Mr Trump, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Additional reporting by Wang Zhen",
