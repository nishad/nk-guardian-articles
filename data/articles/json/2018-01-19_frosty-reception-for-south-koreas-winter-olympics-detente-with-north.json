    "content": "South Korea is facing a public backlash over its sports rapprochement with North Korea, with critics accusing the government of turning next month\u2019s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics into the \u201cPyongyang Olympics\u201d. After three high-level meetings along their border in little over a week, North and South Korea have proposed forming a joint women\u2019s ice hockey team and allowing their athletes to march together under one flag at next month\u2019s games in South Korea. Despite the logistical challenges posed by North Korea\u2019s eleventh-hour agreement to compete in Pyeongchang, the International Olympic Committee is expected to give the proposal a sympathetic hearing when it meets officials from both countries in Lausanne on Saturday. But young people and conservatives in South Korea have accused the country\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, of sacrificing Olympic ideals for diplomatic expediency. Moon\u2019s approval rating fell to a four-month low of 67% on Friday, in a reflection of the public\u2019s lukewarm response to his attempts to promote an Olympic d\u00e9tente he hopes will lead to a diplomatic breakthrough over Pyongyang\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes. Moon\u2019s approval rating among people in their 20s and 30s \u2013 his core support \u2013 fell to 75% and 82% respectively, down six percentage points and seven percentage points from last week. \u201cNorth Korea was all about firing missiles last year, but suddenly they want to come to the South for the Olympics? Who gets to decide that?,\u201d said Kim Joo-hee, a 24-year-old Seoul resident. \u201cDoes North Korea have so much privilege to do whatever they want?\u201d Conservative politicians voiced anger over a proposal to have the country\u2019s athletes march with their North Korean counterparts under a unification flag rather than the South Korean flag. \u201cWe are turning the Pyeongchang Olympics that we\u2019ve got into the Pyongyang Olympics,\u201d said Hong Joon-pyo, leader of South Korea\u2019s main conservative opposition party, adding that Seoul was now \u201cdancing to the tune\u201d of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Moon countered that North Korea\u2019s participation at Pyeongchang \u201cwill serve as a chance to warm solidly frozen South-North ties.\u201d He added: \u201cIf we march together or field a single team, I think that can be a further step in developing South-North relations.\u201d While the overall number of North Korean athletes has yet to be decided, the existing South Korean ice hockey squad of 22 players will have to be expanded, possibly to 35, to accommodate them \u2013 an arrangement criticised by their Canadian coach, Sarah Murray. \u201cAdding somebody so close to the Olympics is a little bit dangerous just for team chemistry because the girls have been together for so long,\u201d Murray said. Ice hockey officials in Switzerland, who face South Korea in their opening match, said the expected late addition of North Korean players was \u201cnot fair and distorts competition\u201d. South Korean government officials have also been forced to defend the planned use of North Korea\u2019s Masikryong ski resort as a training base, after critics said it would generate publicity for one of Kim Jong-un\u2019s pet projects.
