    "content": "Donald Trump has revived US relations with two of Asia\u2019s most authoritarian heads of state \u2013 the leader of Thailand\u2019s junta and the president of the Philippines \u2013 by inviting them to the White House. In separate phone calls over the weekend, Trump spoke with Thailand\u2019s prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former general who took power in a 2014 coup, and Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte, who is accused of mass murder. The calls aimed to rally regional allies as Washington takes an increasingly hard line towards North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme. Pyongyang ran another failed missile test on Friday. The governments of Thailand and the Philippines had cooperative but strained relationships with the US before Trump took office, mostly because of human rights concerns expressed by the former administration. Neither leader was offered an official White House visit during Barack Obama\u2019s tenur, although Prayuth did attend a summit in California. Obama cancelled a meeting with Duterte after the Filipino strongman referred to him as a \u201cson of a whore\u201d. Asked on Monday about his invitation from Trump, Duterte was non-committal, telling reporters: \u201cI\u2019m tied up. I cannot make any definite promise. I am supposed to go to Russia and go to Israel.\u201d Thailand\u2019s deputy government spokesman, Lt Gen Werachon Sukondhapatipak, did not mention North Korea but said \u201c[the US and Thailand] stand ready to enhance bilateral cooperation in all dimensions\u201d. Bangkok\u2019s ruling generals have promised elections yet repeatedly delayed a vague deadline for a return to democratic rule, now tentatively tabled for late 2018.With Prayuth as prime minister, politicians and activists have been detained as part of a countrywide clampdown. The launch of an Amnesty International report on torture in jails last year was blocked by police. In Manila, Duterte has used his first 10 months in office to conduct a devastating crackdown on crime in which thousands of suspected drug dealers and alleged addicts have died. More than 7,000 people have been killed by police and vigilantes. Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch\u2019s deputy director for Asia, said: \u201cCountries with close bilateral ties to the Philippines, particularly the United States, have an obligation to urge accountability for the victims of Duterte\u2019s abusive drug war, rather than offer to roll out the red carpet for official state visits with its mastermind.\u201d Kine said Duterte was an \u201centhusiastic cheerleader\u201d for thousands of extrajudicial killings, adding: \u201cHe has made repeated calls for the public to kill drug addicts as part of his anti-drug campaign.\u201d Last week, a Filipino lawyer filed a complaint at the international criminal court accusing Duterte and 11 officials of mass murder and crimes against humanity. The 77-page complaint alleged the president had \u201crepeatedly, unchangingly and continuously\u201d committed extrajudicial executions or mass murders over three decades, amounting to crimes against humanity. Duterte\u2019s aides have denied the allegations. The White House said the discussion with Duterte was \u201cvery friendly\u201d and Trump specifically praised his deadly campaign, saying the Philippine president was \u201cfighting very hard to rid his country of drugs\u201d. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, twice refused in an interview to say whether Trump had raised human rights concerns. \u201cObviously, we want to encourage [Duterte] to do better. But this call, the purpose of this call, is all about North Korea,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cNow if we don\u2019t have all of our folks together, whether they\u2019re good folks, bad folks, people that we wish would do better in their country, doesn\u2019t matter. We have got to be on the same page,\u201d he said. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Monday: \u201cI think it is an opportunity for us to work with countries in that region that can help play a role in diplomatically and economically isolating North Korea. And frankly, the national interests of the United States, the safety of our people and the safety of people in the region are the number one priorities of the president.\u201d Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, questioned Trump\u2019s motives for inviting Duterte, saying Manila had no leverage over Pyongyang. Trump has a potential conflict of interest in the Philippines as his family brand is due to open a skyscraper in Manila. The Filipino developer Jose EB Antonio was named as \u201cspecial trade envoy\u201d to the US last year, making the US president\u2019s family and a Philippine government official business partners. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and assistant, has been the face of promotional material for the building. Trump told CBS that the threat of a North Korean nuclear strike was more important than other foreign policy objectives in Asia, including a trade deal with China. \u201cTrade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade,\u201d he said. Duterte, an anti-establishment candidate who rode a wave of populism to overthrow the country\u2019s major political players, has sometimes been labelled the \u201cTrump of Asia\u201d. However, he has also referred to Trump as a bigot. Since taking office in January, Trump has expressed admiration for many of the world\u2019s most prominent authoritarians. He was the first western leader to congratulate Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan for his victory in a controversial referendum that handed the Turkish president vast powers. Trump also welcomed Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to the White House, despite the Egyptian president\u2019s crackdown on Islamists, journalists and dissidents. Spicer insisted it was a question of priorities. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that the president talks to these leaders in private about, and I think you saw that case in Egypt where sometimes that kind of diplomacy, privately talking about them, building a relationship, can achieve results not just for our people but for their people, and discussing the human rights issues,\u201d he said. It would be a mistake to assume \u201cbecause we don\u2019t put out a statement publicly chastising leaders at every call\u201d that the president is not concerned about ethical questions, he added. \u201cI think the president understands the value but he understands the balance, and the reason that the president is building an effective coalition and is getting results around the globe and reasserting America\u2019s place is because he understands the type of diplomacy and the type of negotiating and the type of deal making that actually gets real results from our country.\u201d Trump will visit Asia for two regional summits, in Vietnam and the Philippines, towards the end of the year. Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, was also given a White House invitation over the weekend. Additional reporting by David Smith in Washington",
