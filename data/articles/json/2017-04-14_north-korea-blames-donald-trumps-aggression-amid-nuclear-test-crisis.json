    "content": "China has urged the US and North Korea to step back from the brink of a potentially catastrophic conflict after Pyongyang warned it would not \u201ckeep its arms crossed\u201d in the event of a pre-emptive strike. Speaking in Beijing on Friday, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, told reporters the region faced a \u201cprecarious situation\u201d in which \u201cone has the feeling that a conflict could break out at any moment\u201d. He made his plea before an anticipated sixth North Korean nuclear test on Saturday to mark the birth of the country\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung. \u201cWe call on all parties to refrain from provoking and threatening each other, whether in words or actions, and not to let the situation get to an irreversible and unmanageable stage,\u201d Wang said, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency. \u201cIf a war occurs, the result is a situation in which everybody loses and there can be no winner. It is not the one who espouses harsher rhetoric or raises a bigger fist that will win.\u201d North Korea\u2019s vice-foreign minister, Han Song-ryol, earlier warned it would not \u201ckeep its arms crossed\u201d in the event of a pre-emptive US strike and would conduct a nuclear test when it saw fit. Han told the Associated Press in an interview in Pyongyang that Donald Trump\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d tweets aimed at the regime were \u201ccausing trouble\u201d, adding that the mounting crisis on the peninsula was locked in a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d. Experts believe Pyongyang could defy Trump by carrying out a missile launch or nuclear test to coincide with the so-called Day of the Sun on 15 April, commemorating the birth of the country\u2019s founder. Satellite imagery has revealed signs of preparations for a possible nuclear test in a new tunnel complex at the Punggye-ri military site. Scores of foreign reporters have been allowed into Pyongyang to cover celebrations to mark the 105th anniversary of Kim Il-sung\u2019s birth, but they have not been granted access to military-related areas. Some North Korea specialists played down expectations of a test, however, saying the regime was more likely to use the military parade in Pyongyang to showcase a new long-range missile it is developing. The US vice president, Mike Pence, is due to fly to South Korea on Sunday, in what the White House said was a show of support for its regional ally. Aides said there were contingency plans for trip in case North Korea carries out a nuclear test. On Thursday evening, NBC News cited intelligence officials as saying the US could carry out a pre-emptive conventional strike if it got intelligence that the North Koreans were about to test, but that was strongly denied by Pentagon officials. However, administration officials repeated on Friday that military options were under active consideration in the search for containing Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear aspirations. Speaking in advance of Pence\u2019s trip, a senior official said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got some military options already being assessed, but we\u2019ll work that as we sit down in discussions with General Brooks, the commander there on Peninsula.\u201d \u201c[Kim] continues to develop this program,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe continues to launch missiles into the Sea of Japan. So with that regime it\u2019s not a matter of \u201cif,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cwhen.\u201d So we\u2019re well prepared to counter that.\u201d Writing in the Global Times, a Communist party-controlled tabloid, one Chinese scholar urged Trump against carrying out a Syria-style bombing campaign against North Korea. \u201cNorth Korea is not Syria. It may have the ability to strike South Korea and Japan with nuclear weapons,\u201d said Li Jiacheng, a fellow at Liaoning University in north-eastern China. \u201cIf the US makes a pre-emptive strike on North Korea, Pyongyang will attack South Korea, Japan and the US forces stationed in the two countries,\u201d Li warned. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the war will not be a blitz but a protracted one, which will require a lot of energy from the countries involved.\u201d \u201cIn the current situation, [the] possibility is still low that the US will initiate a war on the peninsula,\u201d Li added. \u201cHowever, because of Trump\u2019s unpredictability, it is difficult to predict his policy toward the region.\u201d On Thursday, Trump, who has previously accused Beijing of failing to rein in its North Korean ally, said he believed China was prepared to act. \u201cI have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the US, with its allies, will!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. However, despite signs of warming ties between the US and China, experts doubt the relationship is sufficiently sturdy for definitive collaboration on North Korea. Steven Weber, an international relations specialist from the University of California, Berkeley, said: \u201cIf you want regime change in North Korea then you have got to have a plan for how to manage that on the other side of the collapse \u2013 and that requires a long-term collaborative relationship between the Americans and the Chinese to make sure that whatever happens, and however that reconstruction emerges, is acceptable to both sides.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we are anywhere near a place right now where either side trusts the other to a depth that you believe that you could sustain and maintain that kind of relationship for that long a period of time.\u201d The rise in tensions came ahead of the arrival in South Korea on Sunday of the US vice-president, Mike Pence, who will also visit Japan, Washington\u2019s other key ally in the region, early next week. Previewing Pence\u2019s trip, a White House foreign policy adviser said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to consult with the Republic of Korea on North Korea\u2019s efforts to advance its ballistic missile and its nuclear programme.\u201d Seoul and Tokyo are considered at greatest risk of a North Korean counterattack in the event of a pre-emptive strike by the US. On Thursday, Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, warned that North Korea may be capable of attacking the country with a missile loaded with sarin nerve gas \u2013 the same substance used in a deadly attack on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese doomsday cult in 1995. North Korea appears to have resumed the use of cold war scare tactics with the radio broadcast of indecipherable code that could be used to communicate with its spies in the South. Radio broadcasts containing a combination of mysterious random numbers were picked up in South Korea on Friday, according to Yonhap news agency. Some experts in South Korea said the use of radio broadcasts \u2013 a common means of issuing orders to agents during the cold war \u2013 was outmoded and could instead be intended to raise tensions. The state-run Pyongyang Radio began broadcasting the messages early on Friday, with an announcer reading out a series of numbers and page numbers. The radio announcer referred to the numbers as \u201creview works in elementary information technology lessons of the remote education university for No 27 expedition agents\u201d, according to Yonhap. North Korea ended broadcasts of encrypted numbers after tensions with South Korea eased following a historic inter-Korea summit in 2000. Their resumption last June is seen as a reflection of how far relations have deteriorated. Yonhap said Pyongyang Radio had made 32 such broadcasts since June last year, most recently last weekend. With agents based in the South now able to communicate with their handlers via the internet, the use of numbers, which they would then decipher using a reference book, appears outdated.",
