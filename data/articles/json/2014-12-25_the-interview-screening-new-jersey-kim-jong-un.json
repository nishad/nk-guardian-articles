    "content": "The Empire Columbia Park 12 cinema, in North Bergen, New Jersey, had already pre-sold almost a third of its tickets for its 11.40am showing of The Interview \u2013 an unprecedented number for a holiday morning. They\u2019re expecting a packed house. Outside, Alex Vasquez, a 19-year-old from nearby Jersey City, New Jersey, told the Guardian he\u2019s come to see the movie to support freedom of speech. \u201cBecause we can show Kim Jong-un that we\u2019re Americans \u2013 we can still release something. We don\u2019t take orders from him.\u201d He was wearing a jacket covered in patches, and a t-shirt from the metal band Enslaved. \u201cLand of the free, home of the brave,\u201d he added. Vasquez says he was tempted to watch the movie on Wednesday, when it was released online, but decided to save it until Thursday. The cinema\u2019s security guard said he\u2019d been warned that \u201cthe North Korean film\u201d is showing today, and is on high alert for trouble. But Vasquez was not scared by hackers\u2019 threats. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bunch of talk.\u201d Takuya Katsumura was outside too, interviewing people for Japanese TV network Nippon TV. He says that he and his crew went up to a cinema in Yonkers, up the Hudson Valley from New York City, at midnight Wednesday night for a rumoured showing at a cinema there. Lots of other networks had the same idea \u2013 \u201cABC, NBC, Fox,\u201d Katsumura said \u2013 but as it turned out they were disappointed. The midnight showing isn\u2019t until Thursday. The first people to arrive at the cinema, however, seemed bemused by the media attention. A young couple, they told the Guardian that they\u2019re here to see Night at the Museum. Asked if they were aware of the threats made against The Interview, the guy smiled and lifted his T-shirt to show a New Jersey police badge. \u201cIf there\u2019s any trouble,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d",
