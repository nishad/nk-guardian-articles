    "content": "An \u201cantsy and bored\u201d Donald Trump reportedly attempted to bring his summit with Kim Jong-un of North Korea forward by a day, asking aides after his arrival in Singapore last Sunday: \u201cWe\u2019re here now. Why can\u2019t we just do it?\u201d The one-day summit, aimed at reducing the threat from nuclear-armed North Korea, went ahead as planned on Tuesday. But on Thursday night, citing two people \u201cfamiliar with preparations for the event\u201d, the Washington Post said the president\u2019s impatience and a \u201ctense\u201d staff meeting with North Korean officials left \u201cleft some aides fearful that the entire summit might be in peril\u201d. In a Friday morning interview on the White House lawn with Fox &amp; Friends, meanwhile, Trump risked provoking critics when he said the North Korean dictator was \u201cthe strong head\u201d of his country. \u201cHe speaks and his people sit up at attention,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want my people to do the same.\u201d The president also claimed his predecessor in the White House, Barack Obama, had been \u201cessentially ready to go to war with North Korea\u201d, and claimed to have \u201csolved\u201d the problem of the nuclear threat from Pyongyang. The Post cited \u201cpeople familiar with the talks\u201d in reporting how Trump\u2019s request to move the summit was parried by senior members of his administration. \u201cUltimately,\u201d the Post wrote, \u201cSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders persuaded Trump to stick with the original plan, arguing that the president and his team could use the time to prepare.\u201d \u201cThey also,\u201d the report said, \u201cwarned him that he might sacrifice wall-to-wall television coverage of his summit if he abruptly moved the long-planned date to Monday in Singapore, which would be Sunday night in the United States.\u201d On Friday Trump\u2019s remarks \u2013 and a video statement issued later \u2013 had to compete for TV attention with the president\u2019s fierce criticism of a Department of Justice report, the FBI and its former director James Comey; the jailing of his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort; and the president\u2019s announcement of tariffs against China, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. Trump\u2019s preparation for the meeting with Kim was long a point of contention. In May, after North Korea criticised his vice-president, Mike Pence, Trump said the summit was cancelled. He later said his approach was not about preparation but \u201cabout attitude\u201d, then told a press conference in Canada he would know \u201cwithin the first minute\u201d if the summit would be a success. After meeting Kim, he told reporters he and the dictator \u201cgot to know each other well in a very confined period of time\u201d. The Trump-Kim summit has been widely criticised in the US, in most part for the failure to secure written commitment to North Korean denuclearisation, which the Trump administration has repeatedly demanded. Trump told Fox on Friday \u201cit\u2019s in the agreement, it says \u2018he will denuclearise\u2019\u201d after a summit from which \u201cwe get everything\u201d. Sanctions on North Korea would be \u201coff when we\u2019re sure there\u2019s no more nuclear\u201d, he said. In fact, the agreement says only that North Korea \u201ccommits to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d. Pompeo this week angrily told reporters the signed agreement did not contain all that was agreed in Singapore. In his video statement on Friday, Trump insisted: \u201cThis is the beginning of the process towards denuclearisation of North Korea. \u201cI sometimes say, \u2018the de-nuking of North Korea\u2019 and those are beautiful words\u201d. In Singapore, Trump also signalled a major concession to Pyongyang when he said he would cancel US-South Korean military exercises \u2013 to the surprise of South Korea and the US defense department. The Post report also said Trump laughingly praised North Korean state TV, joking \u201cthat even \u2026 Fox News was not as lavish in its praise\u201d. Footage of the president saluting a North Korean general has also been widely criticised, as has Trump\u2019s apparent dismissal of human rights concerns. The president repeatedly praised the North Korean leader for being \u201ctough\u201d. Trump told Fox on Friday: \u201cHe\u2019s the head of a country, he\u2019s the strong head, don\u2019t let anyone think anything different. He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.\u201d He later told a reporter he had been \u201ckidding\u201d. The reporter didn\u2019t \u201cunderstand sarcasm\u201d, he said. Speaking to Fox, Trump also said: \u201cWhen I was talking to President Obama, he was essentially ready to go to war with North Korea. I did ask him: \u2018Have you spoken to him?\u2019 He goes: \u2018No.\u2019 I said: \u2018You think it would be a good idea to speak to him, maybe? OK?\u2019\u201d Speaking to reporters, Trump said Obama told him North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons were the \u201cmost dangerous problem\u201d facing the US. \u201cI have solved that problem,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow we\u2019re getting it memorialized and all but that problem is largely solved.\u201d He also said he had given Kim \u201ca very direct number\u201d which meant the dictator could \u201ccall me if he has any difficulty\u201d. \u201cPeople are shocked,\u201d the president said, boasting about talks that followed abuse and threats between Washington and Pyongyang. \u201cThey thought Trump was going to get in, he\u2019s going to start throwing bombs all over the place. It\u2019s actually the opposite.\u201d Asked about his reluctance to criticise Kim\u2019s human rights record, he said: \u201cYou know why? Because I don\u2019t want to see a nuclear weapon to destroy you and your family.\u201d Trump also told Fox of his request for the return of remains of \u201cprobably 7,500\u201d US soldiers killed in the Korean war, which he claimed was already producing results. He said again that \u201cparents\u201d of such soldiers had appealed to him. The Korean war took place between 1950 and 1953, which would make the survival of any parents of soldiers killed in the war highly unlikely.",
