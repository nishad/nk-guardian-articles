    "content": "North Korea\u2019s provocative launch of a missile over Japanese territory is a brutal reminder of Japan\u2019s strategic vulnerability and the limited options for its prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in combating the growing nuclear and ballistic threat from Pyongyang. Abe\u2019s characterisation of the launch as an \u201cunprecedentedly grave and serious threat\u201d captures both the tension of the situation and the intense irritation and frustration of the Japanese government. For the Japanese public, who have only twice before (in 1998 and 2009) had to confront the deeply unsettling experience of North Korean missiles overflying their territory, the latest threat ratchets up the sense of anxiety. In recent weeks, the Abe administration has warned of missiles carrying chemical weapons striking Japanese cities, and issued civil defence and evacuation guidelines to local authorities. To ordinary Japanese, North Korea represents a clear and present danger and an implacable and unpredictable adversary \u2013 a threat underlined not only by its expanding WMD capability but also by Pyongyang\u2019s role in the 1970s and 80s in abducting scores of Japanese civilians and then refusing to reveal their fate. Fear of the North will intensify the pressure on Abe as he faces a sharp slump in his domestic approval ratings following a series of damaging corruption scandals. Yet there are limits to what he can do. Japan is a staunch backer of the new round of tougher UN sanctions, and only in the past few days has unveiled its own expanded sanctions \u2013 targeting secondary trade between Chinese and Namibian organisations and the North. But it is doubtful that these sanctions will deter Pyongyang from continuing with its missile tests, and at best they may end up imposing pain on ordinary North Koreans rather than its military. Military options for Tokyo are also of questionable value. Japan\u2019s Patriot weapons system is designed to stop missiles aimed at Japanese cities in their final descent, rather than flying over the country \u2013 perhaps a reason why no decision was taken to shoot down today\u2019s missile. Even if Tokyo had the weapons, a failure to bring down the target would undermine the country\u2019s limited deterrent capability \u2013 further emboldening the North Koreans. Some Japanese politicians and defence planners have recently argued that Japan should acquire cruise missiles and the satellite technology to strike at the North\u2019s missile launchers, either pre-emptively or in the early stages of a potential attack. However, such a move is at best a long-term solution, taking years, requiring substantial financial investment, and of questionable constitutional legitimacy. This leaves Abe with the diplomatic route \u2013 probably the most promising. Japan of course has been here before. In 2002 and 2004, prime minister Junichiro Koizumi took the bold step of visiting Pyongyang for direct talks with North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-il, the father of Kim Jong-un. The 2002 Pyongyang Declaration offered the prospect of a normalised relationship, with Japan offering substantial economic aid in return for the resolution of the abduction issue and an end to the North\u2019s missile testing. In the aftermath of today\u2019s test, Abe has made it clear that there is no room for dialogue with the North (a recognition of the political realities both in Japan and in other capitals). Ultimately, however, talking will need to be part of any long-term solution, perhaps once the North feels secure in its nuclear deterrent capabilities \u2013 the insurance card that will guarantee its long-term survival, and the most obvious reason for its single-minded determination to keep testing. At this point, Kim may believe that his secondary goal of promoting economic development can be achieved by trading a missile testing moratorium for a relaxation of international sanctions. There are then some carrots that could be offered to the North (both by Japan and potentially other nations) to encourage it to change course. The problem for now is that the sticks that are being deployed, whether economic sanctions or Donald Trump\u2019s rhetorical threat of \u201cfire and fury\u201d (apparently discounted by Kim, who has shown himself willing to call the US president\u2019s bluff), are not working. Military brinkmanship and Trump\u2019s attempt to draw strategic \u201cred lines\u201d over US territory, such as Guam, are not stopping the North from improving its missile and nuclear capabilities. Japan will need to work closely with the US and South Korea to explore new options for dealing with the North: reiterating the economic benefits to the North from diplomatic normalisation, but also stressing the increased isolation that will arise from further provocations \u2013 perhaps via efforts by the international community to delegitimise Kim\u2019s leadership and the sovereignty and independent status of the North Korea state. It may prove unsuccessful, but threatening the long-term survival of the Kim dynasty may be the best last-course option to force Pyongyang\u2019s leadership to rethink. \u2022 Dr John Nilsson-Wright is a senior research fellow for the Asia Programme at Chatham House and senior lecturer in Japanese politics and international relations at the University of Cambridge",
