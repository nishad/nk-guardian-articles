    "content": "Ah well, we had a good run, didn\u2019t we? I always thought the world would be destroyed by global warming, or some kind of computer virus, or the good Chris Evans (Captain America) and the bad Chris Evans (Radio 2) meeting each other and the universe exploding. But instead it\u2019s two pudgy idiots waving their massive phallic weapons at each other, and we all have to pay the price. Personally I think it\u2019s a shame \u2013 there\u2019s clearly chemistry between Kim and Don. They have similar interests (bad hair, crushing democracy, Kim\u2019s probably hosted the North Korean version of The Apprentice), and the passionate way they talk about destroying each other \u2013 fire and fury, power the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen \u2013 it\u2019s like watching Ross and Rachel. Just kiss already, guys! But I digress. The end of the world is nigh and soon the Earth will be a ball of uninhabitable fire and death. It\u2019s a real bummer. Fortunately though, we\u2019re on hand to assist you with Armageddon with a handy set of hints and tips. Just think of us as your personal Kirstie Allsopp, but armed with a chainsaw, and also we don\u2019t really care about where you wash your clothes. Presenting Our Ever So Helpful Guide For Surviving the Nightmare of Nuclear Dystopia! Tip 1: Have a big clothing clear-out! The apocalypse is a really great excuse to go through your wardrobe. What dresses haven\u2019t you worn for a while? Which tops are feeling a bit 2014? More importantly, which fabrics will protect against Earth\u2019s new radioactive atmosphere? Forget ripped jeans and crop tops, the new 2017 fashion is lead-lined trousers and a saucy little boiler suit, complete with gas mask. And as for homelife, keep in mind that al fresco living is so 2016. The new fad is living underground, cowering in a sewer or abandoned public toilet. Rock that subterranean couture, whether you\u2019re socialising with the last of humanity, hunting for vital resources or just kicking back with a glass of only slightly contaminated water and that worryingly vague slice of meat you found. Ham. It was \u2026 probably ham. Tip 2: Throw out the rulebook! Who can say what will be used as currency in the future? Will it be gold? Food? Solar power batteries? Those plush poop emoji toys you get at fairgrounds? Whatever it is, you\u2019ll need to keep it safe. The bad news is that without any police, you\u2019ll have to defend yourself. The good news is that pretty much anything can be used as a weapon now: a heavy stick, a filing cabinet, a hardcover copy of The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen (just read it aloud to would-be attackers and watch them recoil in horror). And there\u2019s more good news \u2013 there are no laws now! You can commit those crimes you always wanted! You can jaywalk! You can drink alcohol on the underground! You can publish sexually explicit cartoons featuring the likeness of Disney and Hanna-Barbera characters without fear of copyright law! Sure, society might have crumbled, but it will be a golden age of poorly drawn Mickey Mice getting it on with Top Cats. Eat your heart out, Halifax. Tip 3: Get a bit of culture! OK, so all music will probably have been wiped out in the Unholy Fires of Trump. But really, is that so bad? Have you heard the charts recently? Future generations will never have to find out what an Ed Sheeran is. The only thing that will survive will be what we remember. If you\u2019re anything like me, this means all classical music will be reduced to that bit in Bach where the violins go \u201cBa ba ba ba baaaaah\u201d and maybe the Star Wars theme. And with the obliteration of bookshops and libraries, literature will have to be pieced together through the tabs people still have open on their phone from before the internet went down, so there\u2019s a good chance the greatest surviving writing of our time will be an article from Wikihow on methods to get chocolate stains out of jeans. Tip 4. Reconnect with old friends! Specifically, ones who have been dead for several years, because there\u2019s a good chance the radiation will lead to the dead rising from their graves and attacking the living. Now would also be a good time to find out more about the new fad of \u201cbrain food\u201d \u2013 in that a lot of zombies will now see your brain as food. Try protecting your head with a helmet or a particularly flavourless hat. Tip 5: Reminisce about the old days Remembering the time before The Event could be tricky \u2013 it\u2019s dependent on people\u2019s memories and they can be fickle. We\u2019ll probably remember Donald Trump less as a president and more as a senior golfer who broke into the White House one day and fired off a few nukes, or maybe as a sentient orange Spacehopper, or maybe just as a big bag of snakes and rats dressed up in a suit and a red tie. How ever we do it, I hope we also remember the time before him, when there were actual sane people in important positions. They weren\u2019t perfect. Some of them were downright corrupt. Some of them indirectly killed many hundreds of thousands of people. But they didn\u2019t jeopardise the existence of life on this planet because of their own woeful self-importance. That doesn\u2019t feel like a particularly noble thing to praise, but right now I guess we shouldn\u2019t take it for granted. Now I\u2019m going to stock up on poop emoji toys. You know. Just in case. \u2022 Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and occasional performer",
