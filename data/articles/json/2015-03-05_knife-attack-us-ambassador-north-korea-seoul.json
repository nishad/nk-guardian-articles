    "content": "North Korea has described a knife attack that left the US ambassador in Seoul with a 11cm-long facial wound as \u201cjust punishment\u201d for joint US-South Korea military drills. A political extremist with a history of violence, named by police as Kim Ki-jong, attacked Mark Lippert during an event in Seoul on Thursday morning. Lippert received 80 stitches during two and a half hours of surgery and will remain under observation in hospital for at least three days, his doctors said. The US and South Korea condemned the attack, but North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency described it as a valid \u201cexpression of resistance\u201d. A brief statement referred to the weapon used to slash Lippert as the \u201cknife of justice\u201d. Lippert, 42, tweeted after the surgery: \u201cDoing well and in great spirits! Robyn, Sejun, Grigsby [his wife, son and dog] and I \u2013 deeply moved by the support! Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK [Republic of Korea] alliance!\u201d Chung Nam-sik, a doctor at Yonsei University\u2019s Severance hospital, said the surgery had been \u201cvery successful\u201d. He said Lippert had also sustained a cut to his left arm, damaging nerves connected to his little finger and tendons connected to his thumb, and might experience sensory problems in the hand for several months. The attacker was wrestled to the ground after lunging at Lippert with a fruit knife at a forum at the Sejong Cultural Institute, across the road from the US embassy. He loudly demanded the reunification of the Korean peninsula and condemned joint military exercises currently being held between the US and South Korea. \u201cI carried out an act of terror,\u201d he shouted as he was pinned to the floor. South Korean media said Kim, 55, was an anti-US and Japan activist. In 1985 he was part of a group that slashed and burned the US flag on the embassy grounds. He has also held one-man protests against Japanese claims to the Takeshima islands, known in Korea as Dokdo, which are administered by Seoul. In 2010, he received a three-year suspended prison sentence after throwing a piece of concrete at the Japanese ambassador to Seoul. In 2007, Kim reportedly tried to set himself on fire with petrol while protesting in front of the presidential Blue House, demanding a government investigation into an alleged 1988 rape in Kim\u2019s office, according to news reports. After his arrest on Thursday, Kim reportedly told police he had been planning the attack for 10 days. \u201cI made the sacrifice to stop Key Resolve,\u201d he said, referring to the name given to this year\u2019s US-South Korea military drills. Police are considering whether to charge him for attempted homicide, an official involved in the case said. In a blogpost, Kim said the annual military drills would ruin any attempts to bring about reconciliation between the two Koreas, more than six decades after the Korean peninsula was divided at the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. Unification ministry sources said Kim had visited North Korea at least six times in 2006-07, and had tried to erect a memorial to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il but was blocked by police and rightwing activists. South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye \u2013 herself the target of a knife attack in 2006 \u2013 condemned the incident as \u201cintolerable\u201d during a visit to the United Arab Emirates, calling it \u201cnot only a physical attack on the US ambassador in South Korea but also an attack on the South Korea-US alliance\u201d. The Korean Council for Reconciliation and Co-operation, a pro-unification group that hosted Thursday\u2019s event, condemned the attack and apologised to the governments of both countries. In Washington, the US state department spokeswoman Marie Harf said: \u201cWe strongly condemn this act of violence.\u201d The White House\u2019s National Security Council spokeswoman, Bernadette Meehan, said Barack Obama had spoken with Lippert after the attack. \u201cThe president called to tell him that he and his wife Robyn are in his thoughts and prayers, and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery,\u201d Meehan said. Witnesses described how the attack unfolded too quickly to prevent Kim from reaching Lippert, who was seated at a table. \u201cThe guy comes in wearing traditional Korean brown and tan dress. He yells something, goes up to the ambassador and slashes him in the face,\u201d said Michael Lammbrau, who works at the Arirang Institute thinktank in Seoul. \u201cPeople wrestled the guy to the ground, the ambassador was still in his chair. The ambassador fought him from his seat. He was escorted out afterwards,\u201d Lammbrau added. \u201cThere was a trail of blood behind him. He had about a seven inch-long gash on the right side of his face.\u201d A stunned-looking Lippert was able to walk to his car to be taken to hospital. He was seen holding a handkerchief to a cut on his right cheek, and the wrist on his other arm appeared to be bleeding heavily. Lippert has proved a popular ambassador during his time in Seoul and is a regular poster on social media. His wife gave birth in the city and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name. South and North Korea have remained effectively at war since 1953, when the Korean war ended in a ceasefire but not a peace treaty. The two countries have remained divided by the demilitarised zone \u2013 the world\u2019s most heavily armed border \u2013 ever since. The annual military drills, the latest of which began last week and will continue until April, have been blamed for raising tensions on the peninsula. North Korea routinely condemns the exercises as provocative, claiming they are practice for an invasion of the North. Seoul and Washington insist the drills are purely defensive. During drills in 2013 the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, threatened nuclear strikes on Washington and Seoul. On Monday, the North marked the first day of this year\u2019s exercises by test-firing short-range missiles.",
