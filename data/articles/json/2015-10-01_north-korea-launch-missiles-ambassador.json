    "content": "North Korea will not be deterred from plans to launch controversial long-range missiles by the threat of further sanctions, the country\u2019s ambassador to the UK said in a rare public appearance. Pyongyang insists the launches are part of a peaceful satellite programme but the US and its allies say they are disguised ballistic missile tests and a key component of a nuclear weapons development scheme. Pyongyang has hinted that it could fire one of the rockets in October to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers Party, a key political anniversary for the secretive nation. Doing so would invite fresh sanctions from the west, and probably derail plans for an inter-Korean family reunion set for late October. But ambassador Hyon Hak-bong told an audience at London\u2019s Chatham House that his government would consider any escalation of sanctions \u201canother provocation\u201d and would not be deterred. \u201cWe have nothing to be afraid of. We will go ahead, definitely, surely,\u201d Hyon said. \u201cWe are prepared to launch at any time or any place.\u201d Expert analysis of recent satellite images suggest North Korea has completed upgrades at its main Sohae satellite launch site, although analysts also say there has been no sign of activity to suggest an imminent launch. North Korea has been trying to perfect a multi-stage long-range rocket for decades, and used one to put its first satellite into space in late 2012 after several failures. The UN said it was a banned test of ballistic missile technology, as rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies, engines and other technology with missles, and imposed sanctions. The country insists its satellite project is peaceful and the global restrictions placed on it are unfair. \u201cLaunching satellites is the work performed by every country, it is the legitimate right of a sovereign state to develop a space programme,\u201d Hyon said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t use any such kind of sanctions against other countries.\u201d Earlier this month US secretary of state John Kerry warned that North Korea would face \u201csevere consequences\u201d if it continued with its announced decision to restart a nuclear reactor. Pyongyang has said it is restarting the long-mothballed Yongbyon reactor, which is capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium, and has threatened to launch a rocket, a move seen internationally as a test of ballistic missile technology.",
