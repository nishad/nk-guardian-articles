    "content": "President Obama has a choice. A few weeks ago, in Prague, he spoke eloquently for a nuclear weapons-free world. As part of this vision, he said that the United States would move aggressively to ratify the nuclear test ban treaty. His speech was welcomed by leaders across the world. Now his vision has been challenged by the DPRK's nuclear test in the early hours of 25 May, and he must choose how to respond. Registering 4.7 on the Richter scale, this test appears to have been more successful than the North Koreans' last attempt in 2006, which is thought to have \"fizzled\". Given the previous failure, it is hardly surprising that DPRK should test again. They said in a statement today: \"The republic has conducted another underground nuclear testing successfully in order to strengthen our defensive nuclear deterrence\". This is the logic of those who possess nuclear weapons. The UK, France, China, Russia and the US all had programmes of testing prior to the agreement of the comprehensive nuclear test ban (CTBT) in 1996, testing they claimed was essential to preserve their nuclear arsenals. International reaction to the DPRK's test has been harsh. President Obama said the test threatens world peace. Russia said the UN security council will meet. Tibor Toth, head of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation, said the test deserved \"universal condemnation\". Some degree of condemnation of the DPRK's action is unavoidable and necessary. But the international community needs to understand the DPRK is trying to focus attention on their situation, and move quickly to resolve it. In recent months relations between DPRK and its partners in the six-party talks aimed at resolving nuclear issues on the Korean peninsula have stalled. Pyongyang expelled UN inspectors and announced it would restart work at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, which had been suspended. And now this nuclear test. The DPRK is waiting for diplomatic overtures from the Obama administration. During his campaign, Obama promised direct talks with Iran and the DPRK. He has moved forward with Iran, but not with the DPRK, deepening the fear that haunts isolated policymakers in Pyongyang that the US is preparing for war. This fear grew from President Bush's \"axis of evil\" speech in 2002, and his nuclear doctrine allowing for pre-emptive nuclear strikes. This was a major driver of the nuclear programme in recent years. It appears that nuclear matters in north-east Asia have gone from bad to worse, and that there is little hope of agreement in the current climate. However, this impression may well be wrong. At the recent Hague meeting of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs (joint winner of the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize with its founder Joseph Rotblat), I was rapporteur for the working group on nuclear weapons issues. In several meetings over four days, the Korean peninsula featured prominently in our talks. The working group included participants (in their individual capacity) from all nations in the six-party talks including the DPRK, as well as many other nuclear weapons experts and experienced diplomats. Contrary to the harsh public rhetoric from Pyongyang of recent months, our Pugwash discussions suggested a path to progress and the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. This path would lead to the US and the DPRK normalising relations, including a US guarantee that it will not attack the DPRK, and full implementation of the 1994 Agreed Framework. In our discussions, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula was understood to mean the verified absence of nuclear weapons from the DPRK and from South Korea, the removal of the US nuclear umbrella from South Korea, no fuel cycle facilities under the denuclearisation agreement of 1992, and the ratification by both countries of the CTBT. Today it is obvious that nuclear weapons have not contributed to security in the peninsula. Now the DPRK has proven its nuclear expertise, they must sign and ratify the CTBT. This will help Obama to show strong leadership in a febrile atmosphere. He must continue his drive for CTBT ratification, and engage with China to encourage them to do the same, while his administration must make vigorous efforts to engage the DPRK. Our Pugwash discussions in The Hague show that there is a path to peace and security on the Korean peninsula. In taking that path, the president will need the support of his allies in rejecting isolation of Pyongyang. The prize is worth the effort, and the alternative of a nuclear stand-off with an unstable DPRK does not bear thinking about.",
