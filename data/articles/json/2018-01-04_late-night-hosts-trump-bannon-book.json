    "content": "Late-night hosts on Wednesday discussed the revelations in a new tell-all book by Michael Wolff about the Trump campaign and administration. \u201cAccording to a new book called Fire and Fury, Donald Trump didn\u2019t want to be president,\u201d began Stephen Colbert. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want him[self] to win. There\u2019s a name for that: the majority of American voters.\u201d \u201cTrump was planning on failing and walking away with the fame and the money,\u201d the host went on. \u201cOr, as the article described it: \u2018This was a real-life version of Mel Brooks\u2019s The Producers\u2019 ... Donald Trump Jr told a friend that, on election night, his father looked as if he\u2019d seen a ghost. Melania was in tears, and not of joy. Melania cried on election night? That is the first thing we have in common. Other than, of course, our smoky eyes.\u201d Colbert summarized more of the book\u2019s contents, including comments by Rupert Murdoch. \u201cDuring the transition, Trump called Murdoch to float an immigration plan that Murdoch thought would alienate his base,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cWhen he got off the phone, Murdoch reportedly shrugged and said: \u2018What a fucking idiot.\u2019\u201d Colbert continued: \u201cTwo things, Mr Murdoch. One, you\u2019re an Australian. You have no right to talk about our president that way. And two, is Australia currently accepting applications? Because I\u2019ve heard our president is a fucking idiot.\u201d Comedy Central\u2019s Trevor Noah focused on the president\u2019s Twitter activity in the new year, which has seen him compare the size of America\u2019s nuclear button to North Korea\u2019s. \u201cApparently, President Trump\u2019s new year\u2019s resolution was, \u2018I should spend more time on Twitter,\u2019\u201d Noah said, reading Trump\u2019s tweet to Kim Jong-un aloud. \u201cI know that Donald Trump is trying to be menacing here, but all I hear is a really catchy pop song. \u2018My button brings all the boys to the yard, and they\u2019re like, it\u2019s bigger than yours.\u2019 \u201cIf you had a supercomputer that could run a simulation to find the stupidest possible way to get into a nuclear war, this tweet is what would come up every single time,\u201d the host joked. Noah continued: \u201cTake a step back, and think about what pressing the button would actually mean. Hundreds of thousands of people incinerated instantly. And they would be the lucky ones. Millions more would die horribly in the next few weeks while any survivors would be left to suffer in the desolate world that is choked by poison ash. That\u2019s not for Twitter, people. At the very least that deserves a Tumblr post.\u201d Finally, Jimmy Kimmel further discussed the contents of Wolff\u2019s book and the dramatic falling out between the president and Steve Bannon that followed its partial release. \u201cWhile the weather is cold, the president is very, very hot right now,\u201d Kimmel began. \u201cLast night at 8 o\u2019clock, he tweeted: \u2018I will be announcing the most dishonest and corrupt media awards of the year on Monday.\u2019\u201d \u201cSounds like somebody\u2019s been in the White House laundry room eating Tide pods again, because the president of the United States is starting his own awards show for the media,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cOn one hand, he loves awards and trophies. But will he be physically able to give a trophy to someone other than himself?\u201d \u201cToday, Trump lashed out at Steve Bannon,\u201d Kimmel went on. \u201cSteven Bannon is Trump\u2019s former chief strategist who always looked like he was halfway through melting. He is quoted in a new book accusing Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son in law, of money laundering, accusing Donald Trump Jr of treason.\u201d \u201cNow you tell us?\u201d the host asked. \u201cThanks a lot.\u201d \u201cThis book paints a very unflattering picture of a detached and flat-out stupid president who eats at McDonald\u2019s because he\u2019s afraid of being poisoned,\u201d the host continued. \u201cHe sprays his hair with Just For Men and Ivanka makes fun of him for it. He\u2019s constantly leaking information about himself and then demands to know who leaked the information. He didn\u2019t want to win the presidency and was horrified when he did.\u201d Kimmel then read Trump\u2019s press release on Wednesday, in which he slammed Bannon, claiming he \u201chas nothing to do with me or my presidency\u201d and \u201clost his mind\u201d. \u201cThe rats are finally eating their young, is what\u2019s going on here,\u201d the host finished. \u201cThis administration is unlike anything ever. There are three news scandals every day. The wheels keep coming off and somehow the bus keeps rolling. I don\u2019t know how many wheels there are on this bus.\u201d",
