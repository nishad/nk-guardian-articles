    "content": "Park Yeon-mi was part of North Korea\u2019s black market generation \u2013 the millennials who grew up as illegal private trading flourished in the secretive, isolated country. Despite the country\u2019s official adherence to communist principals, more and more North Koreans now have greater unofficial loyalty to capitalism. After all, it was the state system that allowed an estimated one million people to starve during the \u2018arduous march\u2019 famine of the late 1990s. For Park, who escaped in 2007 with her family, it wasn\u2019t just exposure to free trade that opened her eyes to the limits of life in North Korea. It was foreign films, and most of all, a pirate copy of the 1997 Hollywood epic Titanic. \u2018A window on the outside world\u2019 When she was nine years old, Park was forced to attend the execution of her classmate\u2019s mother. Her crime? She had lent a South Korean movie to a friend. The townsfolk were gathered in a large stadium to watch the punishment. \u201cShe got killed in front of us,\u201d said Park, now 20 years-old. \u201cI was standing next to her daughter - my whole school had to go.\u201d Park now lives in Seoul, where she works for the for-profit think tank Freedom Factory Co to raise awareness about the hardships faced by those she left behind. In the North, watching or listening to unauthorised foreign media is regarded as a crime against the state punishable with forced labour, jail time, and even death. Despite this, the popularity of international movies and TV programmes \u2013 smuggled in over the border on USB sticks and CDs and sold on the black market \u2013 has grown rapidly. Crackdowns on foreign media in North Korea are a continuation of long-standing attempts by the government to suppress interest in foreign cultures. \u201cThere were different levels of punishment,\u201d says Park. \u201cIf you were caught with a Bollywood or Russian movie you were sent to prison for three years but if it was South Korean or American you were executed.\u201d However, despite her aunt\u2019s fate, Park and her friends could not give up the films that offered them \u201ca window for us to see the outside world\u201d. \u201cMy favourite movies were Titanic, James Bond and Pretty Woman - people smuggled in pirate copies from China,\u201d she told the Guardian by Skype from Seoul, after she attended a \u2018hackathon\u2019 event this month in Silicon Valley. Park remembers the price for a single DVD being around the same as 2kg of rice, so her family and her neighbours would share. \u201cEveryone was hungry so they couldn\u2019t afford to buy many DVDs,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if I had Snow White and my friend had James Bond we would swap.\u201d Organised by the New York-based NGO Human Rights Foundation, the event aimed to find new ways to get information safely into North Korea, to offer other people that window Park refers to. An editorial in the North Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun said the event\u2019s aims to overcome the country\u2019s tight controls on information were a \u201cfutile\u201d attempt to brainwash the population. For Park, information remains a crucial way to bring elements of freedom to North Koreans. She says she was afraid of getting caught, but \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop watching the movies because there was no fun in North Korea, everything was so mundane and when I watched them I saw something new and felt hope - fear didn\u2019t stop me nor will it stop others.\u201d \u2018Everything was about the leader\u2019 Studies show that access to foreign media undermines state control on several levels. A recent InterMedia report commissioned by the US State Department found that \u201cthe increase in direct media access has been accompanied by an increasing willingness among North Koreans to share information with those they trust\u2026 far fewer people seem to be reporting on each other than before.\u201d Casey Lartigue, a colleague of Park\u2019s at Freedom Factory Co, says information from foreign media offers a crucial alternative to the state\u2019s propaganda machine. \u201c[North Koreans] are brainwashed from birth into believing they have \u2018nothing to envy,\u2019 so outside media and information campaigns can give North Koreans the knowledge that there are other options out there.\u201d For the teenage Park, it was Hollywood love stories that had the biggest impact on the way she regarded her own home. \u201cEverything in North Korea was about the leader, all the books, music and TV,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what was shocking to me about Titanic was that the guy gave his life for the woman and not for his country \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t understand that mindset.\u201d \u201cThe other shocking thing about that movie was that it was set 100 years ago, and I realised that our country is in the 21st century and we still haven\u2019t reached that level of development,\u201d she said. Park says love for anything or anyone other than North Korea\u2019s leader \u2013 then the late Kim Jong-il, who was succeeded by his son Kim Jong-un in 2011 \u2013 was suppressed. \u201cIn North Korean culture, love is a shameful thing and nobody talked about it in public\u201d, she said. \u201cThe regime was not interested in human desires and love stories were banned.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew something was wrong. All people, it didn\u2019t matter their colour, culture or language, seemed to care about love apart from us - why did the regime not allow us to express it?\u201d Escape Though her exposure to foreign media raised many questions for Park, it was not until her father was imprisoned for illegally trading metal with Chinese counterparts that the family knew they had to escape. When he was released to get treatment for cancer, they took their chance, and fled across the border to China. The family still wasn\u2019t safe there; China regards North Korean defectors as economic migrants and is known to detain and repatriate refugees if they are caught. Park and her family hid indoors for 18 months before eventually making their way to Mongolia, where they finally found help to relocate to South Korea. Park says she believes young North Koreans can, and will, bring real change to their country. She says she hopes to one day return to a reformed North Korea, where people will enjoy wealth, freedom and love. \u201cAll the foreign movies we saw about love affected me and my generation,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we no longer want to die for the regime, we want to die for love.\u201d",
