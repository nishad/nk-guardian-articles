    "content": "With his extreme crew cut, chubby cheeks and a penchant for black button-up shirts and shiny brogues, Kim Jong-un is one of the world\u2019s most recognisable dictators \u2013 and one of the most memed and mocked. Now professional Kim impersonators are cropping up at football games, college campuses and even political protests and rallies. It\u2019s good work if you can get it. One impersonator, who asked to be identified as Howard, hung out with pop star Katy Perry at this year\u2019s Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. Another, who goes only by Jeremy, boasted of snogging up to 40 women when he went \u2013 in character \u2013 to Hong Kong\u2019s rugby sevens tournament in March. He was also snapped downing beer in the crowd. Howard is keen to stress that his character, whom he calls \u201cKim Jong-um\u201d, was the world\u2019s first professional Kim lookalike, predating his rival Jeremy. Howard markets himself as \u201cthe closest thing you will get to the Dear Leader without going to North Korea\u201d and speaks frankly about the fact that he\u2019s happy to \u201clend the character to projects that make extra money\u201d. Becoming Kim \u201cIt started in 2013 on April Fools day, I uploaded some pictures of me with a Kim Jong-un-esque haircut... Two weeks later I got a call asking me to go to Israel to shoot a burger commercial,\u201d says Howard, speaking on the phone from Hong Kong. But it\u2019s not just about the commercial gigs, he says. \u201cKim Jong-um\u201d attended Russia\u2019s Victory Day celebrations this year when the real Kim, who was on the Kremlin\u2019s guest list with a cast of other well-known autocrats, failed to show. Most Muscovites in the crowds got the joke and lined up for selfies, Howard says. But others were taken in, with one bystander apparently asking, in all seriousness, why he was \u201calone without his entourage\u201d. Howard has also used his character to raise the profile of a number of political protests, including the Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong, the pro-democracy movement which sprung up in 2014. He has also lent his face to protests organised by a group called North Korea Defector Concerns, rallying against China\u2019s forcible repatriation of North Koreans, a situation he has called \u201cunacceptable and extremely unethical\u201d. But the only North Koreans to come face-to-face with his character were those at the consulate in Hong Kong, which he visited as a part of a media stunt. \u201cThey were pissed off and called security,\u201d he says. Minyong Kim from South Korea has also adopted the look. He too first dressed up for fun before realising it could make for an interesting part-time vocation. Arguably his most impressive stunt was when he joined forces with Barack Obama impersonator Reggie Brown to croon a rendition of Eric Carmen\u2019s 1970s classic All By Myself on the streets of Seoul. He has since moved to the US to study where he has become \u201cthe most selfied guy on campus\u201d, he told News Gazette. Ethical mockery? Some might regard dressing up as a man accused of lauding over prison camps and millions of malnourished citizens as insensitive, but Howard insists his intention has never been to glorify the North Korean leader. Unlike Howard, Minyong has batted away any requests to lend himself to anything political. He explains that Liberty in North Korea, a US-based campaign group, \u201casked for my help but I will not do any political action \u2013 either agreeing or disagreeing [the] North Korean [government],\u201d he told the Guardian via email. Minyong says he has never tried to meet North Koreans in character as he knows they wouldn\u2019t appreciate it, but \u201cSouth Koreans know what I am doing, and many people think it is fun... just parody,\u201d he says. Generally the American public appreciate it too, but \u201csome extreme right [wing] conservatives act aggressively \u2013 they think I\u2019m am being un-patriotic,\u201d he adds. When News Gazette asked about Kim Jong-un himself he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think he really cares about me because he is the \u2018dear leader\u2019 of North Korea and I am just a normal citizen.\u201d Very few people Howard comes across have been annoyed or disgusted, he says. \u201cA few have quietly taken me aside toask \u2018you know who he is right?\u2019\u201d Fun though it might be for now, neither Howard nor Minyong are in it for the long haul. Howard says he has dreams to expand his music career, while Minyong insists it\u2019s just a stop gap. \u201cI do this impersonating to make college students laugh and remove stress from daily lives... [but] I have my own dream and career plan and Kim Jong-un impersonating is not major part of my life.\u201d Besides, his girlfriend has said she finds the whole thing abhorrent.",
