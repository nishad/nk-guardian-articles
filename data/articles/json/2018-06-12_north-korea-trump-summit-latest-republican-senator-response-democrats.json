    "content": "Lawmakers in Washington were skeptical of Donald Trump\u2019s confidence in striking a deal with a dictator after the president\u2019s historic Singapore meeting with Kim Jong-un. Republicans roundly applauded the summit between the US and North Korean leaders as a step toward peace in Asia. However, a handful of the GOP\u2019s foreign policy leaders on Capitol Hill warned that North Korea has failed to curb its nuclear ambitions despite similar commitments in the past. \u201cWhile I am glad the president and Kim Jong-un were able to meet,\u201d said Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, \u201cit is difficult to determine what of concrete nature has occurred.\u201d At the conclusion of the summit in Singapore, Trump and Kim signed what the US president touted as \u201cvery comprehensive\u201d agreement that would \u201ctake care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world\u201d. The document reaffirms North Korea\u2019s \u201cfirm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\u201d but it fails to provide a timetable or verification measures outlining the steps the nation would take to achieve denuclearization. \u201cAs negotiations now advance, there is only one acceptable final outcome: complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization,\u201d the House speaker, Paul Ryan, said in a statement. \u201cWe must always be clear that we are dealing with a brutal regime with a long history of deceit. \u201cOnly time will tell if North Korea is serious this time, and in the meantime we must continue to apply maximum economic pressure,\u201d he added. \u201cThe road ahead is a long one, but today there is hope that the president has put us on a path to lasting peace in the Korean peninsula.\u201d The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, similarly commended Trump for taking \u201can historic first step\u201d toward negotiations with Pyongyang. But he, too, suggested the next round of negotiations \u201cwill test whether we can get to a verifiable deal\u201d in remarks on the Senate floor. \u201cIf North Korea does not prove willing to follow through, we and our allies must be prepared to restore the policy of maximum pressure,\u201d McConnell said. Trump called Republican senators from Air Force One during their weekly lunch, on his way home to Washington. Afterwards, the Texas Republican senator John Cornyn told reporters that the \u201clesson\u201d of the Iran deal is that cutting Congress out of the equation makes any deal vulnerable to a new administration. \u201cI do think it\u2019s important that Congress give it the Good Housekeeping seal of approval because I think that would ensure longevity,\u201d Cornyn said. Meanwhile, Republicans also expressed concern over Trump\u2019s unexpected announcement that the US would suspend joint military exercises with South Korea in return for North Korea\u2019s commitment to denuclearize. In sharp contrast, Democrats condemned what they said was a lack of preparation on the part of the Trump administration and the president\u2019s perceived focus on image-making over substance. \u201cA diplomatic success would be the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, nothing less,\u201d Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said on the Senate floor. \u201cA nuclear North Korea with ICBMs probably presents a greater danger to the United States, and the safety and wellbeing of our country, than any other in the world. \u201cSo, it\u2019s imperative that we actually get action here \u2013 not just photo ops.\u201d Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware who sits on the foreign relations committee, said Trump had granted Kim legitimacy on the world stage without extracting any tangible concessions on human rights or denuclearization. \u201cFor this agreement with North Korea to mean anything, for it to be anything more than a reality TV handshake summit, there\u2019s going to need to be a lot of hard work in the months ahead,\u201d Coons said on MSNBC, adding: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that the Trump administration isn\u2019t prepared to do that hard work.\u201d Several lawmakers expressed lingering concerns over Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada, one of America\u2019s longstanding allies, over international trade. After departing the G7 summit over the weekend, the president derided the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, as \u201cvery dishonest and weak\u201d amid ongoing disagreements between the two leaders over Trump\u2019s decision to levy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump received a wary reception at the G7 summit, prompting some lawmakers to question the long-term impact on America\u2019s global influence. \u201cPresident Trump brutally ruptured relations with America\u2019s closest allies,\u201d said Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the foreign relations committee, while noting it was the G7 allies who joined the US in counter-terrorism operations and in the fight for democracy and human rights. \u201cPresident Trump gave them all the middle finger at the G7 summit and, increasingly, he\u2019s making it clear that if you have a history of friendship and alliance with the United States, you\u2019re going to pay a price. \u201cThis disastrous treatment of our allies makes the syrupy photo op he just gave the brutal dictator Kim Jong-un so dangerous,\u201d Murphy added. \u201cTrump\u2019s generous treatment of Kim, coming on the heels of his public rejection of our allies, sends a chilling message to those who are thinking about signing up for an alliance with the United States in the future.\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, was slightly less caustic than his Democratic colleagues, calling the meeting a \u201cpositive step in de-escalating tensions\u201d and \u201cmoving toward a more peaceful future\u201d. But he warned: \u201cCongress has an important role to play in making sure this is a meaningful and serious process and not just a series of photo ops.\u201d",
