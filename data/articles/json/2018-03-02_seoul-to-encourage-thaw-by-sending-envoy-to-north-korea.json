    "content": "South Korea plans to send a special envoy to North Korea as President Moon Jae-in works to encourage direct talks between Washington and Pyongyang on ending the nuclear programme of Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime. Moon told Donald Trump of his plans during a 30-minute phone call late on Thursday, the first in a month, according to a statement by the South\u2019s presidential office. The move comes after the North sent senior officials including Kim\u2019s younger sister to the South during the Winter Olympics. \u201cThe two heads of state agreed to continue the momentum in South-North dialogue so it may lead to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,\u201d Moon\u2019s office said. \u201cPresident Moon told President Trump that he will soon send a special envoy to North Korea \u2026 and confirm discussions held with high-level North Korean delegates.\u201d Moon said he wanted to reciprocate the official visits from the North. Sending the envoy could be the first step towards an eventual trip by Moon himself, after a surprise invitation presented by Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un\u2019s sister and close confidante, last month. It also followed a visit by Kim Yong-chol, a military commander and former spy chief, who repeatedly expressed Pyongyang\u2019s willingness to talk directly with the US. \u201cThe president wants to continue working with South Korea. It\u2019s a strong ally,\u201d the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said at a daily briefing. \u201cWe have no daylight between the two of us. We\u2019re going to continue those conversations. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to denuclearise the peninsula. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on and we\u2019re excited about any steps moving forward in that process.\u201d The White House confirmed the call took place, but did not mention the special envoy or Trump\u2019s reaction to the idea. \u201cThe two leaders committed to maintain close coordination,\u201d the White House said. Moon has tried to parlay a dramatic rapprochement between the two Koreas during the Olympics into more substantive talks over the North\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes, but it remains unclear if Kim Jong-un is willing to discuss denuclearisation. Trump has said he is willing to talk to the North but only \u201cunder the right conditions\u201d, a stance he has yet to clarify. Moon has said the bombastic leaders of both the US and the North need to find some common ground: \u201cThere is a need for the United States to lower the threshold for talks with North Korea and North Korea should show it is willing to denuclearise.\u201d Multi-party talks aimed at ending the North\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons have remained stalled since late 2008 and Pyongyang has made significant advancements in its nuclear programme in the past decade.",
