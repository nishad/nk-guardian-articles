    "content": "I watched PMQs at home yesterday while mending a hole in my trouser pocket, not the one created by George Osborne\u2019s tax hikes. For what it\u2019s worth in troubled times I thought Jeremy Corbyn did what he\u2019s paid to do by putting David Cameron on the back wellie over faulty flood management. But what appalled me \u2013 I have just reread Hansard to be sure \u2013 was how horribly parochial the occasion was and usually is nowadays. Yes, I know, floods were the session\u2019s dominant theme and floods are pretty serious even if your home has not been inundated. So are housing shortages, climate change, the threat to care homes and to Channel 4, Isis/Daesh\u2019s terrorist bravado and Emily Thornberry\u2019s links with Iraqi ambulance-chasing lawyers before she was promoted to be Islington\u2019s defence spokesman. But they will all pale into insignificance or become a great deal worse if Wednesday morning\u2019s reports are confirmed: that North Korea has successfully tested an H-bomb. It led next day\u2019s edition of the Guardian \u2013 as it should \u2013 but was inside-page news in all the other papers I take at home, even the FT. What does it take to scare some people? A five-year-old in a jihadi kit? So perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised there was not a word about it at PMQs, not even from any of the dwindling numbers of outward-looking MPs who realise that care homes, better flood defences and certainly anti-warming policies all depend on basic stability in the world\u2019s economic and political order. That must be why Dave made one such talented MP, Rory Stewart, floods minister. Oh dear. But systemic stability is now at serious risk, as even George Osborne seems to have noticed. In the current manic phase of his Treasury career, he has moved from alarm in his July budget to weird optimism in December\u2019s autumn statement (finding that \u00a32bn of funny money down the sofa must have helped). He is now back in gloomy mode over the \u201ccocktail of threats\u201d looming in 2016. The IMF is twitchy too. Ahead of a speech in Cardiff, Osborne popped up on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme to prime us all, but only succeeded in making listeners wonder why he kept stressing that the Bank of England is \u201cindependent\u201d \u2013 a dozen times, I\u2019d say. Has he quietly nationalised the central bank as Clement Attlee once did in a very different world and Venezuela\u2019s faltering Corbynistas did this week? We\u2019ll come back to them and we\u2019ll wait and see if scientific wind analysis bears out Pyongyang\u2019s claims to have cracked the H-bomb are true or just a stunt to keep the hungry citizens in fear and awe of the hereditary Marxist tyrant\u2019s power: Kim the Teenage Bomb Boy. If it\u2019s true that such flakes have got the bomb even mighty Beijing may be forced to take steps against its embarrassing neighbour. But that isn\u2019t the half of it. Also not mentioned in our elected representatives\u2019 new year return to PMQs was Saudi Arabia\u2019s alarming showdown with Iran and its likely impact on the deteriorating events in Syria, where Isis is losing territory while posting more boastful YouTube videos: a very postmodern combination of spin over substance. It\u2019s the time of year when Fleet Street\u2019s finest pundits make their predictions for the months ahead. Few take the opportunity to admit last year\u2019s mistakes except in general terms (Anatole Kaletsky was a rare exception before he left the Times over its paywall). But, as Nye Bevan famously remarked, why look into the crystal ball \u2013 always risky \u2013 when you can read the book? One week in and the financial year 2016 has started badly. Global stock markets (which hold much of the value of all our pensions) have caught fright over China\u2019s economic downturn and the Chinese government\u2019s futile attempts to rig tumbling market confidence. The FTSE in London had its worst start for ages, and the US market is propped up by a handful of giants, mostly bullish tech companies. This is all bad stuff. In Beijing, President Xi Jinping, who recently downed a pint with Dave near Chequers, is trying to tackle corruption (or is it merely enemies, Jeremy?) among China\u2019s communist elite. Xi could end up in jail himself if he pushes his luck and his rivals overthrow him. The US is entering an election year with a hesitant president retreating from his authority and Donald Trump, a fraudulent braggart, in serious contention for the Republican nomination. Scary stuff, but it\u2019s no better down south in Latin America, until recently a zone of rising hope. Argentina has gone Tory, Brazil\u2019s left-leaning presidency is in deep trouble over corruption. Oil-rich Venezuela, where Labour\u2019s leader and so many of his allies currently park their hopes of a fairer world, is gripped by soaring violence and inflation, coupled with food shortages. The showdown between the Chavista successor, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and the conservative MUD coalition that decisively won December\u2019s parliamentary election is coming to a dangerous climax over control of the courts and other state institutions \u2013 this in a country with the world\u2019s largest known oil reserves. We would once have been reading more about this than we do. Our politicians would be more engaged too. It matters, not just to Labour leftwingers. Closer to home, Spain also matters, where the once triumphant Socialist party, reduced to 90 seats in December\u2019s election, is torn between a rock and a very hard place. Should it prop up Mariano Rajoy\u2019s Popular party \u2013 the outgoing government reduced to 123 seats in the 350-seat cortes \u2013 in the interest of stability? Or should it join some form of coalition with the leftwing insurgents of Podemos (69 seats) and small regional parties? Either way the Socialist party loses. And, as in Scotland, Catalonia\u2019s ambitions for independence add to the uncertainty. Core Europe? Don\u2019t ask. There is a split between the prosperous north and the struggling south, another between the Eurosceptic periphery, Britain and the Scandies to the fore. A third is growing between the relatively liberal west and the former Iron Curtain countries of central Europe, now drifting back to authoritarianism as well as to barbed wire. In closing their borders they are trendsetters for post-Schengen Europe as not even winter stems the pitiful tide of refugees and migrants from broken and terrorised states to the south and east. Poland\u2019s new Law and Justice government is following Hungary\u2019s lead in attacking the independent courts and the media - alarming even British Tory MPs like the Polish-born Daniel Kawczynski. It was reported this week that Warsaw will help Cameron with his EU negotiations in return for British troops in Poland. Steady on there, Dave! Just across their much-invaded border in Berlin, Cameron\u2019s key ally, Angela Merkel, is starting to pay a potentially fatal price for misjudging her voters\u2019 tolerance of mass migration, a crisis intensified by the alleged \u201cimmigrant attacks\u201d on women in Cologne and other cities. As with Pyongyang\u2019s H-bomb, let\u2019s not rush to judgment. It\u2019s too sensitive. Chances are that the resilience of institutions everywhere will allow most, though not all, these flash points to become calmer. Black swan events are black swan events because they are rare. So caution and the bias towards continuity will probably calm down Law and Justice\u2019s reactionaries before Brussels starts handing out parking fines. Chances are Trump will be exposed as another Elmer Gantry, ripping off the poor. Kim\u2019s bomb may be a Lego one. It has already being reported that Nigel Farage\u2019s wheel nuts weren\u2019t loosened by a would-be assassin, but carelessly tightened by a car mechanic in Britain. Says the French garage that repaired his Volvo. We should be thankful for such small mercies. But black swan events do happen. Ask the flood victims of Scotland and the north of England, who were told they faced one in 100-year risks but whose swans keep floating back. A cocktail of black swan, chancellor! One week in my nightmare for 2016 resides in warmer countries. Iran and Saudi Arabia are both oil-cursed backward autocracies that impoverish and/or oppress their own people. Both are under political and financial pressure, both feel isolated and betrayed, the Saudis by Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Tehran, which they mistrust. It serves their regimes\u2019 interests to inflame sectarian religious passions for domestic purposes with consequences that ripple across the Middle East. The Saudis knew what they were doing when the executed Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, an inflammatory Shia cleric of the kind British judges allow to live on benefits in quiet suburbs. Not a nice man by most accounts, but they shouldn\u2019t have done it. The Saudis are our unlovely allies, the Iranians our scheming enemies. This could quickly go horribly wrong in the sort of way the assassination at Sarajevo went wrong in 1914. There\u2019ll be no room for flood management schemes if it does. We need pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will. But who will lead?",
