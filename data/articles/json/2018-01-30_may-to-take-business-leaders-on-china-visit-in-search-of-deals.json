    "content": "Theresa May will attempt to reset her relationship with China in a vital three-day trip this week, leading the largest-ever UK trade delegation, comprising 50 business leaders. Beijing\u2019s ambassador to London has claimed Brexit is a \u201cstrategic opportunity\u201d to boost ties, saying \u201cgolden fruits\u201d will be up for grabs when May touches down in China on Wednesday. Downing Street said the visit will \u201cintensify the \u2018golden era\u2019 in UK-China relations\u201d, a phrase often used by David Cameron and George Osborne dating from President Xi\u2019s state visit to the UK in 2015. However, while Chinese officials talk up the visit as a chance to write a new chapter of \u201cwin-win\u201d relations, most observers agree Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has severely eroded both its negotiating position and its value to Beijing, which once considered London a key EU ally. \u201cClearly they did lose interest in the UK,\u201d said one well-placed monitor of Chinese politics who, like many, believes China\u2019s focus has now shifted to France. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, beat May to Beijing when he passed through earlier this month, bestowing a horse on Chinese leader Xi Jinping as a symbol of their warming friendship. Beijing is likely to be keenly aware of its sway over the weak leader of a feuding party governing a divided nation \u2013 and will therefore seek the maximum number of concessions in exchange for its support. It is also pushing for a resounding endorsement of the Belt and Road initiative, a $900bn global infrastructure spree that is Xi\u2019s pet foreign policy programme. May\u2019s reluctance to offer her formal blessing to a project some suspect is a ploy to extend Beijing\u2019s global political and economic reach has complicated pre-visit talks. Chinese officials have reportedly even refused to answer calls from their British counterparts. No. 10 sounded a cautious note on the scheme. \u201cThis is one of the things the prime minister will be talking about when we are in China, I wouldn\u2019t want to pre-empt those discussions,\u201d the spokesman said. Experts said the prime minister\u2019s efforts will be complicated further by her personal standing in Beijing. While Xi was recently confirmed as China\u2019s most dominant ruler in decades, May is seen as a hamstrung leader whose days in office may be numbered and who is less pro-Beijing than her predecessor, David Cameron. May riled China\u2019s leaders by delaying approval for the Beijing-backed Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant and then baffled them with last year\u2019s botched election. Steve Tsang, the head of the School of Oriental and African Studies\u2019 China Institute, said: \u201cThis is a prime minister who will be seen in Beijing as a paper tiger who pretends to take tough positions but, in fact, is as weak as it gets.\u201d Tsang said China\u2019s ambassador was right to describe Brexit as an opportunity \u2013 \u201ca huge opportunity for Beijing\u201d. Kerry Brown, the director of the Lau China Institute at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cI think they will see her as a biddable leader who is quite weak and who will need something \u2013 and they will be very aware of their power over such a visitor. She has got to obviously avoid this idea that she is going there with a begging bowl, even though, in fact, that is kind of what she is doing.\u201d British officials pointed to figures showing trade between the UK and China is at record levels and UK exports to China have grown by over 60% since 2010, underscoring the mutual benefits of a liberal future trade partnership. In talks with Xi, May is expected to raise North Korea\u2019s belligerence, stressing the need for co-operation in support of the rules-based international system. More difficult for the prime minister will be the growing concern over the political situation in Hong Kong. On Monday, Hong Kong\u2019s last governor, Lord Patten, called on May to challenge Beijing over its erosion of the former British colony\u2019s rights and freedoms, highlighted this week when Agnes Chow, one of the most recognisable faces of its moderate \u201cumbrella\u201d protest movement was barred from running for political office as a result of her political views. Downing Street would not confirm whether the topic was on May\u2019s official agenda. \u201cThe UK has always been clear and continues to be clear that it\u2019s vital Hong Kong\u2019s rights and freedoms are respected and we are firm believers in one country, two systems \u2013 we welcome the Chinese commitment to it,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. May said the delegation of British businesses represented all corners of the UK economy. \u201cThere are huge trade opportunities in China that we want to help British businesses take advantage of,\u201d she said. The business delegation includes financial services, technology, automotive, food and drink, energy and infrastructure developers, including BP, Jaguar Land Rover and Whittards, the tea manufacturer. May and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, will land in Wuhan on Wednesday, a historical city, which has the most students of any city in the world. In Beijing later on Wednesday, she will meet Chinese premier Li Keqiang and then Xi on Thursday, before travelling to Shanghai to meet British and Chinese business leaders on Friday. For the first time on a solo trip, May will be accompanied by her husband, Philip, a supportive presence for the prime minister while the debate rages over her future at home on her backbenches.
