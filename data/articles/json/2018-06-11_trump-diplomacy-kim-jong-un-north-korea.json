    "content": "A battered phoenix is struggling to rise from the ashes of the G7 fiasco. It is diplomacy, Trump-style. The American president in Singapore today appears determined, against all odds, to cut some sort of deal to denuclearise North Korea. To him, the G7 summit in Canada was a pointless gathering of political toffs. North Korea is different. He has made it his own. Having proposed a deal, then cancelled it, then proposed it again, failure would be glaring. Donald Trump\u2019s diplomacy would be fascinating were it not so dangerous. Dealings between modern states are about rules and courtesies for a good reason. They are better than war. Trump left Qu\u00e9bec insulting his host as \u201cdishonest\u201d and a back-stabber, and scattering blood-curdling threats of trade sanctions at his closest allies. What he was really doing was calling their bluff. To him, G7\u2019s cosy chats are a waste of time, not least because the two powers that really matter, Russia and China, are not there. The Korea stand-off has long been a blot on the face of diplomacy, resulting in the emergence of the world\u2019s most alarming nuclear power. Whether it \u201cthreatens\u201d the US may be moot, but it is unfinished business, and America\u2019s (and China\u2019s) responsibility. Traditional diplomacy has failed for half a century to curb the world\u2019s most vainglorious tyranny. Why not try Trump diplomacy? Kim Jong-un is reportedly desperate to relieve his country of economic strangulation, with his Chinese backers turning against him. He has won as much global attention as he needs with nuclear weapons. They are plainly unusable. Meanwhile his citizens are fed up with seeing their cousins in the south prospering. It can\u2019t go on. Kim\u2019s people might love him all the more if he brought them peace and prosperity. Can Trump pander to this man\u2019s vanity, while understanding that success will pander to his own? It cannot be beyond the bounds of negotiation to sequence North Korea\u2019s nuclear disarmament, dismantling and verification against America\u2019s sanctions relaxation, troop withdrawal and aid. In the middle stands a key figure \u2013 South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in \u2013 with a massive interest in peace. It should be doable, and the old methods have not done it. The one virtue of Trump\u2019s diplomatic style is blatancy. It turns its back on politesse. It is loud, personal, real and leaves little scope for misunderstanding. Just conceivably it could be the one diplomacy that Kim understands. If not, Trump will have failed, and his G7 vulgarities will have been re-emphasised by naivety. But if he pulls it off, he will have secured a real coup. He could justly claim that his methods have made the world a safer place. It will be back to the drawing board for traditional diplomacy. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian staff columnist",
