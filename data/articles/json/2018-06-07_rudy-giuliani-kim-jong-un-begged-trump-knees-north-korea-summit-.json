    "content": "Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has boasted that Donald Trump had forced North Korea\u2019s leader to beg to re-schedule a high-profile summit after the president abruptly called off the meeting. After the cancellation, \u201cKim Jong-un got back on his hands and knees and begged for it, which is exactly the position you want to put him in,\u201d Giuliani told a business conference in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. In an interview later with the Associated Press, Giuliani rejected suggestions that such comments might sour the atmosphere before next week\u2019s summit, saying Kim Jong-un must understand the US is in a position of strength. \u201cIt is pointing out that the president is the stronger figure,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to have useful negotiations unless he accepts that.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s strong language reflects that of Trump, who threatened Kim with the same fate as Muammar Gaddafi if the North Korean leader \u201cdoesn\u2019t make a deal\u201d on his nuclear weapons programme. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, has also caused a storm by insisting North Korea would have to dismantle its nuclear arsenal completely and immediately, rousing a senior Pyongyang official to say that Kim would not take part in a summit with such \u201cone-sided\u201d goals. Bolton also referred to the \u201cLibya model\u201d, irking a regime that has repeatedly pointed to Gaddafi\u2019s grisly death in a Nato-backed insurgency eight years later as a reason not to give up nuclear weapons. Giuliani said Trump had no choice but to call off the meeting after the North Koreans insulted vice-president Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton and threatened \u201cnuclear annihilation\u201d of the US. \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t take that. What he did was he called off the summit,\u201d Giuliani said. Giuliani said Kim quickly changed his position, expressed willingness to discuss denuclearisation and asked to have the meeting again. \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean by begging for it,\u201d Giuliani said. The summit is back on, in Singapore next Tuesday. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer in the Russian investigation, noted that he was sharing a personal opinion and was not part of the US foreign policy team. Associated Press contributed to this report",
