    "content": "The United Nations security council is likely to meet on Wednesday to discuss North Korea\u2019s latest ballistic missile launch, which was an \u201cunacceptable violation\u201d of a UN ban, the French ambassador to the UN, has said. \u201cWe want a quick and firm reaction of the Security Council on this,\u201d said Francois Delattre, after the regime in Pyongyang carried out its most successful test to date on a powerful medium-range missile that is capable, in theory, of striking US bases in the region. The second of two Musudan missiles launched by the North on Wednesday morning flew 250 miles (400km). That was the longest distance a Musudan has achieved to date and equivalent to more than halfway to the south-west coast of Japan\u2019s main island. Tokyo expressed concern about the growing military threat. \u201cThe threat to Japan is intensifying,\u201d Gen Nakatani, the Japanese defence minister, said. Experts said North Korea appeared to have launched the second missile on an unusually high trajectory so that it would avoid violating Japanese air space. The missiles are usually test-fired at a flatter angle to maximise their range, according to Jeffrey Lewis at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. \u201cThat suggests the missile worked perfectly,\u201d he said. \u201cHad it been fired at its normal angle, it would have flown to its full range.\u201d Lewis warned that North Korea would eventually iron out any technical problems with the Musudan and then use the lessons to increase the threat to the US. \u201cIf North Korea continues testing, eventually its missileers will use the same technology in a missile that can threaten the United States,\u201d he said. It was not immediately clear whether Pyongyang considered the second Musudan launch a success or failure, or how the flight ended. But it appeared to have been more successful than the first launch two hours earlier, which ended when the missile disintegrated mid-flight after covering about 90 miles, according to South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. The second Musudan, launched from the same east location as the first, reached an altitude of 620 miles \u2013 an indication, Nakatani said, that the country was making progress in its programme to develop a reliable intermediate-range weapon capable of hitting targets that could include South Korea, Japan and the US Pacific territory of Guam. The launches also demonstrate the determination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to defy UN security council resolutions banning North Korea from developing ballistic missile technology. \u201cThese provocations only serve to increase the international community\u2019s resolve to counter [North Korea\u2019s] prohibited activities, including through implementing existing UN security council sanctions,\u201d US state department spokesman John Kirby said. \u201cWe intend to raise our concerns at the UN to bolster international resolve in holding [North Korea] accountable for these provocative actions.\u201d Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the launches were a clear violation of security council resolutions, adding that Japan would \u201crespond to the situation through coordination with the United States and South Korea\u201d. The first launch on Wednesday is thought to have been the fifth time in a row the regime has failed to successfully fire a Musudan, which has an estimated range of between 1,550 and 2,485 miles. In April, North Korea attempted unsuccessfully to launch three suspected Musudan missiles, but all exploded in mid-air or crashed, according to South Korean defence officials. Late last month, North Korea had another suspected Musudan failure, South Korean officials said. Nakatani described the launches as a \u201cserious provocation\u201d, while South Korea was to hold a meeting of national security experts to discuss the Musudan threat. The South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, said repeated missile and nuclear tests had set North Korea on the path to self-destruction. \u201cThe North Korean regime should realise that complete isolation and self-destruction await at the end of reckless provocation,\u201d Park said. North Korea is believed to have up to 30 Musudan missiles, which officials said were first deployed around 2007, although the North had never attempted to test-fire them until April this year. Yonhap quoted an unidentified senior government official in Seoul as saying that the second test demonstrated an obvious \u201cimprovement in capacity and technology\u201d. The UN security council, with the support of the North\u2019s main diplomatic ally China, imposed new sanctions in March after Pyongyang conducted its fourth nuclear test and launched a long-range rocket. North Korea claimed the rocket was carrying an observation satellite, but the launches are seen as an opportunity for the state to test ballistic missile technology.",
