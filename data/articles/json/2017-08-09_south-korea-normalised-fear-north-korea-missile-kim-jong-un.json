    "content": "Perhaps the best way to overcome the fear of North Korea\u2019s military threats is to live where the beast is the closest \u2013 South Korea. I live in \u201cthe Seoul region\u201d, the area including and surrounding the capital, where about half the country\u2019s 51 million people are concentrated. I also live less than 200km from Pyongyang, North Korea\u2019s capital city, and less than 300km from Yongbyon, where a major nuclear facility is located. In other words, Seoul is well within reach of North Korea\u2019s nukes and missiles, many of which have been decorating the headlines with increasing frequency in recent years. Yet when North Korea fired another long-range ballistic missile on 28 July \u2013 its 12th test in 2017 alone \u2013 most South Koreans hardly batted an eyelid. Friday night continued on the streets of Seoul with no visible sense of urgency (unless you were a journalist, in which case your night would have been ruined by having to exasperatedly call the defence ministry). I remember interviewing people on the street after Pyongyang claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in January 2016. Many were unfazed; there was even a teenager who had no idea a test had taken place. Residents of South Korea who have friends abroad often share inside jokes about how outsiders are way more alarmed than everyone here, who would actually be wiped out if Kim Jong-un ever ordered a nuclear attack on this country. In the face of this seeming calm, even indifference, it\u2019s easy to hastily resort to the oft-parroted narrative that \u201cSouth Koreans are jaded/uninterested\u201d because they have been exposed to these threats for so long. The reality of South Korean \u201cindifference\u201d is complex and even contradictory. Widespread indifference to North Korea is definitely real \u2013 especially among the younger generation, whose education was not as strictly dictated by cold war ideologies \u2013 but it coexists with a deeply personal attachment that many South Koreans \u2013 even the young \u2013 still harbour to North Korea. South Korean history and identity are, paradoxically, indivisible from the northern neighbour it was decisively separated from 67 years ago when the Korean war began. Spy missions, terrorist attacks, verbal and physical threats, one-dimensional portrayals of \u201cThe Other\u201d as \u201cThe Beast\u201d; all this has existed, on both sides of the border, throughout modern Korean history. But this pervasive narrative of North Korea as a dangerous, existential threat coexisted with an equally pervasive narrative that it was \u201cour brother\u201d. The majority of South Koreans still want unification. And many South Koreans, including myself, cried when teams from both sides walked hand in hand in the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics in 2000. What makes the idea of North Korea even more complicated to South Koreans is the stigma surrounding the North. The \u201cred scare\u201d is still prevalent in political discourse, especially in the rhetoric of the conservatives, who adopt a more hardline approach to Pyongyang. In 2014, for instance, a leftist party was disbanded by the then conservative administration for allegedly being sympathetic to the North. The more hardline members of my family derogatorily call the current left-leaning president, who wants to engage more with Pyongyang, \u201ca communist\u201d. This atmosphere of fear transfers to the larger public. Because of fear, it\u2019s difficult for ordinary citizens to access materials from North Korea: North Korean websites are blocked, along with the likes of pornography, and Seoul\u2019s only North Korean library forbids its users to share its materials outside library premises, including on social media. People have been censored, deported and imprisoned by the South Korean state for saying the \u201cwrong\u201d things. This fear restricts South Koreans from expressing \u201ctoo much\u201d interest. The seeming indifference that South Koreans exhibit in the face of North Korean provocations is not just indifference. It\u2019s not just that Pyongyang\u2019s threats have become so routine as to now be a bore (although it certainly is in many ways, perhaps misleadingly so). Behind the indifference lies also years of fear, deep and even subconscious, a glaring lack of information and unavoidable ignorance about what really is happening. The problem is the South Korean indifference comes at a time of global uncertainty. Donald Trump is an inconsistent president; China\u2019s role is still suspiciously ambiguous; Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, is trying to dramatically reverse his conservative predecessor\u2019s policies. Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime has tested more missiles in the past six years than his forefathers did in six decades. And so reaction here can leap from one extreme to another. \u201cAre you scared by North Korean missiles?\u201d I asked my mother recently. \u201cNot at all,\u201d she laughed. Then she paused. \u201cI guess we would all get killed, though.\u201d \u2022 Haeryun Kang is managing editor of English-language news outlet Korea Expos\u00e9",
