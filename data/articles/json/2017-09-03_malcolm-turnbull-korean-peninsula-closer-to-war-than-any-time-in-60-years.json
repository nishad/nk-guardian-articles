    "content": "Malcolm Turnbull has labelled Kim Jong-un \u201cevil\u201d and warned the Korean peninsula is \u201ccloser to war than at any time\u201d since the Korean War. In comments to ABC\u2019s AM on Monday the prime minister also used the crisis to discourage the Labor opposition from causing chaos in parliament, accusing it of \u201cplaying political games\u201d rather than focusing on the international events. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said the North Korean test of a hydrogen bomb was a \u201cserious escalation\u201d of tensions on the peninsula, warning the bomb was \u201cexponentially more powerful than previous tests\u201d. Turnbull said that although North Korea \u201cis not a puppet state of China\u201d, China had the \u201coverwhelmingly dominant economic relationship\u201d with North Korea and \u201ccan do more\u201d to resolve the crisis. \u201cThis test is a direct affront to China ... Kim Jong-un has chosen to affront China, to defy China, and this calls for a strong Chinese response,\u201d he said. Asked if China could cut off North Korea\u2019s oil, Turnbull said that \u201cabsolutely would be a lever that China could pull, and that would put enormous economic pressure on the regime\u201d. \u201cThe Chinese are frustrated and dismayed by North Korea\u2019s conduct, but China has the greatest leverage, and with the greatest leverage comes the greatest responsibility. \u201cHaving a near-neighbour that is bringing the Korean peninsula closer to war than at any time since the end of the Korean War cannot possibly be in China\u2019s interests.\u201d Asked if he shared former prime minister John Howard\u2019s assessment that Kim was \u201cevil\u201d, Turnbull said: \u201cYes, I don\u2019t think there is any doubt about that.\u201d Turnbull cited Kim\u2019s assassinations of members of his family and starvation of the North Korean people. \u201cThis is a shocking, dangerous, provocative, illegal regime that is threatening the peace and security of the region and the world.\u201d Asked about Labor\u2019s threat to disrupt parliament to put pressure on the deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce over his eligibility to sit as an MP, Turnbull said it \u201csays a lot about the Labor party\u201d that it would do so \u201cwhen we\u2019re facing the greatest threat of war on the Korean peninsula in 60 years\u201d. \u201cAustralians will be sickened by the sight of the Labor party\u2019s failure to recognise the priorities of the Australian parliament, [which] is to keep Australians safe and to support the opportunity, the economic opportunity that Australians deserve,\u201d he said. \u201cThat requires the parliament to focus on the real issues, rather than playing political games.\u201d At a doorstop in Canberra, Bishop said new sanctions that will take effect in September were \u201cthe toughest most comprehensive set of sanctions against North Korea to date\u201d and must be used to deter it from \u201ccarrying out any more illegal tests\u201d. The sanctions ban coal, lead, iron ore and seafood exports, and introduce new visas for North Korean workers so they cannot send remittances home. Asked about Donald Trump\u2019s threat that the United States is considering cutting trade with countries that do business with North Korea, such as China, Bishop said it was a \u201cvery significant step\u201d. \u201cIt reflects the gravity with which the United States views the current situation with North Korea,\u201d she said. But the current round of sanctions had been supported by China and \u201cthey have a long way to go\u201d. Asked if Australia could stop trading with China to put pressure on North Korea, Bishop said both China and the United States were major trading partners and Australia wanted \u201cto avoid any kind of trade war\u201d between the two. \u201cWe certainly back the United States\u2019 concerns and the concerns of China that North Korea should be prevented from accessing the finance that it is using for its illegal weapons program.\u201d",
