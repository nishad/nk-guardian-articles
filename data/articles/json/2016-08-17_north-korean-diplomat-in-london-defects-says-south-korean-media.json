    "content": "A senior diplomat from the North Korean embassy in London has defected in the first case of its kind since official ties were established and the embassy opened 13 years ago. Thae Yong Ho, who vanished earlier this month with his wife and children, was based at North Korea\u2019s suburban embassy in Ealing, west London. Seoul\u2019s unification ministry confirmed on Wednesday he had recently defected to South Korea with his family. Thae is the highest-level North Korean official to have defected to South Korea, Jeong Joon-hee, a spokesman at the unification ministry, told a news conference. He was \u201csick and tired of the Kim Jong-un regime\u201d, yearned for a liberal and democratic country and was worried about his children\u2019s future, Jeong said. Jeong suggested that the case showed that disillusionment among North Korea\u2019s ruling class was widespread, with the regime weakening and at \u201cbreaking point\u201d. One of five officials at the embassy in addition to the ambassador, Thae\u2019s job was to keep track of North Korean defectors living in London. He was also tasked with rebutting UK criticism of his country\u2019s human rights record, South Korean media reported. A self-deprecating figure who speaks impeccable English, Thae appeared on video in 2013, addressing a meeting of the British Communist party. He also gave an address at a bookshop in King\u2019s Cross in 2014 comparing life in London and Pyongyang. Thae\u2019s younger son had attended a school in west London, and according to one of his classmates, he vanished in mid-July. \u201cWe were really good friends. He was on Facebook every day and WhatsApp. Suddenly all his social media accounts went dark,\u201d Louis Prior, 19, said. Prior said his friend had been born in Denmark, where his father was posted. The family returned to North Korea and arrived in the UK four years ago. Thae\u2019s son had taken his A-levels and was about to take up a place at Imperial College London, studying maths and computer science. \u201cWe have been really worried about him. We all tried his phone. It\u2019s been blocked. He\u2019s a good mate. He just vanished,\u201d Prior said. The defection is a coup for British and other western intelligence agencies. John Nilsson-Wright, the head of the Asia programme at Chatham House, said the diplomat could have useful insider information on Kim Jong-un\u2019s secretive regime. \u201cThese senior officials are smart, accomplished, well-trained individuals with high levels of English. If sent abroad they don\u2019t spend their time going to cocktail parties. They will be energetic in other activities, including using foul means or fair,\u201d he said. Intelligence agencies would want to question Thae about Kim\u2019s leadership, the stability of his regime and the fate of senior members of the previous government, some of whom have been purged and executed. \u201cThey would want insight into the last three or four years since he took over,\u201d Nillson-Wright said. Nillson-Wright described relations between the UK and North Korea as complicated and variegated. Britain has had an ambassador in Pyongyang since 2001. There is an ongoing cultural dialogue, including academic exchanges whereby North Korean students can study at Cambridge university. North Korea\u2019s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, is a former ambassador to London, and has close ties with the current incumbent, Hyun Hak-bong. The original tipoff that an official had fled came from an anonymous source inside North Korea, NK News reported on Tuesday. Defecting from North Korea is risky. The regime usually exacts revenge on relatives and friends at home. It has also been known to pursue defectors abroad and, if it finds them, to \u201cmete out draconian punishment\u201d, Nillson-Wright said.",
