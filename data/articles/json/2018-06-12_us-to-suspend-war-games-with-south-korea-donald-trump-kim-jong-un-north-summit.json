    "content": "Donald Trump has ordered the suspension of US military exercises with South Korea, in a surprise concession at an extraordinary summit with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The US had previously ruled out such a move on the grounds that the exercises were a key element of its military alliance with Seoul and deterrent against North Korea. In return for the US concession, Kim signed a joint statement committing to denuclearisation, but it was a vaguely worded commitment that the regime has made several times before over the past three decades. Asked what would be different this time, Trump pointed to his instincts as a dealmaker. \u201cWe got to know each other well in a very confined period of time,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI know when somebody wants to deal and I know when somebody doesn\u2019t.\u201d As proof of Kim\u2019s good intentions, Trump said Kim had offered to destroy a missile engine testing site. \u201cI got that after we signed the agreement,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said: do me a favour. You have this missile engine testing site \u2026 I said can you close it up. He\u2019s going to close it up.\u201d Nuclear weapons experts suggested the site in question could be the Hamhung missile site, thought to have been damaged in a recent engine test. They said it was a minimal part of North Korean weapons programme. By contrast, the cancellation of the military exercises has been a priority for North Korea for decades. Surprising US allies in the region, Trump declared that the war games, involving planes flying long distances, were too expensive. \u201cWe will be saving a tremendous amount of money. Plus, it is very provocative,\u201d Trump said. Trump noted that Kim had committed his regime to \u201cwork towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d. However, the joint statement did not define what denuclearisation meant, a point of longstanding contention between the US and North Korea. Denuclearisation is the longstanding policy of the Pyongyang regime, but the regime interprets this as being an open-ended, gradual process in which other nuclear powers will also disarm. Absent from the joint statement was the definition, promoted up until now by the Trump administration, of complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement (CVID). Asked at a press conference why those terms were not included, Trump replied: \u201cBecause there\u2019s no time. I\u2019m here one day. It wasn\u2019t a big point today because really \u2026 this has been taken care of before we got here.\u201d The outcome of the summit appeared to be a solution that had been championed by Beijing, a \u201cfreeze for freeze\u201d in which the North Koreans continue to suspend nuclear and long-range missile tests while the US halts military exercises and does not impose new sanctions. It is solution that the US had hitherto rejected, arguing that it implied an equivalence between North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme and South Korea\u2019s right to maintain its defences in concert with allies. Both the South Korean government and US forces in the region appear to have been taken by surprise by Trump\u2019s declared suspension of joint exercises. US forces in Korea said they had not received updated guidance on the matter. \u201cIn coordination with our ROK [Republic of Korea] partners, we will continue with our current military posture until we receive updated guidance,\u201d a spokesperson told Reuters. The South Korean presidency issued a statement saying: \u201cAt this moment, the meaning and intention of President Trump\u2019s remarks requires more clear understanding.\u201d Kelly Magsamen, who was a senior Pentagon official dealing with Asian and Pacific security in the Obama administration, said Trump\u2019s announcement \u201ccontinues [his] disturbing pattern of undermining our democratic alliances while praising our adversaries\u201d. Trump said he accepted that dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal would take a long time, but it would be carried out \u201cas fast as it can be done scientifically, as fast it can it be done mechanically\u201d. On the complex question of how North Korean disarmament would be verified, Trump was vague. \u201cWe will be verifying,\u201d he maintained. \u201cIt will be achieved by having a lot of people there. As we develop a certain trust.\u201d The language on disarmament in the Singapore statement was similar to that of previous agreements, in 1994 and 2005, which ultimately collapsed amid differences over interpretation and arguments about verification. Trump said the summit on Tuesday would be followed next week by more negotiations between US and North Korean officials to work out the details of the agreement. Before his press conference, reporters were shown a video that Trump said he had played to Kim and his aides towards the end of their talks. It was credited to Destiny Productions and was presented in Korean and English in the style of an action movie trailer. It sought to illustrate alternative futures for North Korea: one a bright, colourful world of scientific progress and happiness, the other a monochrome world full of weaponry accompanied by ominous music. Only one person could choose between these two destinies, the film\u2019s narrator said. In assessing the outcome, some analysts argued that the suspension of nuclear and missile tests coupled with a halt to military exercises at least defused tensions and created space for possible disarmament in the future. Others were more sceptical. Beatrice Fihn, the executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), tweeted: \u201cWe support diplomacy and peaceful solutions. But there is no agreement on nuclear disarmament and this all looked more like a big welcome party to the nuclear-armed club.\u201d Vipin Narang, an expert on the North Korean nuclear programme, was even more scathing. \u201cPresident Trump said he was going to take away Kim\u2019s nuclear weapons,\u201d Narang said in a tweet. \u201cInstead he legitimised the value of nuclear weapons in international politics. Even a \u2018pipsqueak fourth-rate power\u2019 can bring the US to the table and win if it has nuclear weapons.\u201d Kim also undertook to cooperate with the US in the recovery of the remains of American soldiers killed in the Korean war \u2013 a longstanding US request that has so far produced only limited assistance. Trump was repeatedly asked after the summit about North Korea\u2019s appalling human rights record. He said he had raised the issue with Kim, but he defended the North Korean leader. \u201cWell, he is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough,\u201d the president said. \u201cI believe it is a rough situation over there. We will be doing something on it. It\u2019s rough. It\u2019s rough in a lot of places, by the way.\u201d During the leaders\u2019 public exchanges \u2013 a few months after the pair had swapped insults and threatened imminent war \u2013 they went out of their way to be gracious. Trump even declared it an \u201chonour\u201d to be sitting next to Kim. On his way back to the US, Trump tweeted that \u201cgreat progress\u201d had been made towards denuclearisation. \u201cAnyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make peace!\u201d he said.",
