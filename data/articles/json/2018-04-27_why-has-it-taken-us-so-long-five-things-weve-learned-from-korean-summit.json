    "content": "Reasons to be cheerful The mood of the summit appeared genuinely optimistic and the two leaders seemed to strike up a convivial relationship from the start. The first sign was Kim Jong-un\u2019s unscripted invitation for Moon Jae-in to step over to the North when they first met, apparently in response to Moon\u2019s question: \u201cWhen do I get to visit the North?\u201d They chatted throughout their walk to the House of Peace and were all smiles and handshakes inside as they got down to business. Their opening remarks were suitably epoch-making, talking about \u201cnew beginnings\u201d and a \u201cnew history\u201d. Kim even said that he wondered to himself while walking to the meeting \u201cwhy it had taken so long\u201d. Kim also told Moon that he was willing to visit him in Seoul \u201cany time if you invite me\u201d. 2. \u2018No more tests\u2019 Kim is reported to have promised Moon that there would be no more nuclear missile tests. \u201cI heard that you had early morning sleep disturbed many times because you had to attend the national security council meetings because of us,\u201d he told his counterpart from the South. \u201cI will make sure that your morning sleep won\u2019t be disturbed,\u201d he added in an apparent promise to stop the tests. It repeated a pledge he made when officials from the South visited Pyongyang earlier this year but it remains to be seen how firm the promise will turn out to be. 3. Kim\u2019s sister is his key ally Kim\u2019s sister, Kim Yo-jong, was by his side throughout as formalities were conducted at the House of Peace. She handed him a pen to sign a guestbook, she took the schoolchildren\u2019s flowers from his hand and sat next to him scribbling notes at the start of the talks with Moon. 4. The voice Although we\u2019ve heard Kim\u2019s speaking voice a few times in speeches, we\u2019ve never heard him in conversation until today. Kyung Bok-cho, a Bloomberg journalist, said Kim didn\u2019t sound like he had much of an accent and \u201cwouldn\u2019t sound that out of place in the middle of Seoul\u201d. Kim\u2019s smiling swagger as he walked towards Moon at the border also spoke volumes. 5. Tension remains Despite the upbeat feel, there\u2019s still a great deal of scepticism about what it all means for peace on the peninsula. Robert Kelly of Pusan national university in South Korea warned that Pyongyang \u201chasn\u2019t really changed, and it hasn\u2019t offered a meaningful concession yet\u201d, adding there were still \u201chuge\u201d strategic and political divisions between the North on one hand, and the South and the US on the other. \u201cWe have had false dawns before on the Korean peninsula,\u201d Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull warned rather gloomily. Donald Trump said overnight that he didn\u2019t even know if his proposed meeting with Kim \u201cwould even take place\u201d, so there was an unspoken focus on that future summit with neither Kim nor Moon saying anything about it. So, still tense times on the peninsula.",
