    "content": "Controversial comedy The Interview will be released on Christmas Day, reversing an earlier move by Sony to pull the film following a massive hack of the studio. Sony held a conference call with theatre owners on Tuesday and gave them the go ahead to release the movie in a limited number of independent cinemas. The decision came after President Barack Obama said Sony had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d pulling the movie following a campaign to kill the movie that the US government believes was organised by North Korea. \u201cWe have never given up on releasing The Interview and we are excited our movie will be in a number of theatres on Christmas day,\u201d said Michael Lynton, chairman &amp; CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment in a statement Tuesday. He said the company was exploring other ways to distribute the movie to the \u201clargest possible audience.\u201d Sony has been subject to a lengthy and embarrassing hack coordinated by a group calling itself Guardians of Peace (GOP). The hackers have released a slew of personal emails from Sony\u2019s top executives as well as compromising the personal details of 47,000 employees past and present. The comedy, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, depicts the assassination of North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-Un. It was pulled last week after GOP issued a threat against cinema goers. \u201cThe world will be full of fear\u201d, the message said. \u201cRemember the 11th of September 2001.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security subsequently reported there was \u201cno credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters within the United States.\u201d On Friday Obama said Sony should not have caved in to the threats. \u201cWe cannot have a society in which some dictator some place can start imposing censorship here in the United States because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing when they see a documentary that they don\u2019t like, or news reports that they don\u2019t like,\u201d he said. The White House applauded Sony\u2019s reversal on Tuesday. \u201cAs the president made clear, we are a country that believes in free speech, and the right of artistic expression,\u201d said deputy press spokesman Eric Schultz. \u201cThe decision made by Sony and participating theaters allows people to make their own choices about the film, and we welcome that outcome.\u201d Lynton told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria this weekend that Sony had no choice but to pull the film, and said that theaters had first decided not to show it. \u201cWe do not own movie theaters. We cannot determine whether or not a movie will be played in movie theaters,\u201d said Lynton. Tim League, founder of the Alamo Drafthouse cinema chain, first reported that Sony had authorised screenings via Twitter. The Plaza Cinema in Atlanta also said it would show the film. Art House Convergence, a national coalition of independent art house cinemas in the US, had petitioned Sony to allow independent exhibitors to show the film. \u201cWith this threat, the issue became larger than any film, larger than Sony and larger than the entertainment industry: societal and artistic values are in peril. We are at an important crossroads with an opportunity to reaffirm clearly our dedication to the value of freedom and the absolute necessity to keep our film industry free of restriction, censorship and violent intimidation,\u201d the group wrote to Sony. \u201cI want to thank our talent on The Interview and our employees, who have worked tirelessly through the many challenges we have all faced over the last month,\u201d Lynton said in his Tuesday statement. \u201cWhile we hope this is only the first step of the film\u2019s release, we are proud to make it available to the public and to have stood up to those who have attempted to suppress free speech.\u201d",
