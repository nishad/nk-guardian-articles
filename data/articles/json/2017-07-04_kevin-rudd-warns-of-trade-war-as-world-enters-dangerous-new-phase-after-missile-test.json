    "content": "Kevin Rudd has warned that the world is entering a dangerous new phase with North Korea\u2019s missile test potentially sparking US military action. Australia\u2019s former prime minister also foreshadowed the potential for a global trade war with Donald Trump considering tariffs on Chinese steel exports. Rudd said the move could spiral into escalating tariff action between nation states that could damage Australia badly. \u201cWe are entering into a dangerous new phase on the North Korea question and both US and Chinese diplomacy in relation to it,\u201d Rudd told ABC AM. He rated the test, carried out on US Independence Day, eight out of 10 for provocation to Trump. Rudd said the North Korean strategy was to get an intercontinental ballistic missile with a miniaturised warhead to act as a deterrent against the US and preserve its regime. He said the two US options were to use China to pressure the North Korea to stop its strategy or, if China failed, the US could \u201cthreaten or deliver\u201d a unilateral military strike to degrade or remove North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability. While the US had already urged China to pressure North Korea, Rudd said Trump\u2019s tweets suggested he had lost confidence in the China option. Trump is also considering plans to restrict imports of steel and aluminium by invoking a rarely used law from the cold war era. The US president could limit imports of goods deemed critical to national defence, a move which would satisfy the \u201cAmerica first\u201d promise in his election campaign. Rudd said it was still unclear whether the US would apply the tariffs to steel exports from China to the US. \u201cI think that is very much in flux at the moment but if it is implemented then the likelihood of retaliatory action could lead us in the direction of a trade war that is bad for the global economy and bad for Australia,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cWe are an economy highly dependent on the traded sector of our economy and therefore, once you take a hit to confidence in global trade period, as opposed to open trade and free trade is the norm, and it now entering into the economy of every nation state that we can take action and counteraction, tariff and counter tariff, it all heads in a very bad spiralling direction.\u201d Rudd urged Malcolm Turnbull to use the G20 in Hamburg this week to argue to keep trade open.",
