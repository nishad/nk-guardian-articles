    "content": "Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser said the US pulled out of a G7 communique because the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, \u201cstabbed us in the back\u201d and accused the leader of one America\u2019s most important allies of playing a \u201csophomoric political stunt for domestic consumption\u201d. In an extraordinary interview with CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, Larry Kudlow, who was present for negotiations at the G7 summit in Quebec over the weekend, said Trudeau had instigated \u201ca betrayal\u201d and was \u201cessentially double-crossing President Trump\u201d. Trudeau used a media conference on Saturday to reject a US demand for a sunset clause in the North American trade agreement, Nafta, that Trump has at different times pressed to abolish or renegotiate. The prime minister also said Canada would \u201cmove forward with retaliatory measures\u201d in response to the Trump administration\u2019s move to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. The move enraged Trump, who branded his Canadian counterpart \u201cdishonest and weak\u201d in a furious tweet, announcing the US would pull out of an agreed communique. The G7 communique said the leaders of seven of the most powerful countries in the world agreed on the need for \u201cfree, fair and mutually beneficial trade\u201d and the importance of fighting protectionism. Kudlow added that Trump had made the decision to pull out of the agreement in an attempt to save face ahead of his historic summit with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore. \u201cPotus [the president of the United States] is not going to let a Canadian prime minister push him around \u2013 push him, Potus around, on the eve of this,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cHe is not going to permit any show of weakness on the trip to negotiate with North Korea. Nor should he.\u201d Trump continued the onslaught against Trudeau on Monday, tweeting from Singapore. Trump\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro appeared on Fox News Sunday and said Trudeau deserved \u201ca special place in hell\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door, and that\u2019s what Bad Faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference,\u201d Navarro said, adding that his comments had come \u201cright from Air Force One\u201d. Kudlow, a staunch conservative who regularly pounded his fists on the desk throughout his interview on CNN, argued that Trudeau\u2019s comments were \u201ca great disservice to the whole G7\u201d. A representative of Trudeau did not respond to a request for comment but Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters in Quebec City: \u201cCanada does not conduct its diplomacy through ad hominem attacks \u2026 and we refrain particularly from ad hominem attacks when it comes from a close ally.\u201d Leaders of other G7 member states hit back at the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pull out of the joint statement. The office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, issued a statement saying cooperation on the international stage \u201ccannot be dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks\u201d. The statement continued: \u201cWe spend two days working out a [joint] statement and commitments. We are sticking to them and whoever reneges on them is showing incoherence and inconsistency.\u201d The office of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, published a suggestive photograph showing Trump surrounded by other leaders. German foreign minister Heiko Maas wrote on Twitter: \u201cYou can destroy an incredible amount of trust very quickly in a tweet. That makes it all the more important that Europe stands together and defends its interests even more offensively.\u201d Merkel later told ARD television: \u201cThe withdrawal, so to speak, via tweet is of course ... sobering and a bit depressing.\u201d Donald Tusk, president of the European council, sent a tweet in rebuke of Navarro\u2019s comment. There was \u201ca special place in heaven\u201d, Tusk said, for Trudeau, whom the former Polish prime minister thanked for the \u201cperfect organization\u201d of the summit. The Trump administration\u2019s move also received domestic criticism, from both moderate Republicans and Democrats. In a statement published on Twitter the Republican Arizona senator John McCain said: \u201cTo our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization &amp; supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn\u2019t.\u201d Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democratic senator from California, told CNN that \u201cto walk away from our allies in this way\u201d was \u201ca mistake\u201d. \u201c[The] rules-based international order is being challenged,\u201d she said.
