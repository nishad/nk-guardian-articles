    "content": "Boris Johnson has banned himself from using the phrase \u201cspecial relationship\u201d to describe Britain\u2019s longstanding links with the United States: it sounds, he says, \u201ca bit needy\u201d. But as Donald Trump\u2019s White House lurches from one crisis to the next \u2013 the latest being his remarks about migrants from \u201cshithole\u201d countries \u2013 Britain\u2019s foreign secretary has no intention of distancing himself from the controversial president. \u201cIt\u2019s a crucial relationship, and it\u2019s a very positive relationship,\u201d he enthuses, speaking to the Guardian on Monday morning over tea in the opulent surroundings of the Foreign Office, as he prepared to fly to Vancouver for an international meeting on North Korea. Hardly immune from the odd ill-chosen comment himself, Johnson adds that when he meets Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, at the summit, he will remind him of the open invitation for a state visit. \u201cI think that we will have a visit in due course,\u201d he says, adding that Guardian readers ready to pick up their placards and protest, \u201cshould understand that America, for better or worse, in our lifetimes, has incarnated values of liberty and fairness and freedom around the world, and it still does\u201d. Asked whether Trump represents those values, he adds: \u201cLet us have a grown-up conversation with our American friends about the things we want to do together.\u201d Johnson\u2019s shadow, Emily Thornberry, has described Trump as an \u201casteroid of awfulness\u201d; when Jeremy Corbyn was asked by ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on Sunday whether the relationship with the US was Britain\u2019s most important, he said, \u201cNo. I think there are many important relationships.\u201d But Johnson hits back: \u201cFor Jeremy Corbyn to say that this relationship doesn\u2019t matter, is I think insanity, and irresponsible. And to try to banish the president of the United States from visiting the UK when he\u2019s had trips to France, to Germany, to Japan, to China, is, I think, for the Labour party extremely odd.\u201d He has struck up a warm relationship with Tillerson (\u201cRex\u201d), and it is clear Johnson will be in Vancouver to back Tillerson\u2019s approach to North Korea, rather than validating Trump\u2019s twitter spats with Kim Jong-un. \u201cThe approach that Rex Tillerson has been taking has been entirely right, which is to build an international consensus,\u201d he says. \u201cKim Jong-un, the language that he has used: destroying not just parts of his neighbours but parts of the United States; his incipient ability to launch a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile \u2013 a threat of the kind the world has not known since the dawn of the atomic age. \u201cWe have a genuine possibility of a rogue state capable of nuclear blackmail and capable of nuclear destruction. I think that\u2019s something that we cannot ignore.\u201d He suggests China will have an important role to play in bringing North Korea in from the cold. \u201cIn the end, the people who can really solve the problem are the Chinese.\u201d He adds: \u201cI think one of the reasons for being optimistic about the world generally is, there are places around the world where you can see the Chinese ability to play a positive role in global diplomacy, and increasing Chinese interest in doing that.\u201d The shifting balance of diplomatic power is the stuff of high politics, of a kind that has long preoccupied the foreign secretaries who have occupied this vast, ornate office overlooking Horse Guards Parade. But today, Johnson also wants to talk about his latest preoccupation, which is on an altogether more domestic scale: advancing women\u2019s education around the world. \u201cI genuinely think, having done this job now for 18 months, having been to about 62 countries, having seen many of the problems of the world much more clearly than I ever saw them before, I really think that that is the number one challenge that we have \u2013 and also the biggest opportunity to transform the world,\u201d he says. He argues that providing girls with 12 years of good-quality education is \u201cthe Swiss army knife, the universal spanner\u201d to tackle a range of problems, from radicalisation to poverty \u2013 and in particular, population growth. \u201cYou open it up and it\u2019s got all the tools,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the evidence is that if you educate a girl in sub-Saharan Africa, broadly speaking, you will reduce the family size by roughly half \u2013 and that in the end is going to make a big, big difference to humanity.\u201d He brushes off the idea that by advocating women\u2019s education as a tool for tackling overpopulation, Britain could be accused of arrogance, or even neo-imperialism, saying, \u201cI think sometimes we\u2019ve got to be very frank about our ambitions.\u201d And he adds: \u201cIn societies where young men do not think of women as equals, they don\u2019t think of them as economic equals, they\u2019re more likely to be prone to ideas that I think are deeply damaging \u2013 radicalisation and all the rest of it.\u201d Global development is not formally part of Johnson\u2019s brief. Tony Blair created the Department for International Development in 1997 to prevent aid spending being used as a tool of Britain\u2019s foreign policy. But Johnson\u2019s department has long wanted to exert influence over DfID\u2019s considerably larger spending power. His may be one of the great offices of state, but spending cuts mean that by 2020-21, the Foreign Office budget is due to be almost a tenth that of DfID\u2019s. And with Brexit permanently branded on his political CV, Johnson is keen to show that he is a liberal internationalist, not a Little Englander \u2013 or, as some of his Conservative colleagues see him, a dilettante. The past two years have been bruising and strewn with missteps, from his fumbled remarks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British citizen imprisoned in Iran, to toting the Libyan city of Sirte as a potential tourist resort once they \u201cclear the dead bodies away\u201d. He says he is working closely with the new international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt \u2013 and Britain\u2019s push for women\u2019s education will involve both aid spending and diplomacy. \u201cWe are going to put it at the heart of everything we do, and we are campaigning for 12 years of quality education for every girl. That\u2019s the ambition. And it\u2019s the men who run the countries who are not doing enough to emphasise it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe already provide the funding for about a million girls, and we have various ambitions which we\u2019re going to announce at the Commonwealth summit in April. It\u2019s the 12-year plan at the heart of the Commonwealth summit, and we\u2019re trying to think of a logo. Twelve years is the strapline.\u201d",
