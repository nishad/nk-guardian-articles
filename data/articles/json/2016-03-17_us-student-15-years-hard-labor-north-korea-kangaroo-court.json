    "content": "The sentencing of 21-year-old US student Otto Warmbier to 15 years\u2019 hard labour in North Korea was \u201cunduly harsh\u201d, the US state department has said, as it called for his immediate release and experts denounced the country\u2019s legal process. Spokesman Mark Toner discouraged all US citizens from traveling to North Korea, a longstanding recommendation of the agency, citing the risk of \u201carrest and long-term detention for actions that would not be cause for arrest in the United States or other countries\u201d. The University of Virginia student\u2019s conviction on Wednesday was conducted before a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d, an expert has said. Katharine Moon from the Brookings Institute said: \u201cThere\u2019s no due process at all and everybody is handpicked by the regime ... They are not independent assessors of people\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d Warmbier, who was visiting the isolated communist nation with a backpacking tour group, was detained 2 January in Pyongyang for allegedly stealing a propaganda sign from a staff-only area of the hotel he was staying. State media said Warmbier\u2019s crime was committed with \u201cthe tacit connivance of the US government and under its manipulation\u201d. The court decided that Warbier had committed his crime \u201cpursuant to the US government\u2019s hostile policy toward [North Korea] in a bid to impair the unity of its people after entering it as a tourist\u201d. Pyongyang regularly accuses the US of sending operatives to North Korea for the purpose of overthrowing the hostile regime. Toner said a representative from the Swedish embassy in North Korea was able to confirm Warmbier was in good health and that members of the Swedish delegation were able to visit him in prison and were also present at his sentencing. In a televised statement in February, Warmbier offered an admission of guilt, saying his crime was \u201caimed at hurting the work ethic and the motivation of the Korean people\u201d. It is widely believed that this statement was coerced by North Korean authorities. Warmbier also claimed during his court appearance that he stole the sign under the direction of a woman from the Friendship United Methodist Church in Wyoming, Ohio, who offered him a used car worth $10,000 if he could return with the banner as a \u201ctrophy\u201d from North Korea. Church officials responded that they did not know the woman identified by Warmbier, adding that he was not a member of the congregation. The tour group operator, Young Pioneer Tours, said it was following the sentencing and suggested that the outcome \u201cshould be viewed in similar context of previous cases of Americans being sentenced in the DPRK\u201d. In November 2014 two Americans, Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller were released after receiving similar sentences for committing ostensibly minor crimes in the country. \u201cThis is what the North Koreans do,\u201d said Steven Weber, a professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cTheir repertoire is pretty limited, and they keep doing the same things to turn the temperature up.\u201d Weber said one of the political motivations of the act was likely the historic 2015 nuclear deal between the US and Iran, which leaves North Korea as the last remaining \u201crogue\u201d nuclear nation. \u201cThat\u2019s why you see that general ratcheting up of North Korea. They want to say \u2018we can still cause problems in the world too. Don\u2019t think you can now put pressure on us as a result of having now taken the Iran issue off the table\u2019.\u201d Moon said the big picture political game was clearly part of the psychology behind the detention and the sentence but added \u201cthere is no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind who understands North Korea that the officials are and were seriously upset about this kind of action\u201d, likening the removal of propaganda in a communist regime to stomping on a flag or spitting on a national monument. Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate John Kasich addressed the sentence Wednesday, calling it \u201can affront to concepts of justice\u201d and asking the Obama administration to \u201credouble its efforts to secure his release\u201d. Warmbier is an Ohio native and his family currently lives in the state. The University of Virginia, where Warmbier was studying before his detention, said it was \u201caware of the recent media reports regarding Otto Warmbier and remains in touch with his family\u201d, but university spokesperson Anthony de Bruyn said that no further comment would be made. Moon said if Warmbier is forced to actually serve the hard labor sentence, he will likely be tasked with work in rock quarries or agricultural work and would be facing near-starvation conditions of depravation. Moon also noted that Warmbier still might be treated better than the typical North Korean inmate. \u201cForeigners aren\u2019t usually housed in the same cells as regular North Koreans, and sometimes they are put in better, almost hotel-style places,\u201d Moon said. Warmbier\u2019s sentencing, first reported by China\u2019s Xinhua news agency, comes on the heels of a UN security council agreement on a new round of sanctions in response to the regime\u2019s recent nuclear test and rocket launch.",
