    "content": "Donald Trump vowed to \u201cfix the mess\u201d over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program a day after the country\u2019s foreign minister claimed that the US president had declared war in a tweet and threatened to shoot down American bombers in international airspace. Trump also said on Tuesday that any US military attack would be \u201cdevastating\u201d as his administration sought to turn up the economic pressure with fresh sanctions to punish North Korean banks and their workers. As the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said the US was still hoping for a diplomatic resolution, Trump echoed the sentiment, declaring that a military strike was \u201cnot a preferred option\u201d. Still, Trump said the US was \u201ctotally prepared\u201d to pursue that route if necessary. \u201cIf we take that option, it will be devastating, I can tell you that. Devastating,\u201d Trump said in a White House news conference. \u201cIf we have to take it, we will.\u201d The president appeared eager to push back on the notion that it was he, not the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who was responsible for upping the rhetoric between the countries to alarming levels. And he assigned some fault for the mounting crisis to his predecessors for failing to address the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions over many decades. \u201cIt\u2019s left me a mess,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ll fix the mess.\u201d The comments came after the president faced scrutiny for tweeting over the weekend that Kim \u201cwon\u2019t be around much longer\u201d, prompting his administration to clarify that the US was not seeking to overthrow the North Korean leader. Following Trump\u2019s earlier insults, Kim had said last week he was considering retaliating at the \u201chighest level\u201d and called the president a \u201cmentally deranged US dotard\u201d who would \u201cpay dearly\u201d for threatening to destroy his regime. Trump emphasized that countries must act quickly to \u201censure the regime\u2019s complete denuclearization\u201d, referring to Kim\u2019s government. Though the US has continued to argue publicly that North Korea should give up its nuclear program, US officials and North Korea experts have said that halting or rolling back Pyongyang\u2019s program is the more realistic outcome. Trump spoke alongside Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, minutes after the US treasury announced new sanctions targeting eight North Korean banks and 26 bank workers living abroad. The North Korean targets mark the first use of new sanctioning powers that Trump created in an executive order he signed last week to target North Korea\u2019s access to the international banking system. They also come as the United Nations has recently passed its toughest sanctions package targeting North Korea. The eight banks are in North Korea. The treasury department said the 26 individuals were North Korean nationals employed by those banks. Nineteen of them live in China; three live in Russia and two each in Libya and the United Arab Emirates. \u201cThis is a clear message to Chinese banks: we can find these individuals, so can you,\u201d said Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which argues for tough sanctions on North Korea. Trump\u2019s executive order, signed last week as world leaders attended the UN general assembly, also created a pathway for the US to impose so-called secondary sanctions on banks in third countries that do legitimate business with North Korea. Those sanctions would essentially force those banks, mostly in China, to stop doing business with North Korea or lose all access to the US financial system. The penalties are part of a Trump administration effort to show it remains committed to using economic pressure and diplomacy to resolve the North Korea nuclear crisis, rather than the military threat that Trump has repeatedly issued. \u201cWe are targeting North Korean banks and financial facilitators acting as representatives for North Korean banks across the globe,\u201d said the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. A spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry said it strongly disapproved of the \u201cescalating war of rhetoric\u201d between Washington and Pyongyang. Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing: \u201cWe hope that the statesmen from both the US and the DPRK [North Korea] \u2026 can also come to recognise that being bent on assertiveness and provoking each other will only increase the risk of confrontation and conflict and reduce the room for their own policy manoeuvers. \u201cWar on the Korean peninsula will produce no winners and it will even bring misfortune to regional countries.\u201d Hu Xijin, the editor of the nationalistic Global Times tabloid, blamed Trump for the war of words. Hu said: \u201cPyongyang cannot just take his words as empty threats. Pyongyang believes a US military attack is imminent \u2026 the country is truly anxious. \u201cPerhaps Trump sees his threats the same way he sees criticizing an NFL player. But what we see are grave errors in judgement.\u201d",
