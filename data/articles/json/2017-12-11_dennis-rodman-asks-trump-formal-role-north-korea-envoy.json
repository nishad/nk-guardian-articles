    "content": "Dennis Rodman, the American basketball star turned freelance diplomat , has urged Donald Trump to sign him up as a peace envoy to North Korea after his latest foray into Kim Jong-un\u2019s hermit kingdom was scuppered by a travel ban preventing US citizens from visiting. During an interview in Beijing, from where Rodman had hoped to fly to Pyongyang for his sixth trip there, the former NBA star said US officials had discouraged him from doing so amid continuing tensions between the countries. \u201cBasically they said it\u2019s not a good time right now,\u201d he said. A state department ban on US passport holders visiting North Korea came into force on 1 September after the death of Otto Warmbier, an American student who was detained in Pyongyang for more than a year. On 29 November, North Korea celebrated its latest intercontinental ballistic missile test, claiming it could now strike anywhere on the US mainland. However, Rodman, who first visited North Korea in 2013 and calls Kim his friend, claimed that now was the perfect time \u2013 and he was the perfect man \u2013 to press for peace. \u201cIf I can go back over there \u2026 you\u2019ll see me talking to him, and sitting down and having dinner, a glass of wine, laughing and doing my thing. I guess things will settle down a bit and everybody can rest at ease.\u201d Rodman, 56, added: \u201cI think a lot of people around the world \u2026 want me to go just to see if I can do something.\u201d The 6ft 7in former sportsman, who calls the North Korean dictator \u201cthe Marshal\u201d, said it was far-fetched to imagine Kim and Trump one day sitting down for a beer, but \u201ca 30-second conversation\u201d was feasible. Rodman said he had been seeking Trump\u2019s ear on North Korea for months. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell Donald since day one: \u2018Come talk to me, man \u2026 I\u2019ll tell you what the Marshal wants more than anything \u2026 It\u2019s not even that much.\u2019\u201d However, when the Guardian inquired as to what the Marshal wanted, Rodman was tight-lipped: \u201cI ain\u2019t telling you \u2026 I will tell him [Trump] when I see him.\u201d Despite claiming that Kim is a \u201cfriend for life\u201d, there is little evidence Rodman has the North Korean leader\u2019s ear when it comes to affairs of state. Kim appears to view the retired athlete as a benign outsider, someone to whom he can present a gentler image of himself as a lover of basketball and horses, safe in the knowledge that this is the image that will circulate around the world as soon as Rodman returns home. On Monday, Rodman painted Kim as a Frank Sinatra fan and said Kim had asked him to write a book about Kim\u2019s life. Rodman said he was considering calling it The Middleman (\u201cThat\u2019s me\u201d). The pair appear to have formed an unlikely bond during skiing trips and karaoke sessions, but on some of Rodman\u2019s five previous visits the pair have not met, including on his most recent, in June this year. Rodman admits that he has shied away from sensitive political subjects, to the anger of rights groups that accuse him of lending credibility to one of the world\u2019s cruellest dictatorships. \u201cI don\u2019t even try to think about [the bad things],\u201d he said. Trump has not commented on Rodman\u2019s North Korean travels but in 2013 hailed his visit that year as \u201csmart\u201d. \u201cThe world is blowing up around us. Maybe Dennis is a lot better than what we have,\u201d he said.",
