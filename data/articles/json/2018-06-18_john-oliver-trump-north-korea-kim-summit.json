    "content": "On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed the historic summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un and the former\u2019s deference to the North Korean dictator. \u201cWe begin tonight with Donald Trump, president of the United States and the love of Melania\u2019s life,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cTrump had himself a bit of and up-and-down time this week. \u201cOn the downside,\u201d Oliver explained, \u201chis former lawyer Michael Cohen sought new counsel, prompting many to speculate he\u2019s about to flip on Trump. Now why would he do that? I think a random New Yorker probably expressed it best.\u201d In footage of Cohen walking around in Manhattan, a passerby yelled: \u201cHey! It\u2019s that guy that\u2019s going to jail. Awesome. Way to go, bud.\u201d Oliver continued: \u201cTrump\u2019s week actually began with the eyes of the world upon him as he met with this cutie-patootie for a historic summit, and if you listen to Trump it was a huge success.\u201d In a tweet sent after the summit in Singapore, Trump said \u201ceverybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office\u201d and declared \u201cthere is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump telling me I can sleep well tonight is like the Grim Reaper telling me to have a happy birthday,\u201d Oliver quipped. \u201cHis presence is the reason I will not.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, the deal Trump made with Kim Jong-un was pretty underwhelming,\u201d the host went on. \u201cThey agreed to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which isn\u2019t just ambiguous compared to the multiple previous agreements involving North Korea, it\u2019s also close to meaningless.\u201d What America got out of the deal was akin to what Oliver called an \u201cice cream blowjob \u2026 something that sounds great but, when you really think about it, isn\u2019t actually anything\u201d. Oliver continued: \u201cThe genuinely remarkable thing about the summit was the deference that Trump happily showed to his counterpart. Diplomacy always involves a certain amount of sucking up to horrible people, but Trump went above and beyond.\u201d In an interview with Greta Van Susteren after the summit, Trump extolled the North Korean leader, saying he has a \u201cgreat personality\u201d, is a \u201cgreat negotiator\u201d, is \u201cfunny\u201d, \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cloves his people\u201d. \u201cQuickly, on that,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cNo he doesn\u2019t, no he isn\u2019t, no he\u2019s not, no he isn\u2019t, no he doesn\u2019t, and that\u2019s not why he\u2019s doing it. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that part of Trump\u2019s admiration for Kim is that he wishes he could be a dictator as well,\u201d Oliver added. \u201cI\u2019m going to let him say that.\u201d The host then showed footage from an interview Trump gave to Fox &amp; Friends on the White House lawn, in which he called Kim a \u201cstrong head\u201d of state and said: \u201cHe speaks and his people sit up at attention, I want my people to do the same.\u201d Oliver said: \u201cThat is the president of the United States expressing a wish that people would model themselves after the malnourished population of North Korea.\u201d",
