    "content": "Prospects for nuclear disarmament are \u201cbleak\u201d under the current non-proliferation treaty, Australian diplomats have conceded in cables back to Canberra, but the country will resist growing global support for a new treaty banning nuclear weapons because of a dependence on the nuclear deterrent capability of the US. A tranche of internal government emails from within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reveals Australia\u2019s opposition to a 116-nation push to ban nuclear weapons is leaving it increasingly isolated globally, and especially among anti-nuclear neighbours. The emails, released under freedom of information, reveal Australia is increasingly worried about an Austrian-led push for a treaty to ban all nuclear weapons. \u201cLike the US, Australia is worried about the Austrian pledge,\u201d a Dfat note says. Other cables to Canberra described the pledge as \u201ca not-too-subtle attempt to build momentum for negotiations on a nuclear weapons ban treaty\u201d but also reported that \u201cthe Austrian pledge is fast becoming a galvanising focus for those pushing the ban treaty option\u201d. Australia says it needs the protection of the deterrent effect of the US\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the second largest in the world. \u201cAs long as nuclear weapons exist, Australia will continue to rely on US nuclear forces to deter nuclear attack on Australia,\u201d a Dfat briefing note says. At a global conference in December last year, the so-called \u201chumanitarian pledge\u201d, proposed by Austria, called for an international treaty banning nuclear weapons, asking nations to cooperate \u201cin efforts to stigmatise, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons in light of their unacceptable humanitarian consequences\u201d. The Austrian pledge, which 116 countries \u2013 most of the world\u2019s nations \u2013 have endorsed, proposes to \u201cfill the legal gap of the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons\u201d. The pledge has also attracted the support of pope Francis, who said the \u201cimmoral\u201d weapons should be \u201cbanned once and for all\u201d, and nine Nobel peace laureates who signed a declaration urging \u201call states to commence negotiations on a treaty to ban nuclear weapons at the earliest possible time\u201d. The mechanism for disarmament is chapter VI of the non-proliferation treaty (NPT), which obliges the five declared nuclear states to \u201cpursue negotiations in good faith\u201d towards \u201ccessation of the nuclear arms race \u2026 and nuclear disarmament\u201d. But the disarmament \u201cpillar\u201d of the treaty is widely regarded as having failed. While the superpowers are slowly reducing their stockpiles, they are, at the same time, working to develop new weapons systems or upgrade existing ones. India, Pakistan and North Korea have increased their nuclear stockpiles in recent years, and their weapons fall outside the treaty because they are not members. Nor is Israel, whose nuclear status is undeclared but is believed to have about 80 warheads. In cables back to Canberra, Australian diplomats have highlighted the weaknesses in the non-proliferation treaty process. In a briefing prepared for the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, officials concede \u201cprospects are bleak for meaningful progress in multilateral arms control\u201d. And they warn Bishop that the failure of the last round of treaty talks to reach consensus \u201cwill embolden those arguing that the current disarmament machinery is broken and that a nuclear weapons ban treaty must be negotiated outside the NPT\u201d. Australia has found it is particularly isolated in regional security meetings. At a meeting of Asia Pacific nations on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons and prospects for a ban treaty, Australia was \u201cthe lone voice in the room on many issues\u201d. Briefing notes say Australia supports practical, realistic measures for nuclear disarmament, but dismisses \u201csimplistic approaches which ignore the security dimensions\u201d. Suggested \u201ctalking points\u201d for government ministers say \u201ceffective disarmament can only be achieved by engaging all the nuclear-armed states; simply banning nuclear weapons would not lead to their elimination\u201d. \u201cAs long as the threat of nuclear attack or coercion exists, and countries like the DPRK [North Korea] seek these weapons and threaten others, Australia and many other countries will continue to rely on US extended nuclear deterrence.\u201d Prof Ramesh Thakur, director of the centre for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament at the Australian National University, said Australian diplomats had underestimated support for the humanitarian pledge. \u201cWhat is really clear from these cables, but not explicitly stated, is that Australian officials have been very surprised, they have been taken aback, by the strength of support for the humanitarian consequences pledge, and they are scrambling to explain that. \u201cSupport for the humanitarian consequences pledge is making Australia\u2019s position more difficult; it is galvanising public and political opinion, and Australia finds itself running against the domestic and international tide.\u201d Thakur said Australia\u2019s earlier leadership on nuclear disarmament had diminished over the past four years. \u201cWe know what Australia is saying \u2018no\u2019 to. It is saying \u2018no\u2019 to the humanitarian consequences pledge. Well, what is it saying \u2018yes\u2019 to?\u201d \u201cWe all share the so-called realistic practical agenda they identify with respect to the fissile material cut-off treaty and comprehensive test ban treaty. But the reality is all such efforts have been stalemated and frustrated for years now, hence the interest in new ways to generate momentum towards real progress instead of more rhetoric.\u201d The FOI request that revealed the government correspondence was made by the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons (Ican), a coalition of NGOs from more than 95 countries, whose aim is a global ban on nuclear weapons. Ican\u2019s Asia-Pacific director, Tim Wright, told Guardian Australia the humanitarian pledge had developed an international momentum, and he was confident it would lead to new global negotiations towards outlawing nuclear weapons. The Australian government\u2019s argument that it required the protection of a foreign power\u2019s nuclear weapons was \u201ca long-held belief that has gone unchallenged\u201d. \u201cNuclear weapons undermine safety, they do not enhance it,\u201d Wright said. And a proposed ban treaty was not designed to replace the non-proliferation treaty. \u201cThe NPT remains relevant, and will for the foreseeable future, as the only treaty with a legally binding commitment towards disarmament. But we see a ban treaty as something not to replace the NPT, but as something to complement and strengthen it, like the comprehensive test ban treaty did in the 1990s.\u201d The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did not respond to inquiries about the cables from Guardian Australia.",
