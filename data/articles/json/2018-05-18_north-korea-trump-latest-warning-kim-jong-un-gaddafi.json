    "content": "Donald Trump has threatened Kim Jong-un with the same fate as Muammar Gaddafi if the North Korean leader \u201cdoesn\u2019t make a deal\u201d on his nuclear weapons programme. The US president issued the threat at the White House when he was asked about the recent suggestion by his national security adviser, John Bolton, that the \u201cLibyan model\u201d be a template for dealing with North Korea at a summit between Trump and Kim planned for 12 June in Singapore. The model Bolton was referring to was Gaddafi\u2019s agreement in December 2003 to surrender his embryonic nuclear weapons programme, which included allowing his uranium centrifuges to be shipped out to the US. But Trump appeared to be unaware of that agreement, and interpreted the \u201cLibyan model\u201d to mean the 2011 Nato intervention in Libya in support of an insurrection, which ultimately led to Gaddafi\u2019s murder at the hands of rebels in Tripoli. \u201cThe model, if you look at that model with Gaddafi, that was a total decimation. We went in there to beat him. Now that model would take place if we don\u2019t make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy,\u201d Trump said, suggesting that the regime\u2019s survival could be assured if Kim agreed to disarm. \u201cThis with Kim Jong-un would be something where he would be there. He would be running his country. His country would be very rich,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to do a lot, and he\u2019s willing \u2026 to do a lot also, and I think we\u2019ll actually have a good relationship, assuming we have the meeting and assuming something comes of it. And he\u2019ll get protections that will be very strong.\u201d Asked whether his comments meant that he disagreed with his national security adviser, the third of his administration, the president said: \u201cI think when John Bolton made that statement, he was talking about if we are going to be having a problem, because we cannot let that country have nukes. We just can\u2019t do it.\u201d Joel Wit, a former US negotiator who is now a senior fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said: \u201cThis is probably the wrong time to be making threats, three weeks before the summit.\u201d The inflammatory comments come at a time when the June meeting is in doubt. The regime in Pyongyang reacted strongly against statements by Bolton over the weekend, who insisted North Korea would have to dismantle its nuclear arsenal completely and immediately. A senior official said on Wednesday that Kim would not take part in a summit with such \u201cone-sided\u201d goals. Pyongyang has also complained about joint military exercises being conducted by US and South Korean forces. The regime\u2019s mission to the United Nations issued a statement on Thursday claiming that nuclear-capable B-52 bombers and F-22 fighter planes were taking part in the exercises. He described it as \u201can extremely provocative and ill-boding act\u201d. However, Trump said that despite Pyongyang\u2019s threats to call off the summit, \u201cthey\u2019ve been negotiating like nothing happened\u201d. The state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said: \u201cWe are continuing to push ahead and plan our preparations. Those continue at this time for a meeting between the president and Kim Jong-un in June.\u201d At a meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday, a senior state department official suggested that a substantial but partial disarmament by North Korea might be acceptable as the first stage of a deal with North Korea. Speaking to a meeting of business executives in Tokyo organised by the Wall Street Journal, Susan Thornton, the acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, said that in Kim\u2019s conversations with South Korean officials, he had said \u201cthere will be a big downpayment, a big up-front demonstration of his intention\u201d to dismantle the North Korean nuclear weapons programme completely. \u201cThe question is: what could be front-loaded in a process that\u2019s inevitably going to go on for some time? And then what would be acceptable to the North Korean side in return for that front-loading?\u201d Thornton said. It was unclear whether Thornton\u2019s remarks had been coordinated with Bolton, who has suggested that North Korea would have to dismantle its nuclear weapons completely before receiving any benefits. Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America thinktank who has played a lead role in back-channel talks with North Korea, said: \u201cGiven the high degree of distrust between Pyongyang and Washington, anything short of a phased approach with confidence measures built in along the way is pure fantasy.\u201d",
