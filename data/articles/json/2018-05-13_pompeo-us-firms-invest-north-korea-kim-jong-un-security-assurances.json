    "content": "The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said on Sunday that if North Korea agrees to fully dismantle its nuclear weapons program, the Trump administration will allow the American private sector to invest in the country. Pompeo also hinted that the US might assure Kim Jong-un he can stay in power after any deal. If a deal is reached at or after the summit meeting between Kim and Trump scheduled for Singapore on 12 June, Pompeo said on Fox News Sunday, \u201cprivate sector Americans, not the US taxpayer\u201d could \u201chelp build out the energy grid that needs enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea\u201d. Americans could also help, he said, with investment in infrastructure and agriculture to help feed the North Korean people. Appearing on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Pompeo floated the possibility of \u201csanctions relief\u201d, a remark that jarred a little with a comment by Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser. John Bolton told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t look for economic aid from us.\u201d Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator, said private investment or sanctions relief for the North would \u201cbe the best money we ever spent\u201d. Graham, a member of the Senate armed services committee, told CBS \u201cthere\u2019d be a lot of support in Congress to give North Korea a better life. Provide aid, relieve sanctions with one condition: that you give up your nuclear weapons program in a verifiable way.\u201d He also said \u201cthe average North Korean is about three inches shorter than \u2026 their neighbours in South Korea because of the terrible conditions in North Korea\u201d. Studies have concluded that such a height difference does indeed exist. Pompeo met Kim last week in North Korea, for the second time, helping set the stage for the summit and securing the release of three Americans who the Pentagon said left hospital on Sunday. Asked if the US was in effect telling Kim \u201cregime change will be off the table\u201d if he meets American demands, Pompeo told Fox: \u201cWe will have to provide security assurances, to be sure.\u201d Pompeo did not elaborate, but North Korea has sought assurances before. A statement issued during negotiations in 2005 said the \u201cUnited States affirmed that it has no nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula and has no intention to attack or invade [North Korea] with nuclear or conventional weapons\u201d. The North has said it needs nuclear weapons to counter a US effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government. \u201cMake no mistake about it, America\u2019s interest here is preventing the risk that North Korea will launch a nuclear weapon into LA or Denver or to the very place we\u2019re sitting here this morning,\u201d Pompeo said, from Washington. \u201cThat\u2019s our objective, that\u2019s the end state the president has laid out and that\u2019s the mission that he sent me on this past week, to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that.\u201d Trump hailed progress with North Korea on Twitter on Saturday, writing: \u201cNorth Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month, ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th. Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture!\u201d Pompeo told Fox the North\u2019s promise to destroy the site was \u201cgood news. Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk upon the American people that is destroyed, eliminated, dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world.\u201d The secretary rejected suggestions that Trump\u2019s praise of Kim and claims of success have been made too soon. \u201cThe president can have a successful outcome,\u201d Pompeo said, \u201cthat the two of them can meet and see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people.\u201d Pompeo was asked if in his talks with Kim he had discussed his previous exchange of insults with Trump, in which the US president coined the nickname \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d for a leader who in return called him a \u201cmentally deranged US dotard\u201d. \u201cWe didn\u2019t cover that,\u201d Pompeo said.",
