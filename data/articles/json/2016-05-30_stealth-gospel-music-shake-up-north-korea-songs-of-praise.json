    "content": "From giant balloons and illicit DVDs to portable media players, campaigners have been extremely persistent in finding ways to smuggle information inside North Korea. But \u201cstealth gospel\u201d, whereby adoring references to the ruling Kim dynasty in classical propaganda music are replaced with mentions of Jesus and the Holy Spirit, must be one of the most creative. No Chain, a project initiated by former North Korean political prisoner Jung Gwang-il, has recorded 32 new songs almost identical to the ones played on state-run radio \u2013 but with a twist. \u201cIt sounds exactly the same as what you would hear in North Korea, the same accompaniment, the same type of voice, but the names have all been changed,\u201d Jung said. \u201c[The customs officials] aren\u2019t going to sit there and listen to each song, because the music sounds the same to what they\u2019re used to hearing,\u201d he added. No Chain uses its network of smugglers along the China-DPRK border to distribute the music, which is secretly loaded on USB sticks and SD cards. They do so at great risk: the penalty if they\u2019re caught is public execution. Jung, who presented the project at the Oslo Freedom Forum recently, was stressed that his aim was not to proselytise. Instead, he said he was using religion as a way to expose North Korea\u2019s isolated citizens to alternative ways of thinking. \u201cIn the DPRK there is no concept of love that isn\u2019t about loyalty and love for the regime and the \u2018dear leader\u2019. We\u2019ve done this to show that outside, people believe in whatever they want,\u201d he said. Jung hired a music studio, a producer, and enlisted the help of a defector who used to work as a singer in Pyongyang. \u201cWe took great pains to reproduce the exact sound \u2013 the singing, the intonation, the methods,\u201d Jung said. But it\u2019s also about bringing a bit of cheer. Testing the songs on fellow defectors in the US, Jung says: \u201cThey hear the words and they\u2019re like, \u2018what the hell?\u2019, chuckling and laughing. They\u2019re so surprised.\u201d Pop attrition Music is a well-worn battleground in North Korea\u2019s ongoing fight to control the hearts and minds of its citizens. Patriotic songs celebrating the \u201cexploding mental strength of our million citizens\u201d are a regular fixture of state-run radio and TV, with Kim even announcing his own theme tune in 2012 and founding his own all-female pop group. But it\u2019s also increasingly being used to expose isolated citizens to the outside world \u2013 and incense the regime. Following a nuclear test in January, Pyongyang declared it had been driven to \u201cthe brink of war\u201d by a barrage of pop music being pumped across the demilitarised zone by a fleet of loudspeakers installed by South Koreans. A spokesman for the South Korean defence ministry said they had been careful to choose \u201ca diverse range of the most recent popular hits to make it interesting\u201d, including a selection of catchy K-pop tracks. The international community responded to Kim\u2019s provocation with a new sanctions, but analysts say these measures continually fail to deter the regime and instead further alienate average citizens. Writing in the Guardian, Korea specialist Andrei Lankov argued that \u201ceven if sanctions were to inflict damage on the North Korean economy \u2013 which has exceptionally low dependence on foreign trade \u2013 the only victims will be common North Koreans, who will just suffer more.\u201d For Jung, who started out by smuggling seeds for Doctors Without Borders in 2008, these measures have made smuggling music, foreign films and TV programmes all the more important, thanks to their power to act as a subversive force against the regime\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cDramas and Hollywood action films may be classified as entertainment, but when we send them to North Korea, where people are living lives of forced labour, they realise that others don\u2019t have to focus only on working to survive,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt may be simple entertainment, but it has a profound impact.\u201d",
