    "content": "Barnaby Joyce has said the government would have \u201csympathy\u201d with US trade sanctions against China for \u201caiding and abetting\u201d North Korea. Asked if Australia would support trade sanctions against China, which is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, the deputy prime minister said: \u201cWe obviously have sympathy.\u201d Joyce accused North Korea of an \u201covert program of destablising and creating an incredible threat\u201d to the region. \u201cIf people want to aid and abet that threat of the North Korean leadership, well obviously we can\u2019t be supporting them,\u201d Joyce said. His comments come after Donald Trump attacked China\u2019s trade ties with North Korea following the rogue state\u2019s successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, described the missile launch as a \u201cclear and sharp military escalation\u201d and warned that North Korea\u2019s actions were \u201cquickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution\u201d. China is Australia\u2019s largest two-way trading partner, with goods and services valued at $150bn in 2015-16. The Coalition government only completed a free-trade agreement with China in December 2015. The shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, described the comments as \u201cutterly irresponsible\u201d. \u201cWhat he needs to recognise is that the empty threats he makes would only serve to punish and harm Australian businesses, Australian exporters, including agriculture, and damage Australian jobs,\u201d Wong said. She ruled out applying trade sanctions because it would be an \u201cown goal\u201d given Australia\u2019s dependency on China. \u201cChina has an interest in global peace, China has an interest in a stable region and let\u2019s recall, China has an interest in being a constructive player in the global framework,\u201d Wong said. \u201c[Joyce] really needs to start thinking before he speaks when it comes to Australian foreign policy and Australian trade policy.\u201d Joyce said military instability as a result of North Korean military action would be a far bigger threat to the Australian and Chinese economies than trade sanctions. \u201cThe trade sanctions would pale into insignificance against what would happen if North Korea continues down this path because, if North Korea was to make a mistake in one of their launches, that\u2019s all they have to do, they don\u2019t even have to deliver a weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cThey only have to make a mistake and drop one of their missiles \u2013 I imagine into South Korea or on to Japan \u2013 then the economic plan for China, the economic plan for south-east Asia would cease that moment. \u201cIt would be devastating for global economics and absolutely devastating for Chinese economics.\u201d Joyce said the United States would not allow a rogue national leader to develop a nuclear bomb that could reach both the US and Australia. \u201cThe economic prosperity of China, of south-east Asia, is inextricably linked to peace in that area and the greatest risk to peace in that area is North Korea,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point having a One Belt One Road policy if the whole place descends into a morass of dysfunctionality that would occur if North Korea continues down this path. It would be the biggest economic threat to China without a shadow of a doubt, the biggest economic threat to their economy.\u201d The Coalition is stepping up its language on China, with Malcolm Turnbull on Wednesday urging China to take the \u201cstrongest action\u201d against North Korea. Joyce would not disclose whether the national security committee had discussed North Korea. Joyce also urged the Labor party to get behind the Adani Carmichael coalmine in the Galilee Basin after the news that the London-based group GFG Alliance had signed a binding agreement to buy the entire operations of steelmaker Arrium, including the Whyalla steelworks. Adani has committed to a $73m deal with Arrium to provide steel for the railway line to take the Carmichael coal to port, a line for which Adani is seeking a $1bn government loan through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund. Asked if the Adani deal was a factor in GFG Alliance\u2019s offer to buy Arrium, Joyce said: \u201cIt stands to make sense that you have got to see the steelmaker producing steel and someone actually buying it and Arrium has that.\u201d",
