    "content": "North Korea\u2019s claims to have detonated a powerful hydrogen bomb have been met with scepticism by nuclear experts, but definitive proof either way will have to wait until winds have carried particles from the blast across the country\u2019s borders. Lassina Zerbo, the head of the international commission monitoring nuclear tests, described those particles as a potential \u201csmoking gun\u201d identifying a nuclear test and said he expected that, if present, they could be detected within two or three days by the organisation\u2019s monitoring stations in Japan, Russia and elsewhere in the region. Zerbo added it was quite possible that US planes could take air samples before then, as happened after North Korea\u2019s tests in 2009 and 2013. Such samples could determine whether the Pyongyang regime really did test a hydrogen bomb, as it claimed. The question is important as an H-bomb \u2013 a shorthand term for a thermonuclear device \u2013 would mark a technological leap forward from the atomic bombs it has experimented with so far, and an exponential leap in the country\u2019s destructive capacity. A thermonuclear weapon, which uses fission and fusion in a two-stage blast, can be over a thousand times more powerful than an atomic bomb, which depends only on fission. A third alternative is a hybrid, known as a boosted fission device, in which the yield of an orthodox atomic bomb is increased by the addition of small amounts of hydrogen isotopes, such as deuterium and tritium, that undergo fusion. However, even that would be expected to increase the power of the blast many times over, and the initial signs from the seismic readings of Pyongyang\u2019s latest test was that it was roughly of the same order as its last, which was generally assessed to be under 10 kilotons. \u201cIt is close to what happened in 2013. I think they are pretty similar in terms of location, magnitude and so forth,\u201d said Zerbo, who is executive secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation, based in Vienna, which monitors suspected tests while seeking to rally international support to bring the test ban into force. \u201cTo confirm if an event is nuclear we need the smoking gun which is the radio isotopes that are released from a blast. We have a network of stations and the winds will blow the venting to our stations. We have some stations in Japan, in Russia and in the vicinity and those stations may be able to pick up something in the next 48 or 72 hours.\u201d It is not in the CBTO commission\u2019s mandate to determine what kind of weapon has been tested, but scientists should be able to determine whether a hydrogen bomb was involved on the basis of which radionuclides are picked up. In 2013, it took 50 days for such particles to be detected but analysts are hopeful confirmation of this blast will come sooner as the US Geological Survey estimated that the suspected test was close to the surface. David Albright, the head of the Institute for Science and International Security, Washington DC, wrote: \u201cOn balance, it is not believed that North Korea tested a two-stage H-bomb.\u201d \u201cIf North Korea had indeed tested this type of H-bomb, the device\u2019s yield would be expected to be many tens of kilotons, at least. However, the need to contain the underground explosion and prevent radioactive releases from its test site may have led North Korea to limit the yield of this test device,\u201d Albright said. \u201cNonetheless, the explosive yield of a two-stage H-Bomb test would have been expected to be far higher than reported so far. Second, the development of a two-stage thermonuclear weapon is very challenging. It is assessed as beyond North Korea\u2019s capabilities at this stage.\u201d Albright said it was possible that the Pyongyang regime had tested a \u201cone-stage thermonuclear\u201d device, which involved inserting a solid tablet of lithium, deuterium and tritium into the core of a fission weapon. \u201cNonetheless, the yield of a North Korean test of a one-stage thermonuclear device would also be expected to have been larger than reported so far,\u201d he concluded. Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Programme at the Monterrey Institute of International Studies, said that trying to estimate the yield of a nuclear blast from seismic readings left a wide margin for error. He said: \u201cThis is likely too small for a classic staged thermonuclear weapon but large enough that North Korea might have boosted the primary with deuterium-tritium or included a blanket of thermonuclear material like lithium-6.\u201d Zerbo said the best way for the international community to put pressure on North Korea, or any other states contemplating new nuclear tests, is for countries who have so far not ratified the comprehensive test ban to join the treaty. Twenty years after the test ban treaty was adopted by the UN, there are still eight states who must join for it to become legally binding. Five of those \u2013 the US, Iran, Israel, Egypt and China \u2013 have signed but not ratified it. Another three \u2013 North Korea, India and Pakistan \u2013 have not signed it. \u201cThese eight countries should show leadership to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Zerbo said. \u201cWe need people to work on this issue. We don\u2019t want to see more tests before people think this treaty is important. The only way to stop this is to make it legally binding. I hope this will be the last wake-up call to the international community to act on this treaty.\u201d",
