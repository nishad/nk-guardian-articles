    "content": "The world's leading stem cell scientist, Woo-suk Hwang, yesterday denied allegations of falsifying data, but asked the US journal Science to withdraw one of his research papers because of errors contained in it. The South Korean, who last year cloned the first human embryo, was accused of fabricating data by a co-author on the paper, Roh Sung-il. The study purported to show that the team had created stem cells for 11 patients with medical conditions, raising hopes for new therapies. Dr Hwang cited \"fatal errors and loopholes in reporting the scientific accomplishment\".",
