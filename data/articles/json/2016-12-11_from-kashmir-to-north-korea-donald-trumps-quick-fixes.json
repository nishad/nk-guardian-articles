    "content": "The president-elect is about to step onto a world stage more complex and fraught with danger than most living souls can remember. But he\u2019s Donald Trump! No job is too big for the reality TV star turned leader of the free world, no region too screwed. And he has already hinted at how quickly he will fix some of the trickiest files in his foreign in-tray. Tremendous! North Korea Trump started his delicate handling of Pyongyang\u2019s growing nuclear threat last February, when he said he would \u201cget China to make [Kim Jong-un] disappear\u201d. \u201cI mean, this guy\u2019s a bad dude, and don\u2019t underestimate him,\u201d he added. But, apart from one oblique reference to North Korea after his big meeting with Barack Obama, The Donald has been uncharacteristically quiet on the matter since his election. His early diplomatic faux pas \u2013 speaking by telephone to the president of Taiwan, which China considers to be a breakaway province of the mainland \u2013 may have complicated his relationship with Beijing considerably. Perhaps he will now make good on his pre-election suggestion to thrash things out with Kim Jong-un, over an all-American burger. Israel and Palestine Many presidents have attempted to deliver peace to Israel and Palestine. No one has managed it yet, but can anyone else claim to have the negotiating skills of Donald Trump? \u201cI would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d he has said. \u201cI would love that; that would be such a great achievement.\u201d Trump\u2019s secret weapon? Son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whose father has business interests in Israel. \u201cHe knows the region, knows the people, knows the players,\u201d Trump has said. But those players, when questioned by reporters from the New York Times, did not seem quite so familiar with him. \u201cI don\u2019t personally know Jared Kushner and have never met him,\u201d said one Palestinian leader. Isis Isis-schmisis. The brutal terror network is no match for Trump, who has long spoken of a plan to crush it. He ramped up his commitment in a contradictory thank-you speech last week. No more expensive intervention, he told a crowd, no more \u201cfighting in areas that we shouldn\u2019t be fighting\u201d. America first! But also Isis. \u201cOur focus must be on fighting terrorism and destroying Isis,\u201d he said. He did not explore how this would be done while reducing US intervention, but these details can be ironed out over Christmas. Kashmir Trump caused diplomatic eyebrows to raise around the world when he heaped praise on Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, during an official telephone call. According to details leaked by the Pakistani government, Trump referred to Sharif as a \u201cterrific guy\u201d. Days later, the incoming vice-president, Mike Pence, reassured Pakistan\u2019s old rival India that Trump would be \u201cfully engaged with both nations\u201d, but also suggested the president-elect\u2019s purported boardroom experience could help him make short work of their decades-long dispute over Kashmir. \u201cI think you\u2019re also going to see an energetic leadership in the world, prepared to engage and to look for ways that he can bring those extraordinary deal-making skills to bear on lessening tensions and solving problems in the world,\u201d Pence said of his boss.",
