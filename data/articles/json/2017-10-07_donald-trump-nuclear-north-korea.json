    "content": "Donald Trump on Saturday said \u201conly one thing will work\u201d in dealing with North Korea, after previous administrations had talked to Pyongyang without results. \u201cPresidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cHasn\u2019t worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, making fools of US negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!\u201c Trump did not make clear to what he was referring. Amid rising tension and exchanges of insults with the nuclear-armed regime of Kim Jong-un, Trump has previously said the US will destroy North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies. Later on Saturday, Trump spoke to reporters at the White House before he left for a fundraiser in South Carolina. Asked to clarify his cryptic \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d remark earlier this week, which was made to reporters ushered into a dinner with military leaders, he said: \u201cNothing to clarify.\u201d Trump also repeated that he and the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, had \u201ca very good relationship\u201d. Tillerson has been the target of criticism from the president about his attempts to talk to North Korea and to engage China to rein in Pyongyang. Tillerson could be tougher, Trump said. He did not elaborate on what that meant. It was reported this week that in a session with Trump\u2019s national security team and cabinet officials at the Pentagon this summer, Tillerson openly criticized the president and called him a \u201cfucking moron\u201d. At a press conference on Wednesday, Tillerson said he had never considered resigning and was committed to Trump\u2019s agenda, but failed to address whether he had referred to the president as a \u201cmoron\u201d, as NBC reported. On Saturday Trump said again that the reports of the \u201cmoron\u201d remark, which reportedly made him furious and led to staff efforts to control the controversy, were \u201cfake news\u201d. He also said his chief of staff, the retired general John F Kelly, was \u201cone of the best people I\u2019ve ever worked with\u201d, was \u201cdoing an incredible job\u201d and would \u201cbe here in my opinion for the entire remaining seven years\u201d. Kelly, the former homeland security secretary who replaced the fired chief of staff Reince Priebus in July, has been reported to be exasperated with the continuing ructions within the Trump White House.",
