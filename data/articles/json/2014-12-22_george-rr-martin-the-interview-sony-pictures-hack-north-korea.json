    "content": "The bestselling Game of Thrones author George RR Martin has offered to screen The Interview in his own independent cinema, in the wake of what he described as \u201ca stunning display of corporate cowardice\u201d from Sony and America\u2019s cinema chains. After anonymous terrorist threats last week to target screenings of the film, in which James Franco and Seth Rogen play journalists attempting to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, chains and distributors across America refused to show it. Sony then cancelled its 25 December theatrical release. Martin, whose A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series has been made into the major television hit Game of Thrones, owns the Jean Cocteau Cinema in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He slammed major theatre chains for what he called a \u201cstunning display of corporate cowardice\u201d on his blog, adding: \u201cThese gigantic corporations, most of which could buy North Korea with pocket change, are declining to show a film because Kim Jong-un objects to being mocked? \u201cThe level of corporate cowardice here astonishes me. It\u2019s a good thing these guys weren\u2019t around when Charlie Chaplin made The Great Dictator. If Kim Jong-un scares them, Adolf Hitler would have had them shitting in their smallclothes. Even Sony, which made the movie, is going along.\u201d Martin said that there were \u201cthousands of small independent theatres across the country, like my own, that would gladly screen The interview, regardless of the threats from North Korea\u201d, adding \u201cfor what it\u2019s worth, the Jean Cocteau Cinema will be glad to screen The Interview (assuming Sony does eventually release the film for theatrical exhibition) \u2026 Come to Santa Fe, Seth, we\u2019ll show your film for you.\u201d Although Martin has not seen The Interview, and has \u201cno idea how good or bad a film it is\u201d, he writes: \u201cThat\u2019s not the point, though. Whether it\u2019s the next Citizen Kane or the next Plan 9 from Outer Space, it astonishes me that a major Hollywood film could be killed before release by threats from a foreign power and anonymous hackers.\u201d The author had originally included the trailer to The Interview on his website, but when the trailers were also pulled by Sony, Martin replaced the link on his website to one of South Park, in which Jesus tells a group of ginger-haired children: \u201cDon\u2019t you see, gingers, if you don\u2019t want to be made fun of any more, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.\u201d The US government has blamed North Korea for the hacking, which has proved a major embarrassment to Sony. North Korea has denied involvement, but has voiced support for the hackers. Sony is currently considering options for an online release of the film, perhaps via YouTube or a VOD service. A Sony lawyer, David Boies, told NBC: \u201cSony has been fighting to get this picture distributed. It will be distributed. How it\u2019s going to be distributed, I don\u2019t think anybody knows quite yet. But it\u2019s going to be distributed.\u201d",
