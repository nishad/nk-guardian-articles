    "content": "Though none of the North Korean athletes competing at next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in South Korea are expected to win a medal, they will at least be assured of a thunderous reception. When North Korea recently agreed to send a large delegation to the Games, which open in Pyeongchang on 9 February, there was speculation over which athletes might take advantage of the 11th-hour wildcard entries offered by the International Olympic Committee. But far more excitement greeted Wednesday\u2019s news that the athletes will be accompanied by 230 members of the \u201carmy of beauties\u201d, North Korea\u2019s all-female cheerleading troupe who \u2013 international politics permitting \u2013 will be dispatched to portray a gentler image of one of the world\u2019s most brutal dictatorships. The women, all in their late teens or early 20s, are handpicked from elite universities and undergo strict background checks to ensure they are not related to defectors or Japanese sympathisers, according to Chinese media. \u201cThey must be over 163cm (5ft 4ins) tall and come from good families,\u201d said An Chan-il, a defector who runs the World Institute for North Korea Studies. \u201cThose who play an instrument are from a band and others are mostly students at the prestigious Kim Il-sung University,\u201d he told AFP. As the daughters of well-connected families in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, they are highly unlikely to defect, according to Jiro Ishimaru, a Japanese documentary-maker who runs a network of secret citizen journalists in the North. Cheerleading aside, their role is to challenge the common perception of North Korea as an economically backward state whose people are malnourished. \u201cAs well as being young, tall and beautiful, they train extremely hard so that they don\u2019t put a foot wrong,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThey\u2019re out to impress people, particularly South Koreans.\u201d Chosen for their loyalty to the Kim dynasty as much as their appearance, their routines are as tightly choreographed as any military parade in Pyongyang. Whether dressed in traditional hanbok or polo shirts and baseball caps, their chanting, singing and dancing often overshadow their compatriots\u2019 exertions in the sporting arena. In their first of three visits to South Korea, to attend the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, a party of 300 cheerleaders stepped off a ferry waving unification flags \u2013 a pale blue silhouette of the Korean peninsula \u2013 to the delight of many locals. A planned visit to the Asian Games in 2014 in Incheon was cancelled after Pyongyang and Seoul argued over details, including the size of the cheerleading party and their flag, and which country would foot their expenses. Its most famous alumni is Ri Sol-ju, better known these days as the wife of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who was 16 when she was part of the group that attended the 2005 Asian Athletic Championships, also in Incheon. It remains to be seen if the goodwill that greeted the troupe\u2019s previous trips to South Korea has survived a dramatic deterioration in cross-border ties after a year of missile launches, a nuclear test and threats to the US and the South. Whatever reception they receive, Simon Cockerell, general manager at Koryo Tours and a frequent visitor to North Korea, expects the cheerleaders to eclipse the country\u2019s athletes. \u201cThe world\u2019s media will focus on them, as they have done before, simply because North Korea is a source of mystery, fear, and exoticism \u2013 and because the women are pretty,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because getting substantive interviews from North Korean athletes is notoriously difficult.\u201d With less than a month before the Games open, officials from both countries face a race against time to decide how the North Korean delegation will travel across the border, where they will stay and who will pay their expenses. Some reports said they would be accommodated on a cruise ship moored in Sokcho, about an hour\u2019s drive from Pyeongchang. While the Games\u2019 organisers anticipate a late surge in ticket sales, sports fans from other countries expecting to swap stories and mementoes with the North Korean cheerleaders will be disappointed. None of the women will want to risk the fate that awaited 21 of their predecessors who were reportedly sent to a labour camp for talking about what they had seen during their 2005 visit to South Korea. Ishimaru said the group would be practically impregnable for as long as they were in \u201cenemy territory\u201d. \u201cThey won\u2019t be given the freedom to do things we take for granted, like go out for a stroll,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will leave their accommodation together and return together at the end of each day. There certainly won\u2019t be any mingling.\u201d",
