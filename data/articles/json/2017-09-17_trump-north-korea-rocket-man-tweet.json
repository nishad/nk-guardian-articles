    "content": "Advisers to Donald Trump have warned North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programmes, saying that the regime faced destruction if it continued its reckless behaviour and forced the US to defend itself or its allies. The warning came on Sunday after Trump tweeted about a phone call to South Korean president Moon Jae-in, and appeared to mock Kim Jong-un. \u201cI spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night,\u201d the US president wrote. \u201cAsked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!\u201d The latest bellicose language from Washington came just days after North Korea fired another ballistic missile, which overflew Japan, and Kim boasted that such efforts would continue as his country neared its goal of \u201cequilibrium\u201d in military force with the US. Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the United Nations, said North Korea was starting to \u201cfeel the pinch\u201d of being \u201ceconomically strangled\u201d as recent sanctions have caused the country to be \u201ccut off from the world\u201d. But, she said, diplomatic and other non-military options were running out. \u201cIf North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed,\u201d the former South Carolina governor told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cWe all know that and none of us want that. None of us want war. But \u2026 something is going to have to be done.\u201d North Korea will be high on the agenda at the UN general assembly in New York this week, after the UN security council voted unanimously for further sanctions. Asked about Trump\u2019s description of such measures as merely \u201csmall steps\u201d towards a solution of the North Korea problem, Haley said: \u201cEverybody in the international community sees what a big deal it is.\u201d CNN host Dana Bash asked if Trump\u2019s now infamous pledge to respond to any action against the US mainland or its territories with \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d was an empty threat. She said it was not and that responsibility for any stepping up of action against North Korea now lay with the Pentagon and defense secretary James Mattis. \u201cWe are trying to use every diplomatic possibility \u2026 [but] we have pretty much exhausted all the things we can do at the security council at this point,\u201d Haley said. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy kicking this over to General Mattis now, because he has plenty of military options. We wanted to go through all the diplomatic options to get their attention first and if that doesn\u2019t work, General Mattis will take care of it.\u201d National security adviser HR McMaster told ABC\u2019s This Week Kim Jong-un would \u201chave to give up his nuclear weapons because the president has said he\u2019s not going to tolerate this regime threatening the United States and our citizens with a nuclear weapon\u201d. Asked if that meant Trump would launch a military strike in the event that North Korea did not comply, as it has shown no sign of doing, McMaster said: \u201cHe\u2019s been very clear about that, that all options are on the table.\u201d The only concession was given by secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that the US still \u201cseeks a peaceful solution\u201d to the North Korean crisis. Pressure on the regime was \u201cdesigned to bring North Korea to the table for productive and constructive dialogue\u201d, he said. But Tillerson also warned that \u201cwe do not have much time left\u201d and said that if efforts to talk were to fail: \u201cOur military option is the only one left.\u201d \u201cWe have tried a couple of times to signal to them that we are ready if they are ready [to talk], but they only thing they do is fire more missiles,\u201d Tillerson said. Trump is making his first appearance at the UN general assembly, giving a speech on Tuesday morning. He has called the world body weak, incompetent, bad for democracy and no friend of the US. Haley said Trump would arrive on a \u201cnew day\u201d at a UN more committed to action and reform under a new secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.",
