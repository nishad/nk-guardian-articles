    "content": "Global leaders called for calm and a return to negotiations after Donald Trump\u2019s warning that the US is willing to be impose unprecedented fire and fury on North Korea unless it stops threatening the United States with a nuclear attack. China urged Trump and Kim Jong-un to avoid \u201cany words or actions\u201d that might cause further tensions. Pyongyang had responded to Trump\u2019s warning, saying it was considering a missile strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam. In a brief statement, China\u2019s foreign ministry said \u201ceven greater efforts\u201d were now needed to resolve the issue through talks. \u201cChina calls on all parties to avoid any words or actions that might escalate the situation and make even greater efforts to resolve the issue via talks\u201d Amongst America\u2019s traditional allies there was concern that Trumps\u2019 unexpected rhetoric might tear apart the careful consensus forged at the UN in recent weeks over ramping up economic sanctions. No warning had been given to Western allies that Trump intended to escalate US threats. The Australian leader Malcolm Turnbull warned a US military strike would have \u201ccatastrophic consequences for the world\u201d, and the New Zealand prime minister, Bill English, said the comments were \u201cnot helpful in an environment that is very tense\u201d. English said Trump\u2019s comments were more likely to escalate the situation than settle it. A French government spokesman said President Trump\u2019s determination to prevent an attack had been shared by all previous US presidents, but called on all sides to be responsible and seek to de-escalate the situation. In Berlin, a spokesman for the government of Angela Merkel said: \u201cThe goal of the German government is to avoid a further military escalation and to settle the conflict in the North Pacific peacefully.\u201d Meanwhile German government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said \u201cChina and Russia have a special responsibility to do everything they can to dissuade North Korea from a path of escalation.\u201d The German foreign ministry spokesman Martin Sch\u00e4fer added that Berlin was convinced a \u201cmilitary option\u201d could not be \u201cthe answer in the quest for a nuclear weapon-free\u201d region. Insisting North Korea was the provocateur in the dispute, he urged the international community to \u201cthoroughly implement\u201d the latest round of sanctions against North Korea just approved by the United Nations security council. He pointedly backed the call by the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, to resume talks with Pyongyang if it halts ballistic missile tests. \u201cWe must all continue our diplomatic efforts \u2013 it is the only way to ensure that the threat of the illegal North Korean nuclear weapons programme can be contained,\u201d he said. Spokesman for the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was \u201cdeeply troubled by the increase in confrontational rhetoric\u201d. Britain\u2019s UN ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, said the United Kingdom \u201cstands shoulder to shoulder with the United States\u201d in tackling the nuclear threat from North Korea and making sure it can\u2019t pursue its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. He stressed that North Korea \u201cholds the key to sanctions being removed.\u201d Asked whether Trump\u2019s escalating rhetoric was hurting prospects for reviving negotiations, Rycroft said \u201cwhat\u2019s hurting the six-party talks is the inability so far of the North Korean regime to do what it has to do which is to halt its nuclear program and to halt its intercontinental ballistic missile program.\u201d Russia, more predictably, urged Trump to refrain from anything that will provoke North Korea into dangerous reaction, and said installing an anti-nuclear shield in South Korea will only unsettle the military balance. The international calls for restraint follow sharp criticism in the US from senators and congressmen over what was described as the reckless comments by Trump. The Republican senator for Arizona John McCain said: \u201cI take exception to the President\u2019s remarks because you\u2019ve got to be able to do what you say you are going to do.\u201d In the UK, Sir Hugo Swire, the former foreign office minister responsible for Asia in the government of David Cameron, urged China and the US to make one last effort to convene the six-party talks with North Korea. But he warned that if the US went ahead with a \u201csurgical strike\u201d against North Korea it would be equivalent to lighting a match to a tinderbox across the region, and was likely to lead to a wider conflict involving China, Japan and Korea. Swire also called on the UK to intervene by calling for six-party talks. He said: \u201cWe should use our convening power as a permanent member of the UN security council to make one last try with six-party talks\u201d. But he did not join others in criticising Trump\u2019s use of inflammatory language. \u201cWell I see John McCain and others saying you should not talk of military action unless you are prepared to use that power. Well, who says President Trump is not prepared to use it? If you are President Trump sitting in the White House, and North Korea is threatening the US and 25,000 US troops in Guam, you have to respond to those threats. \u201cBut we should try for six-party talks one last time and if they fail, or North Korea refuses to attend or sets impossible conditions, there will be a morality on our side.\u201d",
