    "content": "The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has made a second surprise visit to China to meet its president, Xi Jinping, amid a flurry of diplomacy as Kim prepares for a summit with Donald Trump. Kim flew to the Chinese port city of Dalian and held talks \u201cin a cordial and friendly atmosphere\u201d with Xi over two days before returning to Pyongyang on Tuesday, China\u2019s state news agency Xinhua said in announcing the trip. It is the second meeting between the two leaders in about 40 days, and was kept secret until Kim had left China. Shortly after the summit was reported, Trump said on Twitter he would speak to Xi by phone about North Korea, where he said \u201crelationships and trust are building\u201d. Kim and Xi discussed relations between their two countries as well as \u201cmajor issues of common concern\u201d, and Kim restated Pyongyang\u2019s desire to relinquish its nuclear arsenal. \u201cIt has been the DPRK\u2019s consistent and clear stand to achieve denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,\u201d Kim said, using the acronym for North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, according to paraphrased remarks reported by Xinhua. \u201cAs long as relevant parties abolish their hostile policies and remove security threats against the DPRK, there is no need for the DPRK to be a nuclear state and denuclearisation can be realised.\u201d It was not immediately clear what security threats Kim was referring to, but experts have said North Korea may push for the removal of some or all of the 28,000 US soldiers currently stationed in South Korea. The meeting comes as Kim prepares to meet Trump, who has said the date and location of the summit is fixed but has yet to make details public. \u201cI hope to build mutual trust with the US through dialogue,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying. He said he hoped to take \u201cphased and synchronous measures\u201d in order to \u201ceventually achieve\u201d a formal peace treaty with Seoul \u2013 the two neighbours are still technically in a state of war \u2013 and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. The statement seemed to be at odds with demands from the US, which has called on North Korea to immediately disarm. Although Kim\u2019s meeting was reported in North Korean media, his remarks on denuclearisation were noticeably absent. Kim travelled to Dalian by plane, in a public and telling break with his father\u2019s traditional means of travel \u2013 he insisted on only using an armoured train due to a fear of flying. China has been angling to retain its influence over its ally amid the recent rapprochement between North and South Korea, and Kim\u2019s desire to directly engage with the US. Kim and Xi have had a frosty relationship since Kim came to power in 2011, only meeting for the first time in late March. That was Kim\u2019s first official trip outside North Korea when he travelled to Beijing in a bullet-proof train. \u201cChina is willing to continue to work with all relevant parties and play an active role in comprehensively advancing the process of peaceful resolution of the peninsula issue through dialogue, and realising long-term peace and stability in the region,\u201d Xi said. The meeting between the two men comes as the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, is set to travel to Tokyo for meetings with the Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in. Moon hosted Kim during a historic one-day summit in April, marking the first time a leader from North Korea had set foot in the South since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. The two leaders agreed to work towards the goal of \u201ccomplete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d in a joint statement that capped the cordial meeting.",
