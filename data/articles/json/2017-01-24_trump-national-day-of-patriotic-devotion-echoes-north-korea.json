    "content": "Donald Trump has echoed North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, after declaring that the day of his inauguration should be a \u201cnational day of patriotic devotion\u201d \u2013 a rallying cry that would not be out of place in the secretive state\u2019s propaganda. Trump\u2019s proclamation, which was made official on Monday, has been uttered by Kim in speeches to his 1.2 million-strong military and members of the ruling Korean Workers\u2019 party in recent years. In an address to a military parade in Pyongyang on 10 October 2015 \u2013 the party\u2019s 70th anniversary \u2013 Kim thanked the \u201cheroic men and women\u201d of the army and security services who, \u201cin hearty response to the party\u2019s appeal, have worked with patriotic devotion and created one heroic miracle after another\u201d in their quest to build a \u201cthriving socialist nation\u201d. The phrase also crops up in North Korean propaganda. On 19 December last year, the fifth anniversary of the death of Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, the Rodong Sinmun, the ruling party\u2019s official newspaper, said of the late leader: \u201cThe noble image and patriotic devotion of the peerless patriot, who reliably defended socialism centred on the popular masses and turned [North Korea] into an invincible politico-ideological power and a world military power.\u201d In an article just after Kim\u2019s death, the official KCNA news agency cited meteorologists as saying \u201cthe spring of prosperity under socialism will surely come \u2026 thanks to the patriotic devotion of Kim Jong-il, who blocked the howling wind of history till the last moments of his life\u201d. And last January, the Rodong Sinmun cited a speech in which Kim Jong-un had congratulated a socialist youth league formed in the name of his grandfather and North Korea\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung, on its 70th anniversary. Kim, according to the paper, said the league had enjoyed \u201ca history of brilliant victories of the great leaders\u2019 original idea of prioritising the youth and their wise leadership and a history of ardent loyalty and patriotic devotion, with which the young people of Korea have supported the party and the leader, the country and the people\u201d. Trump\u2019s use of the term, and its provenance, was noted on Twitter. In his inaugural speech, Trump declared that he would put \u201cAmerica first\u201d and argued that patriotic zeal could heal the nation\u2019s divisions. On Monday, paperwork was filed with the federal government declaring that the day of his inauguration, 20 January 2017, would be officially known as the \u201cNational Day of Patriotic Devotion\u201d. Trump\u2019s executive order said the proclamation would \u201cstrengthen our bonds to each other and to our country \u2013 and to renew the duties of government to the people\u201d. Jiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, said that by invoking patriotic devotion, Trump appeared to be channeling three generations of North Korea\u2019s Kim dynasty. \u201cOrdinary North Koreans hear those words every day,\u201d Ishimaru told the Guardian. \u201cThey don\u2019t just appear in the media and speeches, but on posters and in other propaganda. They hear the word patriotism at local residents\u2019 meetings, where, for example, they\u2019re told to produce more rice out of love for their country, or to collect more scrap metal for weapons and bullets.\u201d It is not unusual for incoming US presidents to draw on their political and philosophical beliefs when, as is customary, they give a new name to inauguration day. Barack Obama called his first inauguration, in 2009, a National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation; eight years earlier, George W Bush began his first term by declaring the date a National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving. Ishimaru said most ordinary North Koreans were barely aware that the US had a new president. The Rodong Sinmun reported the inauguration in a brief article, without comment, at the bottom of the newspaper\u2019s back page on Sunday, two days after it took place. \u201cI talk to North Koreans every day, and Trump\u2019s inauguration has barely registered with them,\u201d he said. \u201cLife is extremely tough, so they are too busy concentrating on their own problems to think about US politics.\u201d",
