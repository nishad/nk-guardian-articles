    "content": "The US will embark on an aggressive effort to tighten North Korea\u2019s isolation on Monday with a call for an oil embargo and a partial naval blockade. A draft United Nations resolution seen by the Observer would also block textile exports and the hiring of North Korean labour by foreign countries. The American delegation has called for the UN security council to debate the draft, in an attempt to force decisive action following last Sunday\u2019s massive nuclear test of a bomb, Pyongyang\u2019s sixth. The most striking language in the resolution authorises naval vessels of any UN member state to inspect North Korean ships suspected of carrying banned cargo and to use \u201call necessary measures to carry out such inspections\u201d. The implications of such a resolution would be far-reaching. Any attempt to board or divert a North Korean vessel could trigger an exchange of fire. As well as banning any exports of \u201ccrude oil, condensates, refined petroleum products, and natural gas liquids\u201d to North Korea, the draft resolution calls for a prohibition on the import of textiles and an end to the hiring of North Korean nationals, on the grounds that the regime uses the foreign currency earned \u201cto support its prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile programmes\u201d. Both Russia and China employ cheap North Korean labour. In Russia they work in logging camps and construction sites, helping build a new football stadium in St Petersburg that will be used in the World Cup next year. The US draft measure would also freeze the assets of Kim Jong-un and the top leadership in Pyongyang. Such a dramatic tightening of the economic vice is likely to meet resistance from China, which is anxious to avoid driving its embattled neighbour to the point of complete collapse; and Russia, which is promoting itself as a broker in the Korean standoff and has suggested that a new set of sanctions is \u201cpremature\u201d. \u201cUp to now, the Chinese and the Russians have tried to keep on giving the US just enough to keep Trump playing the UN game,\u201d said Richard Gowan, an expert on the UN at the European Council for Foreign Relations. \u201cThe question is what happens with an extraordinarily hardline resolution and US pressure to do something quickly.\u201d Gowan believes that \u201cthe Chinese are willing to consider some measures\u201d, adding that the Russians are unlikely to veto a resolution on their own. However, any compromise resolution is likely to fall a long way short of the US draft measures, in terms of its impact on North Korea. \u201cAll sides want to keep this in the council. And, for all the talk, the US doesn\u2019t actually want a war here,\u201d Gowan said. \u201cAt some point, they are going to have to compromise or walk away from the UN.\u201d The Trump administration claims to have a \u201cplan B\u201d if the UN resolution fails. The president has threatened to cut off trade with any country that continues to do business with North Korea. And on Wednesday, the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said documentation had been prepared to make that threat real if UN diplomacy failed. \u201cI have an executive order prepared that\u2019s ready to go to the president that would authorise me to stop doing trade, put sanctions on anybody that does trade with North Korea, and the president will consider that at the appropriate time once he gives the UN time to act,\u201d Mnuchin told reporters. Blanket sanctions are unlikely. More than 80% of North Korea\u2019s trade is with China, and any major trade breach with Beijing would risk triggering a global recession. However, an ever-lengthening list of Chinese firms targeted with specific sanctions for their dealings with Pyongyang is a likely outcome. Trump himself continues to brandish the threat of a preventative US strike as a last resort. This week, in response to a question about North Korea, he began talking about the \u201cnew and beautiful equipment\u201d that was supposedly being delivered to the US military each day \u2013 \u201cthe best anywhere in the world, by far\u201d. He said he \u201cwould prefer not going the route of the military\u201d, but he added: \u201cIt\u2019s something certainly that could happen.\u201d Behind closed doors, the administration\u2019s military and foreign policy officials have been sending a different message. The secretary of defence, James Mattis, and the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, are reported to have told senators on Wednesday that all the military options against North Korea were \u201cterrible\u201d. There could never be certainty that a preventative strike, however punishing, would hit all the regime\u2019s missiles and nuclear warheads, while its conventional artillery alone could wreak devastating damage on Seoul. The majority view among American foreign policy analysts is that Washington will have to settle for deterrence and containment as the best of several bad options in dealing with Pyongyang. Kim may be aggressive and provocative, they argue, but he is not suicidal, so he would never start a major war. \u201cHis motivation is clear,\u201d said Katy Oh, a senior Asia specialist at the Institute for Defence Analyses. \u201cTo sustain the Kim family in power forever and sustaining North Korea as it is.\u201d Mark Fitzpatrick, the executive director of the Americas office of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said \u201cKim wants protection against going the way of Gaddafi.\u201d Seeing the Libyan leader overthrown and killed after he had surrendered his nuclear programme in a deal with the west was a formative experience for the young North Korean dictator, Fitzpatrick said. \u201cThat is the difference between him and his grandfather and father,\u201d he added. \u201cThey wanted to make a deal, but that was before Gaddafi.\u201d He questions the theory that, once Kim has the means to deter the US, he will pursue Pyongyang\u2019s original war aims in the Korean conflict \u2013 to unite the peninsula under communist rule by force of arms. \u201cIt is pure conjecture that he wants to reunify the peninsula by force. I don\u2019t see any evidence for it,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how he can do it in the face of South Korean military might without using nuclear weapons, and if he did use them he would be occupying huge areas of radioactive territory.\u201d This view is not shared across the Trump administration, however. The president\u2019s national security adviser, Army lieutenant-general HR McMaster, has argued that North Korea, unlike Russia and China, may not be deterrable and therefore a preventative strike must remain on the table. An administration official, speaking to the New Yorker, compared Kim to Saddam Hussein. \u201cSaddam Hussein was not suicidal, but he committed suicide,\u201d the official said. Surrounded by yes-men and cut off from accurate intelligence, the Iraqi leader thought he could call Washington\u2019s bluff in 2003. The implication is that Kim might similarly miscalculate. But the same is also true for Trump. And the closer both men edge towards the brink, the smaller the margin for error.",
