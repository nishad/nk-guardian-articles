    "content": "North Korea has conducted a test of a newly developed high-thrust engine at its Tongchang-ri rocket launch station, with Kim Jong-un claiming the successful test represented \u201ca new birth\u201d of the nation\u2019s rocket industry. The engine will help the country achieve world-class satellite launch capability, the official news agency KCNA said, indicating the test involved a new type of rocket engine for long-range missiles. After personally overseeing the test Kim noted: \u201cThe development and completion of a new-type high-thrust engine would help consolidate the scientific and technological foundation to match the world-level satellite delivery capability in the field of outer space development\u201d, according to KCNA. Rocket engines are easily re-purposed for use in missiles. Outside observers say the nuclear-armed Pyongyang\u2019s space programme is a fig leaf for weapons tests. The United States and China have pledged to work together to get the North to take \u201ca different course\u201d and move away from its weapons programmes after US secretary of state Rex Tillerson met his Chinese counterpart on Saturday. North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches and is believed by experts and government officials to be working to develop nuclear-warhead missiles that can reach the US. Kim Jong-un has said the country is close to a test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. \u201cHe [Kim] noted that the success made in the current test marked a great event of historic significance as it declared a new birth of the Juche-based rocket industry,\u201d KCNA said. Juche refers to North Korea\u2019s homegrown ideology. \u201cHe emphasised that the whole world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won today carries,\u201d KCNA said.
