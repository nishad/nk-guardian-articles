    "content": "The US nuclear negotiator, Christopher Hill, is extending his visit to North Korea to try to salvage a troubled disarmament-for-aid deal. Hill had been due to leave Pyongyang today but US and South Korean officials announced that he would stay at least another day in an attempt to reach a compromise deal and persuade Pyongyang not to restart its nuclear plant. His visit coincided with the first military talks between North and South Korea in eight months. The talks broke up early with little progress made. Reports said South Korea had complained about insults to its president in the north's official media, while North Korea complained about leaflets spread by human rights activists from the south. Meanwhile Hill is aiming to persuade North Korea to accept a verification system to account for its nuclear arsenal while the north wants the US to first remove it from a list of state sponsors of terrorism. The state department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said yesterday that Hill would not offer to change the \"substance\" of any verification mechanism. Analysts have said North Korea might be trying to pressure the outgoing Bush administration as it seeks diplomatic successes to bolster its legacy. The north might also think it could reach a better deal under a new president. In an act of defiance, the north has reportedly started to restore the nuclear site where it conducted its first ever test in October 2006. South Korea's Yonhap news agency cited an unidentified government official as saying smoke has been seen rising from the Punggyeri site in the country's north-east. North and South Korea have been at war since the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce rather than a peace pact.",
