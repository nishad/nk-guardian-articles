    "content": "A shocked international community has condemned North Korea after it launched four ballistic missiles on Monday morning, three of which fell into Japanese waters. Calling on Pyongyang to \u201cstop its provocative actions\u201d, the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said the launches were in violation of multiple UN security council resolutions and threatened international peace and security. The US and Japan requested an emergency meeting of the UN security council to discuss the incident, which the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, described as \u201can extremely dangerous action\u201d. South Korea\u2019s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, condemned the launches as a direct challenge to the international community and said Seoul would swiftly deploy a US anti-missile defence system despite angry objections from China. Meanwhile, North Korea warned that military exercises by the US and South Korea were driving the region towards nuclear disaster. In a letter to the security council on Monday, North Korea\u2019s ambassador Ja Song Nam claimed the joint exercises that began on 1 March were \u201cthe most undisguised nuclear war manoeuvres\u201d. He said: \u201cConsequently, the situation on the Korean peninsula is again inching to the brink of a nuclear war.\u201d North Korea\u2019s four missiles flew about 620 miles, with three of them landing in waters that Japan claims as its exclusive economic zone. A fourth splashed down just outside the EEZ. South Korea said it was too early to say what the relatively low altitude indicated about the types of missiles, but experts said the launch did not look like an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM), but the launch of a previously tested missile. A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Captain Jeff Davis, confirmed the US had seen no ICBM launch attempt but otherwise gave no clear response to the missile launches. He did suggest more missiles may have been fired, telling reporters: \u201cThere were four that landed. There may be a higher number of launches that we\u2019re not commenting on. But four landed and splashed in the Sea of Japan.\u201d The EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, said the launches showed \u201cutter disregard\u201d for several UN resolutions, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was \u201cseriously worried\u201d. \u201cThese are the sort of actions that lead to a rise in tension in the region and of course in this situation, traditionally, Moscow calls for restraint from all sides,\u201d Peskov said. Johnson said: \u201cWe urge North Korea to stop its provocative actions, which threaten international peace and security. North Korea should instead re-engage with the international community and take credible, concrete steps to prioritise the wellbeing of its own people instead of the illegal pursuit of its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\u201d The French foreign office said: \u201cWe call on North Korea to immediately comply with its international obligations and to ensure the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear and ballistic programmes.\u201d The test launches appeared to be a reaction to huge US-South Korean military drills last week which are viewed as an invasion rehearsal by Kim Jong-un. The US has about 28,500 troops and equipment stationed in South Korea and plans to roll out the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) anti-missile defence system by the end of the year. Japan also plans to reinforce its ballistic missile defences and is considering buying either Thaad or building a ground-based version of the Aegis system that is currently deployed on ships in the Sea of Japan. The launches come as Kim\u2019s regime faces international isolation over the killing of Kim Jong-nam, the leader\u2019s half-brother, in Kuala Lumpur airport last month. On Sunday, Malaysia expelled the North Korean ambassador over the death, a move which prompted Pyongyang to announce a tit-for-tat expulsion of Malaysia\u2019s ambassador to North Korea. State media said the Malaysian envoy would leave within 48 hours.",
