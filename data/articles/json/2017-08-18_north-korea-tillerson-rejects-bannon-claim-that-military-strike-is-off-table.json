    "content": "The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has insisted that Washington is still considering using force against North Korea, in a public challenge to claims by the White House\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, that \u201cthere is no military solution\u201d to the nuclear crisis. Following talks with Japan\u2019s foreign and defence ministers in Washington on Thursday, Tillerson said the US was seeking a peaceful solution to the standoff with Pyongyang but reserved the right to use military force if political and economic pressure failed to curb the regime\u2019s nuclear ambitions. The US was \u201cprepared militarily\u201d to respond, he said. In an interview with The American Prospect published on Wednesday, Bannon, who was fired from the administration on Friday, said of North Korea\u2019s nuclear threats: \u201cThere is no military solution, forget it. \u201cUntil somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don\u2019t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, there\u2019s no military solution here, they got us.\u201d Tillerson declined to respond directly to Bannon\u2019s remarks but said he and the defence secretary, James Mattis, had Trump\u2019s full support in keeping the military option open. \u201cI think we have been quite clear as to what the policy and the posture towards North Korea is,\u201d Tillerson told reporters. \u201cOur approach has been endorsed by the president.\u201d He repeated his warning that North Korea faced a \u201cbleak future\u201d if it did not agree to negotiate the dismantling of its nuclear weapons programme, and that any diplomatic effort \u201chas to be backed by a strong military consequence if North Korea chooses wrongly\u201d. \u201cThat is the message the president has wanted to send to the leadership of North Korea \u2013 to remind the regime of what the consequences for them would be if they chose to carry out those threats.\u201d Mattis warned of \u201cstrong military consequences\u201d if the North initiated hostilities. Military analysts warn that a US pre-emptive strike against the North would be met with immediate retaliation against South Korea. A North Korean artillery barrage targeting civilians in Seoul could cause 30,000 casualties \u201cin a short amount of time\u201d, according to a 2012 study by the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability. Any further escalation could result in many more casualties north and south of the heavily armed border dividing the two countries, and possibly spread to neighbouring Japan, which hosts US military bases and almost 50,000 troops. While Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, have toned down their rhetoric in recent days, the prospects for an early diplomatic breakthrough appear dim, as the US and South Korea prepare for annual military exercises that North Korea regards as a rehearsal for an invasion. The North\u2019s deputy ambassador to the UN, Kim In-ryong, warned that the regime would not enter negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme as long as the US maintained its \u201chostile policy and nuclear threat\u201d. In a telephone conversation this week with the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Kim repeated a key North Korean demand that the US end its \u201carrogant provocations\u201d and \u201cextremely dangerous actions around the Korean peninsula\u201d \u2013 thought to be a reference to the defence drills and frequent practice sorties over South Korea by US B-1B heavy bombers based in Guam. Kim said North Korea reserved the right to carry out its threat to fire four ballistic missiles into waters off the coast of the US Pacific territory of Guam, home to US air force and naval bases and 160,000 people. The top US military officer said the Ulchi-Freedom Guardian drills, involving about 75,000 American and South Korean troops, would begin as planned on Monday. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Beijing, Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said the exercises were \u201cnot currently on the table as part of the negotiation at any level\u201d. Dunford added: \u201cMy advice to our leadership is that we not dial back our exercises. The exercises are very important to maintaining the ability of the alliance to defend itself. \u201cAs long as the threat in North Korea exists, we need to maintain a high state of readiness to respond to that threat.\u201d The US has dismissed a \u201cdual suspension\u201d proposal by China that would involve cancelling the drills in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programmes.",
