    "content": "Donald Trump has launched his latest Twitter assault on China, accusing its Communist party leaders of doing \u201cNOTHING\u201d to help the United States thwart North Korea\u2019s quest for nuclear weapons. \u201cI am very disappointed in China,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cOur foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet \u2026 they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. \u201cWe will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!\u201d he added. The comments came after Kim Jong-un celebrated his country\u2019s second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test late on Friday, in what North Korean state media described as a warning to the \u201cbeast-like US imperialists\u201d. On Saturday, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, accused Russia and China of being North Korea\u2019s \u201cprincipal economic enablers\u201d and claimed they bore \u201cunique and special responsibility\u201d for its \u201cbelligerent\u201d pursuit of nuclear weapons. Conservative news outlets in the US appeared to relish Trump\u2019s decision to assail Beijing for its alleged role in North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear programs. \u201cTrump rips China on Twitter,\u201d ran a Fox News headline. Beijing is likely to be less amused. \u201cTo some extent, I think Trump\u2019s tweets are a bluff. But the Chinese government has to take this seriously,\u201d said Li Yonghui, an international relations expert from Beijing\u2019s Foreign Studies University. Li said he expected Trump\u2019s planned state visit to China later this year to still go ahead, despite growing tensions between Washington and Beijing. But China now needed to brace itself for \u201cunfavourable measures in the near future\u201d from the White House, he warned. Dali Yang, an expert in Chinese politics from the University of Chicago, said that in recent weeks China had enjoyed a temporary respite from Trump\u2019s attentions because of his battle to repeal Obamacare. \u201cNow that breathing room is gone and of course Beijing has to manage this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the president running his foreign policy by tweeting again.\u201d Yang said Trump\u2019s latest China tweets were partly a diversionary tactic to distract public attention from the Obamacare defeat and partly a negotiating tactic designed to increase pressure on Beijing on issues such as North Korea and trade. However, he predicted Trump would struggle to extract major concessions from China\u2019s leaders who were preparing for a key twice-a-decade political congress this autumn and could not risk being seen \u201ccaving in to Washington\u2019s demands\u201d. Observers say Trump had hoped to convince Chinese president Xi Jinping to form a partnership with the US which would have seen the world\u2019s top two economies tackle North Korea together. That explained the conciliatory and at times fawning language Trump has used to refer to Xi, who he has repeatedly hailed as a \u201cterrific guy\u201d and a \u201cgreat leader\u201d with whom he enjoys \u201cgreat chemistry\u201d. However, with Saturday\u2019s tweets that approach appears to have run its course. Li said US-China relations were so vital that the \u201cthe boat of friendship\u201d between the two countries was not in imminent danger of capsizing. But Trump\u2019s tweets showed he had \u201cgradually lost his confidence and patience\u201d in Beijing. \u201cI think what he tweets shows his real state of mind,\u201d Li said. China offered no immediate reaction to Trump\u2019s Twitter challenge. But Ben Rhodes, a foreign policy adviser under Barack Obama, rejected Trump\u2019s claims about Chinese inaction on North Korea. \u201cIt is not at all true that China can easily solve this problem and this is a very dangerous and destabilizing approach,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. There were reports, later, that two US B-1 bombers fly over the Korean peninsula in response to North Korea\u2019s missile test. Additional reporting by Wang Zhen",
