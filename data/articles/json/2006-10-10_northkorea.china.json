    "content": "China came under intense pressure to impose sanctions on its historical ally North Korea today as the world weighed up measures to punish Pyongyang for yesterday's claimed nuclear weapons test. Acknowledging that the controlled explosion had damaged a relationship once described as being \u201cas close as lips and teeth\u201d, foreign ministry officials in Beijing said their country would support \u201cappropriate action\u201d by the UN security council. In the aftermath of the blast, the US and Japan are pushing for ship inspections, a ban on military goods, luxury items, a restriction on official visits and a tighter crackdown on North Korea\u2019s financial dealings overseas. Australia announced a range of measures, including curtailing visas. But the cooperation of Beijing will be crucial if punitive measures are to bite. China provides more than 70% of the food aid and economic assistance flowing into North Korea. It is also Pyongyang\u2019s main trading partner, accounting for between a third and a half of the isolated nation\u2019s business with the outside world and props up the economy with supplies of cheap fuel. In a break with Beijing\u2019s usual stance, foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao did not rule out the possibility of sanctions. \u201cThe DPRK ignored the opposition of the international community and brazenly conducted a nuclear test,\u201d he said. \u201cChina resolutely opposes this.\u201d But Mr Liu said the use of military force was unimaginable. \u201cChina is firmly opposed to war to resolve the issue on the Korean peninsula,\u201d he said. The only way to resolve this issue is to get all parties back to the negotiating table.\u201d The blast has severly damaged the 50-year friendship between the two nations, who fought side by side against the US and South Korea in the 1950-52 Korean war. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to deny that this test has had a negative impact on relations,\u201d said Mr Liu. \u201cIt is obvious that on the denuclearisation of the peninsula, China and North Korea have great differences.\u201d China is furious that Kim Jong-il has twice very publicly ignored its advice. In July, North Korea conducted a missile test just days after Chinese prime minister Wen Jiabao urged it not to do so. Yesterday\u2019s claimed nuclear test came the day after Chinese president Hu Jintao urged restraint. The process of six-nation talks - which Beijing has hosted for the past three years - now lies in tatters. Uncertainties linger about the nature of the test. The US has yet to confirm that the blast was caused by a nuclear device. Estimates of its explosive power range from Russia\u2019s guess of 15 megatons - roughly equivalent to the bomb that flattened Nagasaki - to France\u2019s claim that it may have been as little as 500 tonnes, an unusually small amount for an atomic weapon. US monitoring stations and Japanese planes are sampling the air and water around the peninsula for traces of radiation. South Korean officials estimate that it will take two weeks before the outside world will have a clear idea of what happened. But the explosion is being treated as a major challenge to regional stability. \u201cThis is really very serious. The test demonstrates that North Korea has deliberately defied China\u2019s wishes and advice,\u201d said Shi Yinhong of Renmin University. \u201cChina is left with a feeling of anguish and faces a major dilemma in its foreign policy making.\u201d Despite the flurry of displomatic activity, there were few signs of an increase in military tension. US forces in Okinawa, home to tens of thousands of Marines and hundreds of F-15s and F-16s, were not placed on high alert. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, softened fears of a regional arms race by promising that his country would maintain its non-nuclear policy. Hong Kong media reported that the People\u2019s Liberation Army has suspended leave for all troops along China\u2019s 1,400km border with North Korea. In Dandong - a major crossing point - customs officials said they would close the main road for goods trucks, though it was not clear how long this would last and whether it was connected to the nuclear test. The Chinese government insisted that situation on the border was normal. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see what the government will do next,\u201d said Zhou Yongsheng, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University. \u201cSanctions will make the North Korean regime more fragile, possibly even leading to a collapse. That\u2019s not what China wants. But if the security council passed a sanctions motion, China will have to comply even if it abstains during the vote.\u201d Even if Kim Jong-il remains in power, a deterioration of the North Korean economy is likely to force an exodus of refugees into China. Academics say Beijing is already straining to cope with refugees from the famines of the late 1990s, when 300,000 North Koreans flooded across the border. International aid workers said the humanitarian situation in the impoverished nation was bleak even before the tests. Floods, government controls and a reduction of food donations has forced the UN\u2019s to scale back its world food programme. Punitive measures can only make the situation worse. \u201cWe are drastically underfunded already,\u201d said Michael Huggins, a spokesman for WFP in Pyongyang. \u201cWith only a tenth of the money that we appealed for, we have had several pipeline breaks since January. Our goal was to feed 1.9m people, mostly women, children and other vulnerable members of society, but we are only able to reach half of them now.\u201d Residents of Pyongyang, however, said there was no apparent change in the mood of the city. Although the state-run television channel announced the \u201cjoyful news\u201d of the test yesterday evening, the main concern of people today was festivities for the anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers party. \u201cIt is business as usual,\u201d said a foreign aid worker. The North Korean government has said it would treat sanctions as an act of war. One official warned that the communist nation could fire a nuclear-tipped missile unless the US enters into dialogue with Pyongyang, the Yonhap news agency reported today. \u201cWe hope the situation will be resolved before an unfortunate incident of us firing a nuclear missile comes,\u201d the unnamed official said. \u201cThat depends on how the US will act.\u201d",
