    "content": "North Korea\u2019s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, has issued a withering riposte to Donald Trump, likening his threat to destroy the regime to the \u201csound of a dog barking\u201d, adding that he \u201cfelt sorry\u201d for the US president\u2019s advisers. In his first speech to the UN general assembly, Trump said on Tuesday the US would be forced to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if Washington was forced to defend itself or its allies against the country\u2019s missiles. Referring to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, by a nickname he gave him in a tweet last weekend, Trump said to the visible dismay of some in the hall: \u201cRocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime.\u201d Speaking to reporters outside his hotel after arriving in New York on Wednesday, Ri cited a Korean proverb when asked to respond to Trump\u2019s vow to destroy his country. \u201cThere is a saying that the marching goes on even when dogs bark,\u201d Ri said, according to South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. \u201cIf he was thinking he could scare us with the sound of a dog barking, that\u2019s really a dog dream,\u201d he added. In Korean, a dog dream is one that makes little sense. Asked what he thought of Trump\u2019s description of Kim as rocket man, Ri replied: \u201cI feel sorry for his aides.\u201d Trump\u2019s confrontational speech came after months of rising tensions on the Korean peninsula, culminating in Pyongyang\u2019s sixth, and biggest, nuclear test and the launch of two ballistic missiles over northern Japan. As the US and North Korea traded verbal barbs, Washington\u2019s allies in the region risked angering China by dismissing the prospect of dialogue with the regime. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, told the UN general assembly that previous talks had come to nothing and called for a global blockade that would deny North Korea access to \u201cgoods, funds, people and technology\u201d for its missile and nuclear programmes. Repeating his support for Washington\u2019s position that all options, including military action, remained on the table, Abe said pressure in the form of sanctions was preferable to negotiation. \u201cWe must make North Korea abandon all nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. What is needed to do is not dialogue, but pressure,\u201d said Abe, who devoted his entire speech to North Korea. Warning that time was running out for a solution to the North Korean crisis, Abe said the failure of a 1994 agreement between the North and the US to freeze Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme, and the stalling of six-party talks almost a decade ago, were proof the regime would not respond to dialogue. North Korea had \u201cno intention whatsoever of abandoning its nuclear or missile development,\u201d he said. \u201cFor North Korea, dialogue was instead the best means of deceiving us and buying time. In what hope of success are we now repeating the very same failure a third time?\u201d While China has voiced anger at North Korea\u2019s volley of missile tests in recent months, it fears the consequences of regime collapse in Pyongyang and has repeatedly called for a negotiated solution, with its foreign minister, Wang Yi, urging an end to the \u201ccurrent deepening vicious cycle\u201d. But even South Korea\u2019s liberal president, Moon Jae-in, appears to have abandoned, for now, the idea of engaging his country\u2019s neighbour after its nuclear test earlier this month. Moon\u2019s office said he welcomed Trump\u2019s \u201cfirm\u201d speech to the UN. \u201cIt clearly showed how seriously the United States government views North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme as the president spent an unusual amount of time discussing the issue,\u201d the presidential Blue House said in a statement. Trump\u2019s speech \u201creaffirmed that North Korea should be made to realise denuclearisation is the only way to the future through utmost sanctions and pressure\u201d, it added.",
