    "content": "Donald Trump and senior officials said on Sunday the US would consider any lever \u2013 diplomatic, economic or military \u2013 to forestall North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, a day after the vice-president arrived in the area and the isolated nation launched a missile test that failed. The president and his national security adviser, HR McMaster, said they first hoped that China would act on its neighbor, which depends on Beijing to prop up its trade and finances. Trump said he had backtracked on a campaign promise to immediately denounce China, in order to push the country on North Korea. \u201cWhy would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem?\u201d he wrote on Twitter from his resort in south Florida. \u201cWe will see what happens!\u201d McMaster also hailed the president\u2019s new relationship with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, whom he hosted in Florida earlier this month. \u201cThe consensus with the president, our key allies in the regions \u2013 Japan and South Korea in particular, but also the Chinese leadership \u2013 is that this problem is coming to a head,\u201d McMaster told ABC\u2019s This Week, speaking from Afghanistan. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully.\u201d Each missile and atomic bomb test \u2013 officials had feared a sixth nuclear test over the weekend \u2013 represented steady progress for dictator Kim Jong-un, McMaster said, whether or not a given test was deemed successful by his regime. The adviser refused to rule out overt or covert military action to stop what he called \u201ca grave threat to all people\u201d. \u201cThis is a situation that just can\u2019t continue,\u201d McMaster said. \u201cThe president\u2019s made very clear that he is not in the business of announcing in advance exactly what he\u2019s going to do in any particular situation.\u201d McMaster held out hope that Beijing could exert economic pressure on Pyongyang. He said Trump and Xi had cultivated a \u201cwarm relationship\u201d and that the Chinese leader was \u201ccourageous\u201d to abstain from siding with Russia in the United Nations this week. China had previously joined Russia in voting against resolutions to denounce the actions of Syria\u2019s government in its civil war. During their meeting, Xi briefly told Trump about the deep ties and complicated history between China and North Korea, Trump told the Wall Street Journal this week. \u201cAfter listening for 10 minutes I realized that not \u2013 it\u2019s not so easy,\u201d Trump said, expressing surprise at the pressures of trade and migration along the Chinese-North Korean border. \u201cA lot of goods come in. But it\u2019s not what you would think.\u201d A few days after that meeting, though, Trump said he would be willing to act alone. \u201cIf China decides to help, that would be great,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIf not, we will solve the problem without them!\u201d American defense and intelligence officials have refused to say whether the US, possibly through a covert cyber-attack, played a role in causing the North Korean missile to explode after its test launch. On Sunday, the deputy national security adviser, KT McFarland, told Fox News Sunday she could not say whether a cyber campaign begun by Barack Obama\u2019s administration had continued. \u201cYou know we can\u2019t talk about that,\u201d she said. On Saturday, the US defense secretary, Jim Mattis, delivered an unusually curt statement on the launch. \u201cThe president and his military team are aware of North Korea\u2019s most recent unsuccessful missile launch,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president has no further comment.\u201d In Seoul, Mike Pence made more familiar remarks promising support for its allies in the Pacific. Speaking at an Easter dinner on a military base, the US vice-president called the test a \u201cprovocation\u201d and promised US support for South Korea. \u201cOur commitment to this historic alliance with the courageous people of South Korea has never been stronger,\u201d Pence said. During his presidential campaign, Trump wavered on this assurance and suggested that Japan and South Korea should perhaps defend themselves. Only about 35 miles from the demilitarized zone, Seoul stands within range of North Korean artillery, a detail noted by American lawmakers on Sunday as they argued for urgent diplomacy and sanctions. Nearly 30,000 American service members are stationed in South Korea, and the US sent an aircraft carrier toward the peninsula last week. John McCain told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that China was \u201cthe key\u201d to preventing \u201cwhat could be a cataclysmic event\u201d. \u201cThey can stop this if the want to because of their control over the North Korean economy,\u201d the Republican senator said. Bernie Sanders similarly told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that partners in Asia must act in tandem, saying: \u201cThe United States must not act impulsively and we must not act unilaterally.\u201d Sanders and Ed Royce, the chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, argued for more sanctions. Royce specifically urged the president to impose sanctions on 10 Chinese banks, to choke funding for North Korea\u2019s missile program. \u201cWe are looking at shutting off every dime of money that goes in there,\u201d Royce told CNN. Chinese diplomats have grown increasingly frustrated with Kim\u2019s regime, and in February Beijing banned North Korean coal imports, a major source of income. In January, China said it would comply with new UN sanctions. Even so, trade between the nations has increased since last year: North Korea does 80-90% of its trade with China. North Korean officials did not comment on the failed missile launch. On Saturday, Kim celebrated the 105th anniversary of his grandfather\u2019s birth, a holiday called the Day of the Sun. From a raised platform, Kim watched soldiers march and wheel out a large, camouflage-painted missile that was put on display for the foreign press. McMaster said the propaganda was disturbing, even though it was not clear whether the missile was genuine or a shell for show.",
