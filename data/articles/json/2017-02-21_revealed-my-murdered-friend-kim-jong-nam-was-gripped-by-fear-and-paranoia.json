    "content": "Kim Jong-nam spent his last few years highly paranoid, hiding from the regime run by his dictator half-brother while struggling with a sense of powerlessness over the fate of his homeland, according to people who knew him. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, a close friend and confidant of the man once heir to the North Korean dynasty talked about Kim\u2019s open-minded views and personality that led to his exile \u2013 and possibly his death. In several trips to Geneva over the past two years, the last one just a few months ago, Kim visited Anthony Sahakian, an old friend from his teenage years at a prestigious international school in the Swiss city. During Kim\u2019s visit, the former classmates would meet almost daily for a coffee, a cigarillo and a walk. Known simply as \u201cLee\u201d to Sahakian, he lived with the knowledge that his younger half-brother, Kim Jong-un, might see him as a threat to the autocratic rule he assumed after their father, Kim Jong-il, died in 2011. \u201cWe actually did discuss the regime, his half-brother, about things going on there. One thing I can say, he was never interested in power,\u201d Sahakian, 44, said. \u201cHe wanted out. He never had any ambitions to rule the country. He didn\u2019t accept or appreciate what was going on there. He kept relations with the regime at arm\u2019s length.\u201d Malaysian officials say two women, believed to be employed by North Korean agents, appear to have poisoned Kim Jong-nam a week ago while he waited for a flight from Kuala Lumpur to his home in Macau. He died in the ambulance. On Tuesday, a health official told reporters that the cause of death had not yet been determined. The autopsy showed no evidence of a heart attack or sign of puncture wounds on Kim\u2019s body, the official said. Asked if there was any indication that Kim had been poisoned, the official said medical specimens had been forwarded to experts who can determine the cause of death. \u201cWe have to confirm with the lab report before we can make any conclusive remark,\u201d he said. Sahakian\u2019s recollections of their wide-ranging conversations provide the most candid insight yet into the political views Kim Jong-nam held during his brother\u2019s six-year rule, and the fears that his life could be cut short. \u201cHe was afraid. It wasn\u2019t an all-encompassing fear but he was paranoid. He was a politically important person. He was worried. Of course he was worried,\u201d said Sahakian. It is not clear why Kim Jong-nam, the first heir, was sidelined. His maternal aunt published a memoir after defecting saying Kim Jong-il was besotted with his first son, cooing over him as a baby. But Kim Jong-nam\u2019s grandfather, the \u201cGreat Leader\u201d and founder of modern North Korea, Kim Il-sung, did not approve of the extramarital relationship between Kim Jong-il and the child\u2019s mother, a local film actress. Leaving North Korea Kim Jong-nam was moved out of the country, to Russia and then Switzerland, where he learned French, Russian, German and English. This is when Sahakian first met him, aged 12 or 13. He was introduced as the son of an ambassador even though his real father was back home being groomed for the leadership. \u201cAt the time we had no idea what the difference between North and South Korea was,\u201d Sahakian said. \u201cHe was a very jolly child, very friendly, very kind, very nice, very generous. Liked life at the time \u2026 spoilt obviously, but we all were somewhat spoilt. Nothing out of the ordinary.\u201d The only bizarre recollection Sahakian has is of his North Korean friend in a luxurious Mercedes-Benz 600, \u201cdriving it himself, which was a bit surprising because we were 15 at the time\u201d. By the time he returned home, Kim Jong-nam was an adult and a product of his European upbringing. According to his aunt\u2019s memoirs, he was suffocated by the isolation in North Korea. He fell further out of favour when he was caught sneaking into Japan on a fake Dominican Republic passport in 2001. After that, he lived in exile \u2013 in Macau, a Chinese territory near Hong Kong, where he and his wife had children, and also Singapore. He kept a house in Beijing, according to another friend. Occasionally spotted in jeans and a T-shirt at airports or restaurants from Paris to Indonesia, Kim always smiled politely to reporters. Although he once made it clear to journalists that he had not \u201cdefected\u201d, it was apparent that he was in exile \u2013 whether self-imposed or forced. Possibly seeing a chance for reform as his father\u2019s health waned, Kim Jong-nam spoke in early 2011 of his political views to Yoji Gomi, a Japanese journalist, months before Kim Jong-un was appointed \u201cSupreme Leader\u201d. But when Gomi published the book in 2012, which included criticism of the hereditary transfer of power, Kim Jong-nam stayed silent \u2013 possibly fearful that his brother, now in power, would seek him out in a rage. A year later, their uncle \u2013 the North\u2019s former No 2 who was close to Kim Jong-nam \u2013 was executed for his \u201cdirty political ambition,\u201d kickstarting a series of purges from the newly installed Kim Jong-un. Following that, Kim Jong-nam kept a very low profile, juggling his naturally outgoing character with a life-preserving need to avoid the spotlight. \u201cHe was very sad about the situation in his country. And he really felt for his people. It added to the pressures on him because he couldn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Sahakian said. The generals\u2019 rule Kim Jong-nam had deeply considered his role, or lack of one, in his home country, Sahakian said. He would tell his friend about a \u201cgerontocracy\u201d \u2013 rule by old people \u2013 of army generals who were \u201cborn under Stalin\u201d and kept the nation submerged in isolationist and repressive rule. His brother, he said, had become part of the monolithic system run by the much older generals around him. \u201cI don\u2019t think he meant his brother was controlled by them but definitely when everybody has a similar mindset, you live up to the mindset,\u201d Sahakian said. Kim Jong-nam, a thoughtful man who desired reform, felt powerless. Although he still had a claim to high office as the eldest son, he knew he did not have the \u201ccharacter or the will\u201d to enter the ruthless world of North Korean politics, Sahakian said. \u201cYou have to have ice in your veins to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would have to have been a lot of blood to change the system and I don\u2019t think he was up for that.\u201d Quite simply, Kim was not a monster, Sahakian insisted. But nor was he the jet-setting, casino-addicted, womanising playboy that the media often depicts. Part of the reason Sahakian agreed to speak out was to portray his friend as a \u201cdecent human being,\u201d he said. \u201cHe might have gambled, he might have been caught drunk. He liked women but what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d King Jong-nam had told him he would not accept money from North Korea and lived off various business ventures in Europe. When he visited Geneva, he used Airbnb. But living a normal life was hard. \u201cYou have to imagine the immense psychological pressure for somebody like that,\u201d said Sahakian. \u201cWhat\u2019s your skillset as a dictator\u2019s son? What do you do? Go work for Goldman Sachs? It wasn\u2019t easy for him.\u201d His undesired status as a member of the ruling family of the world\u2019s most isolated state meant Kim also had to call governments in advance of his arrival. \u201cWhat he mentioned to me is that he had to talk to people in order to travel,\u201d said Sahakian. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let him travel freely without some sort of debrief, I would imagine.\u201d Perhaps it was this, his international lifestyle and mingling with the wider world, that Pyongyang found so threatening. Since Kim Jong-nam\u2019s death, Sahakian has considered the different scenarios that led to his friend\u2019s murder. He pauses on one theory in which a sycophantic general might have taken the initiative to kill him \u2013 a lurid surprise gift to the supreme leader. \u201cIn the paranoia there, in order to please the king, maybe somebody went too far. For this, you have to ask his brother.\u201d",
