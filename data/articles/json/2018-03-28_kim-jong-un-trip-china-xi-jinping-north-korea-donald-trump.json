    "content": "Kim Jong-un\u2019s clandestine trip to China was in many ways an atmospheric throwback to times long gone, when it was possible to keep the movements of even a national leader hidden from public view and the stately progress of a train was preferred to air travel. (Perhaps only North Korea\u2019s Kim dynasty \u2013 which has a congenital fear of flying, even though Kim Jong-un\u2019s father actually died on his train \u2013 and our own Queen remain such devotees to rail.) Whatever his mode of transport, however, and whatever efforts were made to keep it temporarily under wraps, Kim\u2019s visit to Beijing marks the next stage in the about-face that began with North Korea\u2019s surprise decision to compete in a joint team with South Korea in the recent Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and should culminate in the promised summit meeting with Donald Trump. In some ways it was a necessary staging post. As Kim\u2019s first known trip outside North Korea since he became leader, it illustrates his deepened sense of personal and political security. We may in the west have underestimated how precarious Kim\u2019s position actually was seven years ago when he inherited power. Whether or not on his direct orders, his uncle Jang Song-thaek was court-martialled and executed in 2013 on charges of treason and much else. Just over three years later, Kim\u2019s exiled half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur airport with a substance later identified as VX gas. If nothing else, Kim was clearly a leader who felt his position under threat. The Beijing trip also underlined the importance to an autocrat of clan ties, and the usefulness of family to signal trust and esteem for another \u2013 something in which Kim and the US president could well find a rapport. Kim\u2019s sister was his personal envoy to the Olympics, and he travelled to China with his wife \u2013 a former singer whose rare appearances at his side generate the same shock effect as the early outings of Mikhail Gorbachev and his beloved Raisa. Remember, too, that Ivanka Trump represented her father at the closing ceremony in Pyeongchang. The China trip was a staging post, too, in offering a dress rehearsal for the main act. While not \u2013 China emphasised \u2013 a state visit, Kim and his wife were treated to almost the same protocol. They had to look and play the part expected of the first couple of a \u201cproper\u201d state. China\u2019s Xi Jinping laid on a full dress banquet and a show, as well as the talks \u2013 many of the same trappings that Kim can expect when he meets Trump. The North Korean has to hold his own alongside the US president. That is most of the point. But it is as well to have a try-out first, when the footage can be edited before release if need be. You can\u2019t see the US or its media standing for similar terms. That the Beijing meeting produced a letter from Kim to Trump shows how much this was seen as a prelude to the future summit. But it also raised questions about the precise role of China in the sudden North Korea-US rapprochement. At the height of the rhetorical standoff \u2013 the tweet wars between Pyongyang and Washington \u2013 Trump in effect flounced away, calling on Beijing to take responsibility for what he implied was more a regional, than a global, problem. There was also known to be a North Korea-US back-channel via the UN, that may have staved off resort to weapons on either side. So while Trump may claim that the chief reason for the thaw was his uncompromising language and apparent readiness to face Kim down at his own nuclear-missile game, Beijing\u2019s part behind the scenes may have been crucial. After all, it sees a much closer and more lethal threat from a nuclear North Korea, and can \u2013 in being able to turn on and off the economic tap \u2013 hold a threat of immediately real, rather than apocalyptic, proportions. Yet Kim\u2019s Beijing awaydays will not just have been a staging post. While he clearly craves international recognition for himself and his country, and regards the Trump meeting as the ultimate validation, some progress towards normal relations with China \u2013 and from there to a belated peace treaty with the South \u2013 could ultimately be the greater prize. If it is to stop playing the global villain, arguably Pyongyang needs to feel secure and accepted in its own backyard. If that eventually happens, all Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear missile-waving will look more of a means than an end. \u2022 Mary Dejevsky is a Guardian columnist",
