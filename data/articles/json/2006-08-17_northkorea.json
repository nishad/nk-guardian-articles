The woman and her French husband, who said he found the infants after returning from holiday, have denied they are the parents of the babies. Their lawyer said the South Korean police could not prove that hair and other material from the home, used to match DNA with the babies, belonged to the woman. The couple are now in France, and police want the woman extradited to South Korea.",
