    "content": "Donald Trump has agreed to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un before May, a South Korean official said after a meeting at the White House. It would be the first time a sitting US president has met the leader of North Korea. \u2018Shocking that Trump agreed\u2019 Jenny Town, assistant director, US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins SAIS: \u201cIt was a bit of a shock. It wasn\u2019t shocking that Kim offered, it\u2019s a bit of a shock that Trump agreed to it,\u201d Town said. \u201cThose of us who have been pushing for US-North Korea talks, this isn\u2019t what we had in mind. \u201cTrump needs to realise this will come with a lot of criticism, and Trump needs to be able to shoulder that. Clear, consistent messaging is going to be important and Trump has not been shown to be adept at that.\u201d While Trump will not be diving into the minutiae of what North Korea needs to do with its nuclear programme, Town said he should push for \u201ca continued moratorium on nuclear and missile testing, a moratorium on space launch vehicles, stopping fissile material production and allowing inspectors back into the country\u201d. \u2018An incredible coup for Kim\u2019 Jeffrey Lewis, director of the east Asia nonproliferation program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies: \u201cThis is literally the end of a North Korean movie \u2013 North Korea develops nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, compelling the US president to come to Pyongyang,\u201d said Lewis, referring to a series called The Country I Saw. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible coup for Kim. The message is that Saddam and Gaddafi disarmed. They are dead,\u201d he said. \u201cKim finished the nuclear weapons program. He gets a summit with the president of the United States. \u201cWe should be talking to Pyongyang, but you don\u2019t frontload the big concession.\u201d \u2018Guarded optimism\u2019 Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control &amp; Non-Proliferation and former state department official: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of reasons to trust Kim, but we also want to avoid a disastrous conflict. We should look at this offer with guarded optimism and have realistic short-term goals,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThis offer was more than anyone was expecting and could have imagined and I will not deny that it seems a little too good to be true, but it is an offer worth pursuing in a careful and cautious manner. Maintaining a test freeze for as long as possible is in our interest. \u201cThe hard work of real nuclear negotiations takes months, if not years,\u201d she added. \u201cThe White House has to be prepared to endure a lot of long, slow-moving negotiations that may stall along the way.\u201d \u2018Smile, nod, but don\u2019t agree to anything\u2019 Mintaro Oba, former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy: \u201cMy advice to Donald Trump is this: nod, smile, and be open to any possibilities that help get us closer to denuclearisation and peace. And don\u2019t agree to anything \u2013 or rule anything out \u2013 without taking the time to consult trusted advisers, especially career diplomats. \u201cIt would be a shame if President Trump didn\u2019t come to the summit with a bold, creative proposal designed to put the ball in North Korea\u2019s court and test Pyongyang\u2019s willingness to make progress.\u201d China, which was a major force in previous rounds of negotiations, seems to be left out this time, but Oba said: \u201cChina has always been comfortable with the division of the Korean peninsula, but it wants to make sure the situation is stable and that tensions aren\u2019t rising in a way that could endanger China\u2019s security. Beijing will be happy with the latest progress.\u201d \u2018Kim may offer more\u2019 Frank Aum, senior North Korea expert at the US Institute of Peace: \u201cSince Kim Jong-un has already made some concessions without getting anything in return, such as freezing nuclear and missile tests, and conceding that US-South Korea military exercises need to continue as scheduled, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Kim Jong-un is prepared to offer many things during a summit meeting. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s price for giving up its weapons may be too high for the US to bear, such as the withdrawal of US forces from South Korea or the end of the US-South Korea Alliance,\u201d Aum said. \u201cOr North Korea may not provide enough reassurances on the monitoring and verification aspects of denuclearisation. Or NK may agree to denuclearise over a longer period than the US would find acceptable.\u201d",
