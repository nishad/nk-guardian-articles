    "content": "Towards the end of an opening ceremony that flitted between vibrancy and schmaltz, an image of two doves appeared on the floor of the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium and the opening bars of John Lennon\u2019s Imagine struck up. As four of South Korea\u2019s most famous singers tried to outdo each by singing each line even more earnestly than the next, the stage was flooded by volunteers holding candles of peace. You didn\u2019t need a degree in east Asian studies to work out what was happening. This felt like the International Olympic Committee making a full-frontal pitch for this year\u2019s Nobel peace prize. It might well work too. Earlier, as athletes and officials from South Korea and North Korea walked side by side, waving white flags and dancing and grinning into the camera, it was hard not to be swept up in the sustained waves of applause and joy. Meanwhile an even more important gesture was taking place in the stands, with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, turning round to shake hands with the North Korean president, Kim Yong-nam, and Kim Yo-jong, the sister of Kim Jong-un. It was a simple but potentially highly symbolic moment. South Korea is viewing Kim\u2019s visit \u2013 the highest ranking since the Korean war nearly 70 years ago \u2013 as a positive sign of the North Korean leader\u2019s willingness to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. We shall see. But Thomas Bach, the president of the IOC, was quick to stress that by marching together the North and South Korean athletes had sent a powerful message to the world and showed \u201cthe unique power of sport to unite people\u201d. \u201cAll the athletes around me, all the spectators here in the stadium, and all Olympic fans watching around the world \u2026 we are all touched by this wonderful gesture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all join and support you in your message of peace. United in our diversity, we are stronger than all the forces that want to divide us. \u201cTwo years ago in Rio de Janeiro, with the first ever Refugee Olympic Team, the IOC sent a powerful message of hope to the world. Now in Pyeongchang, the athletes from the teams of South and North Korea, by marching together, send a powerful message of peace to the world.\u201d Shortly afterwards, two athletes from the unified Korean ice hockey team, Park Jong-ah of the South and Jong Su-hyun of the North, climbed a block of steep stairs towards the Olympic flame clutching the torch. But it was left to Yuna Kim, the hugely popular South Korean figure skating gold medallist, to be given the honour of lighting it. That was the prelude to a thrilling finale of dancers with flames leaping out of their backs, snowboarders and skiers flying down a mountain before creating the Olympic rings, and an encore of fireworks to end the show. Earlier when crowds had arrived they were handed hot packs, hats and blankets to protect them from the cold. That was wise given that at a concert here in December several spectators had developed hypothermia. However, the temporary thaw in political relations was matched by the weather. It had been -21C in Pyeongchang earlier in the week. But the time the ceremony started it was a positively balmy -3C. The crowd were largely thrilled by a 130-minute show with two distinct faces. Much of it showed South Korea as a vibrant and upbeat nation, confident in its skin and its future. Yet there was unmistakable yearning for its prodigal twin to make peace with it too. How else to explain the start of the show, with five children \u2013 to quote the show notes \u2013 \u201ctravelling back in time to an ancient field of snow where heaven, earth and nature are in communication \u2013 and on a quest for peace\u201d. Later on, these children were caught in a storm. Yet they emerged to come face to face with a happier and peaceful future. In between all this the athletes were introduced and paraded and the internet in the stadium went down. Was it a denial of service attack from the North, joked one wag? But given the IOC\u2019s successful efforts to broker some sort of rapprochement \u2013 however temporarily \u2013 perhaps this wasn\u2019t a night to be too cynical.",
