    "content": "Donald Trump appeared to rule out contacts with the North Korean regime in the wake of its missile test over Japan on Wednesday, declaring: \u201cTalking is not the answer.\u201d Minutes later, however, the defense secretary, James Mattis, flatly contradicted the president\u2019s blanket statement, telling reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re never out of diplomatic solutions.\u201d Such sharply conflicting statements have become a norm for the Trump administration, but it is unclear how they are being read by the regime in Pyongyang and US allies in the region. Trump\u2019s declaration, delivered as usual in the form of a tweet, appeared to reflect frustration that his threats of \u201cfire and fury\u201d against North Korea earlier this month had failed to deter it from carrying out missile tests. He had recently claimed, after a lull of more than three weeks in such tests, that Kim Jong-un \u201cis starting to respect us\u201d. Kim, however, made it clear earlier on Wednesday that there would be more ballistic tests in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s launch of an intermediate range missile, the first ballistic missile North Korea has fired over Japan. He described the test as a \u201cmeaningful prelude\u201d to a well-advertised plan to send a salvo of similar missiles into the seas around the US territory of Guam. The launch was condemned by the UN security council, and on Wednesday, senior military officials from the US, South Korea and Japan gave technical briefings on North Korea\u2019s technological advances to the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Robert Wood, the US special envoy on disarmament, said: \u201cThe time for debate has long passed; those dangers are clear; and it is now time for concerted action.\u201d In his morning tweet on Wednesday, Trump claimed: \u201cThe US has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!\u201d North Korea experts pointed out that there had been no US aid to North Korea since 2008 and no substantive talks since early 2012. Some speculated that Trump\u2019s tweet could have been sparked by comments made on television overnight by the former US intelligence chief James Clapper, who said the US had \u201climited options\u201d in dealing with a North Korean regime that has demonstrated its ability to build nuclear warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles. \u201cWe may have to hold our nose and we may have to consider some concessions,\u201d Clapper told CNN. Days earlier, Trump responded angrily to Clapper openly questioning his mental fitness for office. Tuesday\u2019s test of a Hwasong-12 missile over Japan and into the Pacific 2,700km from its launching pad appeared to dash hopes that Washington and Pyongyang were edging toward talks. After more than three weeks went by following a 28 July ICBM test, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, hailed North Korean \u201crestraint\u201d and suggested: \u201cPerhaps we are seeing our pathway to some time in the near future having some dialogue.\u201d North Korea experts warned at the time that the administration was misreading Pyongyang if it thought Trump\u2019s threats had deterred the regime from conducting more tests, including the planned Guam salvo. On Wednesday, analysts argued that the Tuesday test over Japan did not necessarily represent a complete rejection of talks. \u201cThey could have been more provocative,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association. \u201cPyongyang could have aimed the missiles to splash near Guam as it was planning. \u201cThe timing could be important. The US and South Korea are putting on military exercises and Japan just put on unilateral sanctions, and Pyongyang always responds to provocations with provocations.\u201d She added: \u201cIt has shown that Trump\u2019s fiery rhetoric has not made Pyongyang back down, but North Korea has signaled that it could be open to negotiation. It has said it was not willing to negotiate over its nuclear programme while the US is engaged in a \u2018hostile policy\u2019. So North Korea is not saying never to talks.\u201d Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, said: \u201cMy sense is the North Koreans are now assessing their options about how to best to engage. I think they will want to enter talks once they feel they are entering with a position of strength.\u201d DiMaggio, who helped organize the first official discussions between the Trump administration and North Korean government representatives, in Oslo in May, added: \u201cI think we should fully expect to see another missile test and even another nuclear test in the coming weeks and months.\u201d",
