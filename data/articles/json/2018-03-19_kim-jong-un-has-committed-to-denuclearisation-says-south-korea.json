    "content": "South Korea\u2019s foreign minister has said that North Korea\u2019s leader has \u201cgiven his word\u201d that he is committed to denuclearization, a prime condition for a potential summit with President Donald Trump in May. Trump has agreed to what would be historic talks after South Korean officials relayed that Kim Jong-un was committed to ridding the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and was willing to halt nuclear and missile tests. North Korea hasn\u2019t publicly confirmed the summit plans, and a meeting place isn\u2019t known. South Korea\u2019s Kang Kyung-wha said Seoul has asked the North \u201cto indicate in clear terms the commitment to denuclearization\u201d and she says Kim\u2019s \u201cconveyed that commitment.\u201d She told the CBS programme Face the Nation that \u201che\u2019s given his word\u201d and it\u2019s \u201cthe first time that the words came directly\u201d from the North\u2019s leader. Meanwhile, a senior North Korean diplomat arrived in Finland on Sunday for talks with US and South Korean officials about the nuclear summit between Trump and Kim. Choe Kang-il, deputy director for North American affairs at Pyongyang\u2019s foreign ministry, is expected to meet retired US diplomat Kathleen Stephens, according to multiple reports. Trump earlier this month stunned many observers by agreeing to meet the North Korean leader following months of spiralling tensions on the Korean peninsula over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme. His response triggered a race to set a credible agenda for what would be historic talks between the two leaders. The meeting in Finland follows three days of talks between North Korean and Swedish officials in Stockholm that apparently fell short of clearing the way for a US-North Korea summit attended by both nation\u2019s leaders.",
