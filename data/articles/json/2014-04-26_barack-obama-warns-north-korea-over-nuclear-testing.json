    "content": "Barack Obama has warned North Korea that the United States \"will not hesitate to use our military might\" to defend allies, condemning the actions of \"a pariah state that would rather starve its people than feed their hopes and dreams\" and characterising the 38th parallel dividing the two Koreas as \"freedom's frontier\". \"North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons is a path that leads only to more isolation,\" the president said on a visit to South Korea that coincides with signs from the North of a fourth nuclear test. Obama raised the possibility of further sanctions if a test goes ahead. \"The commitment that the United States of America has made to the security of the Republic of [South] Korea only grows stronger in the face of aggression,\" Obama said in a speech to some of the 28,000 American service members stationed in South Korea. \"Our alliance does not waiver with each bout of their attention seeking. It just gains the support of the rest of the world,\" he said at Yongsan Garrison, headquarters for US forces in the country. The website 38 North, which closely monitors North Korea, said commercial satellite imagery from Wednesday showed increased movement of vehicles and materials near what are believed to be the entrances to two completed tunnels at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. The movements could be preparation for an underground atomic explosion, although predicting such a test is difficult. Obama said of North Korea's attempts to show force: \"Anybody can make threats. Anyone can move an army. Anyone can show off a missile. That doesn't make you strong. \"We we will not hesitate to use our military might to defend our allies and our way of life.\" The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Saturday that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, had urged his soldiers to be ready for \"impending conflict with the United States\" \u2013 but such warnings of war are run regularly in the state-controlled North Korean press. Obama's 10-minute speech followed a joint defence briefing with the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, that focused on efforts to counter the North's nuclear ambitions. US army General Curtis Scaparrotti, the commander of the joint US-South Korea command, told the two presidents his team \"works together every day to make sure that we defend the Republic of Korea and that we deter North Korea\". Following his remarks Obama left for Malaysia, the third stop on his four-country Asian tour. He opened his trip in Japan and the itinerary concludes with the Philippines early next week. In South Korea in particular Obama's mission was to underscore the US military's commitment to the region at a period of uncertainty between North Korea's provocations and China's growing power. Within an hour of arriving in Seoul on Friday Obama laid a wreath at a war memorial honouring Americans killed in the Korean war. He presided over a naturalisation ceremony for 20 US service members and military spouses stationed in South Korea. The US military is seeking to redirect resources to the Asia-Pacific as it draws down its commitment in Afghanistan, though there is concern that budget cuts could threaten plans to base 60% of US naval assets in the region. While in Seoul Obama paid tribute to victims from last week's ferry disaster. The vast majority of the 300 dead or missing were students from a single high school near the capital city.
