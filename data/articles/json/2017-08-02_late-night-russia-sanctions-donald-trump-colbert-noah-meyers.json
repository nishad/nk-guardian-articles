    "content": "Late-night hosts on Tuesday addressed a range of topics regarding the Trump administration, including the New York Times report that the president dictated his son\u2019s statement on his previously reported June 2016 meeting with Russian officials and the foreign threats from Russia and North Korea. Stephen Colbert began, \u201cFor Donald Trump, it has been a rough couple of ... his entire presidency. The chaos coming out of the White House is just coming at you so fast it\u2019s hard to keep track of it.\u201d \u201cBut come with me now into the past. Try to remember what we were talking about last month,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this place called Russia and during the presidential campaign, the president\u2019s son and guy-explaining-why-he-doesn\u2019t-tip Donald Trump Jr took a secret meeting with a whole bunch of Russians who all seem to have connections to Kremlin intelligence. And when this came out \u2013 kind of shady stuff \u2013 Don Jr released a statement saying he didn\u2019t know who he was meeting with and they mostly talked about adoption. Those were lies. Including, the lie that he said it. Because last night we find out that president Trump dictated his son\u2019s misleading statement.\u201d Colbert went on to detail the report, explaining that Trump advisors, when Trump Jr was initially drafting the statement, \u201cwanted it to be truthful\u201d. \u201cYes, they wanted it to be truthful,\u201d he joked. \u201cSo they can just plead, \u2018We\u2019d prefer to be innocent\u2019. But the president ignored his advisors and instead dictated a statement that was clearly a coverup to hide their eagerness to collude with the Russians. Now, this looks bad. And is bad. But according to his advisors, Trump \u2018Believes he is innocent and therefore does not think he is at any legal risk\u2019. And everyone knows, you can\u2019t be convicted if you\u2019re not guilty in your mind.\u201d Colbert continued: \u201cNow, asked about this report in today\u2019s televised press briefing, White House press secretary and elementary-school-teacher-who-cries-in-the-art-supplies-closet, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, defended the president.\u201d The host then showed footage of Sanders\u2019s response, in which she said that the president \u201cweighed in as any father would\u201d. \u201cYes, like any father would,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those father-son things, like playing catch or going fishing or preventing your son from implicating you in treason.\u201d Trevor Noah of Comedy Central addressed another aspect of the administration\u2019s relationship with the Kremlin: the Russia sanctions bill that overwhelmingly passed the House and Senate. \u201cWhile we know that the autocrat billionaire brothers from another mother badly want to improve US-Russia relations, it seems like it\u2019s not going quite that way,\u201d he began, explaining the passage of a veto-proof bill leveraging sanctions on Russia. \u201cNot only did they put sanctions on Russia, they\u2019ve effectively put sanctions on Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, it wasn\u2019t even close. Not only did the sanctions pass the Senate by 98-2, in the House the vote was 419-3. Everyone in congress went up against Russia like it was Ted Cruz.\u201d The host then detailed Russia\u2019s retaliatory efforts, including the expulsion of 755 American diplomats and the seizure of a US compound in Moscow. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the US can afford to get into another cold war, because the scary news is there may be a hot one right around the corner,\u201d Noah explained, referring to the news that North Korea has developed an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC. Noah continued: \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but this shit is starting to scare me. They have a missile that can hit New York. If it can make it here ... it can make it anywhere.\u201d \u201cI will say, though, the joke\u2019s on Kim Jung-Un, because if he tries to send a missile to New York, we\u2019ll all have time to evacuate because the missile will get stuck in traffic in the Lincoln Tunnel,\u201d he joked. Seth Meyers turned his focus to the president\u2019s relationship with religion and his attempts to shore up the evangelical base that supported him throughout the campaign. \u201cNow that he\u2019s president, Trump is realizing just how difficult the job is,\u201d he began. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much to show for: his health care bill failed, there\u2019s constant infighting and staff changes in the White House, and of course the Russia investigation continues to loom over him. And it\u2019s often in dark times like this that a man will turn to God.\u201d \u201cNow admittedly, Trump did talk about God a lot during the campaign, but what he had to say about God was a real mixed bag,\u201d Meyers explained, showing clips of Trump joking, at a 2016 campaign speech, about how the Bible is \u201cfar superior to The Art of the Deal\u201d. \u201cNot only is the Bible better than The Art of the Deal, it\u2019s also the opposite,\u201d Meyers joked. \u201cThe only thing they have in common is that Trump has never read either of them.\u201d Meyers went on: \u201cOne moment that best illustrated Trump\u2019s unfamiliarity with the Bible was when he referred to Second Corinthians during a speech at Liberty University, but called it something else.\u201d He then showed a clip of Trump\u2019s speech, where he refers to \u201cTwo Corinthians\u201d. \u201cTwo Corinthians, like it\u2019s a sequel to an action movie,\u201d Meyers quipped. \u201cAnd according to a Politico article from April, aside from Trump attending church services on inauguration day, making an appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast, and going to service on Easter, there\u2019s no public knowledge of any other church services that Trump has attended.\u201d \u201cAnd that makes sense because Trump would hate church,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cIt\u2019s an hour of people talking about someone other than him.\u201d",
