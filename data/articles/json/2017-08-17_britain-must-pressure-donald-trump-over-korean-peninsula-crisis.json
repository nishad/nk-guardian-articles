    "content": "We are very concerned at the level of tension over Korea, which has generated the biggest threat of nuclear war since the Cuban crisis of 1962. The US and South Korean militaries are due to commence a new set of exercises on 21 August which can only sharply raise tensions. The US already maintains a force of tens of thousands of troops in South Korea. It has installed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence missile system and is conducting joint military exercises in the country which include flying nuclear-capable bombers near to the North Korean border. Last year, Britain for the first time sent four RAF Typhoon aircraft to take part in exercises in the area alongside the US and South Korean military. Donald Trump and his national security adviser, General McMaster, have both stated that the \u201cnuclear option\u201d is on the table. This, they have made clear, includes the possibility of a first strike. Given the destructive potential of the nuclear arsenals on both sides, the \u201cnuclear option\u201d would lead to a war of genocidal proportions. Stepping up military engagement is the diametrically wrong response to the current crisis. What is needed is de-escalation on both sides. We call on Theresa May to rule out committing any British armed forces to the Korean peninsula. Britain should instead apply pressure on the US government to end the ratcheting up of tensions and to pursue a political solution.
