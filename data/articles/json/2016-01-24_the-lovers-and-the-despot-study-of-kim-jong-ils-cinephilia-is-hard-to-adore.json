    "content": "There\u2019s not a lot that\u2019s warm and fuzzy about the late dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-Il. One factoid that floats around is that \u201cthe guy loved movies!\u201d As the documentary The Lovers and the Despot shows, even this is tinged with darkness. Built around a lengthy interview with former film star Choi Eun-hee, directors Robert Cannan and Ross Adam tell the strange tale of how Choi, a South Korean, and her ex-husband, director Shin Sang-ok, were kidnapped by Kim\u2019s agents and pressed into servitude, with the order to make North Korea\u2019s film output great. Adding some strangeness into the mix: Choi and Shin, while certainly unhappy with being captured, proceeded to produce some of the best work of their lives, and with more freedom than they had while working in the capitalist system. Images from their films mixed with appearances at state functions and international film festivals play out over Choi\u2019s recollection. It\u2019s an amazing examination of how, in no matter how bizarre of a setting, life eventually settles into a \u201cnew normal\u201d and how people find ways to carry on. (Choi now lives in the United States.) It\u2019s one hell of a yarn, which makes The Lovers and the Despot\u2019s strangely soporific style something of a disappointment. Cannan and Adam color in the edges with footage of North Korea in the late 1970s, and on more than one occasion leaves one feeling that there\u2019s a more interesting movie on this topic lurking right around the corner. Not much is explained about Choi\u2019s years in detention before her husband is also abducted, other than she did a lot of gardening. Shin\u2019s dalliance with another film star is introduced as a juicy plot point, then dropped. While the overall story is shocking, once you are told the hook, the rest (no disrespect to the people who endured it) is something of an anticlimax. \u201cWhy do all our films have crying in them?\u201d we hear Kim complain on audiotape before hatching his plot. The Lovers and the Despot, like the Rogen and Franco comedy The Interview did with Kim Jong-un, continues the trend of presenting the Kims as \u201cgoofball totalitarians\u201d. For whatever reason, images of Kim Jong-il with his puff of hair and large glasses continue to get chuckles from audiences, even as we know how his people are oppressed. The west has yet to figure out fully if it should categorise North Korea as a threat, a pest of a joke. Despite direct access to witnesses, this isn\u2019t the film that\u2019s going to solve that puzzle.",
