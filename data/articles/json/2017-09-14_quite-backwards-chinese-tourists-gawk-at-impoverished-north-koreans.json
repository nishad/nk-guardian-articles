    "content": "\u201cThis is a must-see,\u201d tour guide Yu Quanqing tells his passengers as he whisks them towards a riverside gateway to the hidden kingdom of Kim Jong-un. Within an hour of being picked up at the heart of this picturesque Chinese border town, they are streaking down the Yalu river on Suzuki-powered speedboats and ferries, smartphones and selfie sticks at the ready as they approach the most secretive society on earth. \u201cAs soon as we\u2019re around that bend we\u2019ll be in North Korea,\u201d the tour leader of one packed vessel shouts as members of his 50-strong band prepare for their smash-and-grab-style junket into foreign lands. \u201cBoth sides of the river are North Korean territory, you see, so we\u2019re sort of abroad now,\u201d the guide boasts, hawking rented binoculars for 10 yuan (\u00a31.10) a pop. \u201cYou must have binoculars to see what North Koreans look like! There\u2019s no time to muck around!\u201d Tensions on the Korean peninsular have soared in recent months as two of the world\u2019s most loose-tongued leaders, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, traded headline-grabbing verbal barbs. Pyongyang ignited a new round of rhetorical pyrotechnics in early September, defying the international community with its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. Donald Trump responded by labelling North Korea \u201ca rogue nation\u201d while his defense secretary, James Mattis, warned any threat to the US, its territories, or its allies would trigger \u201ca massive military response\u201d: \u201cWe are not looking to the total annihilation of a country ... but as I said we have many options to do so.\u201d On Monday, as the UN security council unanimously approved new sanctions against Pyongyang, North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry threatened to inflict \u201cthe greatest pain and suffering\u201d on the US. \u201cThe world will witness how [North Korea] tames the US gangsters by taking a series of actions tougher than they have ever envisaged.\u201d But the furore has done nothing to scare off the thousands of Chinese tourists who are flocking to this increasingly Disneyfied stretch of their country\u2019s 880-mile border with North Korea each month. \u201cChinese tourists come to satisfy their curiosity,\u201d said Yu, a Dandong-based driver and guide who makes his living ferrying visitors to a small harbour northeast of town, where they pay 70 yuan (\u00a38.20) for one-hour sorties that take them to within a stone\u2019s throw of North Korean soil. \u201cThey want to see how poor North Koreans are.\u201d \u201cThe more the situation escalates, the more curious they become,\u201d Yu added. \u201cSure, people are worried, but only a tiny bit \u2026 There won\u2019t be a war. This is what most people believe.\u201d Up the road from the jetty where tourists from across China pile onto North Korea-bound sightseeing vessels each day, authorities have posted a series of warnings to travellers: \u201cCherish a good life. Abide by the border regulations,\u201d reads one. A second, beneath a coil of barbed wire, says: \u201cPlease do not converse or exchange objects with people on the other side of the border.\u201d Most come simply to gawk; at the North Korean washerwomen who can be seen - and photographed - scrubbing clothes in the Yalu\u2019s khaki-shaded waters; at the bedraggled North Korean soldiers sauntering along its banks, rifles slung over their shoulders; and at North Korea\u2019s blue, white and red flag which flutters over one riverside community, a reminder that Pyongyang, not Beijing, makes the rules in these parts. \u201cWe came to see North Koreans - we wanted to see their living conditions,\u201d said Jing Xingyi, an 18-year-old high school graduate from the provincial capital, Shenyang, as she made her first foray into the land of Kim Jong-un. Just a few days before the dictator\u2019s latest nuclear test, Jing and her boyfriend, Shi Junming, were among hundreds of Chinese tourists setting out on a safari-style cruise into North Korea. Asked if he was nervous about the cross-border expedition, which involved no immigration checks and appeared to stretch the notion of Chinese territory to its absolute limits, Shi nodded sheepishly. \u201cA little,\u201d the 18-year-old replied in English. \u201cThe North Korean soldiers might arrest me.\u201d Wei Jing, a mobile phone company worker from the northeastern city of Fuxin, seemed less fazed: she had brought her entire family for a day-trip into despotism. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s on her summer holidays and we wanted to see a bit of nature,\u201d the 37-year-old explained. Before posing for a selfie in front of a shabbily-dressed North Korean fisherman who was floating behind her on a dilapidated wooden skiff, Wei pondered the contrasts between her homeland and its impoverished ally. \u201cThe difference between China and North Korea is the political system,\u201d she mused. \u201cChina is a developing nation. North Korea is a socialist nation. Wei stopped and chuckled uneasily before attempting to offer a diplomatic conclusion: \u201cEach country has its own advantages.\u201d After their 60-minute excursion into the southwestern tip of North Korea\u2019s North Pyongan province, Jing and her boyfriend gave a more blunt appraisal of the rural poverty they had so fleetingly glimpsed. \u201cThey\u2019re quite backwards,\u201d she said, grinning awkwardly. \u201cThey\u2019re not living in ideal conditions.\u201d Yu, the tour guide, said his experiences of North Korea left him convinced China - a country ravished by famine during the late 1950s but now the world\u2019s number two economy - was on the right track. \u201cWhen we look at these North Koreans we feel a sense of superiority,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel sorry for them. I\u2019ve seen how poor their people are under that political system. Most of all they lack freedom and they eat bad food. North Koreans can\u2019t even feed themselves properly.\u201d For the tour leader on the boat, North Korea\u2019s deprivation was a source of merriment, rather than sympathy, as well as a money-making ruse. \u201cLook there, over to the right,\u201d he joked as a North Korean man on a bicycle pedalled past along the river bank. \u201cJust look at these North Korean private cars! All imported! Made in Japan!\u201d Additional reporting by Wang Zhen",
