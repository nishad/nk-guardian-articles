    "content": "Laibach, a group never afraid to do things other groups won\u2019t, have announced their \u201cLiberation Day tour\u201d consisting of two dates \u2013 in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. The band will visit the closed state for gigs on 19 and 20 August, to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Korean peninsula\u2019s liberation from Japanese rule. The concerts will be filmed for a documentary to be released in 2016. Laibach formed 35 years ago in the then-Yugoslavian industrial town of Trbovlje, and became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the west in the mid-80s for their seemingly quasi-fascist appearance, and for their habit of turning contemporary pop hits, such as Opus\u2019s Live Is Life or Queen\u2019s One Vision into terrifying martial anthems. As time has passed, though, they have come to be regarded as one of Europe\u2019s most enduring and fascinating experimental groups.",
