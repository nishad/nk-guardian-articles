    "content": "The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, appears to have rejected Donald Trump\u2019s school of diplomacy, insisting the world should keep trying to reach North Korea, despite the US president publicly claiming it is a waste of time. Trump tweeted that \u201cbeing nice to Rocket man hasn\u2019t worked in 25 years, why would it work now\u201d, adding \u201cClinton failed, Bush failed and Obama failed. I won\u2019t fail\u201d, in an apparent reference to the Kim dynasty, which began with Kim Il-sung. The US president has taken to calling Kim Jong-un, the current ruler of the rogue state, \u201crocket man\u201d and announced he had told his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, he was \u201cwasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man\u201d over Twitter. \u201cSave your energy Rex, we\u2019ll do what has to be done!\u201d he wrote overnight. However, Bishop, speaking from Perth on Monday, said she believed Tillerson was \u201cseeking to find a resolution to the current crisis on the Korean peninsula\u201d. She also praised the US for helping to convince China to \u201cplay a much more active role\u201d. \u201cI think that is in response to the president\u2019s focus on North Korea as being an issue that the region must try solve,\u201d she said. Bishop said Australia had an interest in bringing about a peaceful resolution to the crisis, which escalated when Pyongyang authorised the firing of missiles over Japan. It has also stepped up its nuclear advancements and so far has refused to heed calls to put a halt to its program, despite a tightening of economic sanctions on the rogue state. Australia has been in support of the unanimous security council resolutions, while also calling on China to use more of its influence. \u201cThree out of our four major trading partners are in north Asia, any further nuclear tests that threaten the security of the region, of course, would be against our interests, let alone those of the countries in the region,\u201d Bishop said. Trump and Kim have been locked in an escalating war of words, with Trump threatening to \u201ctotally destroy North Korea\u201d, if it did not cease its weapons program, while North Korea later accused Trump of a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d.",
