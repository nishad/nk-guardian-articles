    "content": "Donald Trump faced criticism from Republican allies on Sunday after apparently agreeing to meet Kim Jong-un without demanding that North Korea start scrapping its nuclear program. Senators from Trump\u2019s own party expressed scepticism and urged him to set tougher preconditions, amid growing concerns over the administration\u2019s chaotic approach to nuclear diplomacy. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado said Trump should not meet Kim until North Korea produces proof it has begun reversing its years-long pursuit of a nuclear weapon. \u201cWhat we have to hear more of is how we are going to get to those concrete, verifiable steps towards denuclearisation before this meeting occurs,\u201d Gardner told Face the Nation on CBS. Trump\u2019s team has given a series of muddled statements on that precondition. No mention of it was made during an abrupt announcement on Thursday that Trump was willing to hold a summit with Kim by May, in what would be the first ever meeting of the two countries\u2019 leaders. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said on Friday that Trump was \u201cnot going to have this meeting take place until we see concrete actions that match the words and the rhetoric of North Korea\u201d. She later in effect retracted that statement in briefings to reporters. Her deputy, Raj Shah, told ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday the meeting had been premised on \u201ca commitment to denuclearisation\u201d made by Kim. Yet Mike Pompeo, the director of the CIA, told CBS only that Kim had \u201cagreed to have a conversation about denuclearisation\u201d. The president has offered little clarity. After tweeting about conversations with world leaders on the issue he returned to it in a rambling speech to supporters in Pennsylvania on Saturday evening, saying of North Korean denuclearisation: \u201cThey are thinking about that \u2013 who knows what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d The uneven public statements followed an eccentric unveiling of Trump\u2019s historic acceptance of Kim\u2019s invitation. The decision was announced to journalists on the White House driveway by a South Korean official, shortly after Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, had said direct negotiations were a distant prospect. Having lambasted Barack Obama for what they deemed an overly conciliatory approach to Iran during nuclear talks, Republicans were left struggling to defend Trump\u2019s position. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody really believes that North Korea is prepared to denuclearise,\u201d Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican critic of Trump, said on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press. Asked on CNN\u2019s State of the Union if Trump was being naive, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said: \u201cLet\u2019s hope not.\u201d Urging Trump to \u201cratchet up\u201d sanctions on Kim, Johnson said the US must not \u201clet off the pressure and just watch [North Korea\u2019s] behaviour go in the wrong direction\u201d. Pompeo and Trump advisers stressed that North Korea had agreed to suspend missile tests and to allow the US and allies to continue conducting military exercises in the region. At the Pennsylvania rally, Trump urged supporters not to boo when he mentioned Kim, saying that \u201cfor now we have to be very nice\u201d to the young leader. \u201cI may leave fast or we may sit down and make the greatest deal for the world,\u201d he said of their possible meeting. Democrats, too, expressed concerns. \u201cI am very worried that he\u2019s going to go into these negotiations and be taken advantage of,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on CNN. Warren said Trump should urgently address a lack of senior diplomats who would probably be needed for successful negotiations. The US has no permanent ambassador to South Korea or assistant secretary of state for the region. That view was echoed by Ben Rhodes, a former senior aide to Obama, who was involved in the Iran deal and said the Trump administration appeared unprepared for discussions of similar gravity. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more complex than nuclear negotiations; there\u2019s no place in the world more volatile than the Korean peninsula,\u201d Rhodes told ABC. \u201cYou cannot just approach this like a reality show.\u201d",
