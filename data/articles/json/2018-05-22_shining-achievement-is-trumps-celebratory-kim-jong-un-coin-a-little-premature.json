    "content": "Name: The Donald Trump/Kim Jong-un coin. Age: Brand new! Appearance: Shiny! So good! Really, really good. The best coin. This coin should get the Nobel prize for coins. What\u2019s going on? Donald Trump has issued a commemorative coin for the talks between himself and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Did I miss a memo? Have they happened already? I thought they were on 12 June? In Singapore, that\u2019s right. But how can you commemorate something that hasn\u2019t happened yet? How do you know that what\u2019s going to happen is something you\u2019re going to want to commemorate with a coin? I see that someone\u2019s still stuck in the past, when facts were facts, meanings were fixed, time was linear and everybody had to do things in the \u201cright order\u201d and face the \u201cconsequences\u201d. I am. Well, get with the programme. That\u2019s all fake news now. As is the coin. The coin is real! You can hold it in your hand! Yes, but \u2026 Don\u2019t dwell. It\u2019s a lovely coin! See Trump stare down a grinning Supreme Leader! Gold! Shiny! Does he know there\u2019s actually no such official position in North Korea as Supreme Leader? To be honest, Trump is a tad keener on designing the merch than getting to grips with details. You don\u2019t say. So he hasn\u2019t thought about how having celebratory coins pre-emptively struck might make it harder for him to walk away from talks if they don\u2019t go the way he wants? Have we thought how he will react even without these little numismatic touches that will aggravate his humiliation? Trump is a deal maker! A terrific deal maker and a maker of terrific deals! He makes deals terrifically! Deal-wise, he terrific makes! But North Korea is already threatening not to attend the summit because the US won\u2019t accept that disarmament is off the table. Well you don\u2019t have to worry! Wait until you see Trump the deal maker in action! It\u2019s an art. Buy his book \u2013 The Art of the Deal. He is the best deal-maker. Also, have you seen how shiny this coin is?! It is very shiny. I\u2019m still not sure the US minting a portrait of a tyrant who is imprisoning an estimated 120,000 of his own people in brutal camps is such a good look. The point is, they have captured the 45th president\u2019s hair really well. Just look at that sloping non-neckline! It\u2019s beautiful. Do say: \u201cThis is the entry code to the nearest nuclear bunker.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cHeads no one wins, tails we all lose.\u201d",
