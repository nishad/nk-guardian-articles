    "content": "Japan has lodged a protest and warned of grave threats to its security after North Korea launched four ballistic missiles on Monday morning, three of which fell into Japanese waters. The exact type of missile fired was not immediately clear, but South Korea\u2019s military said it was unlikely that they were intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), which can reach the US. An unnamed US official told Reuters that the US saw no indications that an ICBM had been tested. According to the military in Seoul, the North fired the unidentified projectiles shortly after 7.30am local time (2230 GMT Sunday) from the Tongchang-ri region near its border with China. The area is home to the North\u2019s Seohae satellite station, where it has conducted banned long-range rocket launches in recent years. \u201cThe latest launches of ballistic missiles clearly demonstrate evidence of a new threat from North Korea,\u201d the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said. \u201cThe launches are clearly in violation of [UN] security council resolutions. It is an extremely dangerous action.\u201d The missiles flew about 620 miles (1,000km) before landing in the Sea of Japan \u2013 known as the East Sea in Korea \u2013 with three landing in Japan\u2019s \u201cexclusive economic zone\u201d. A fourth splashed down just outside the EEZ. Three of the missiles landed 186-217 miles (300-350km) from the Oga peninsula in Japan\u2019s Akita prefecture, according to the country\u2019s defence minister, Tomomi Inada. Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, called the latest missile launch a \u201cgrave threat to national security\u201d but added that there were no reports of damage to ships or aircraft in the area. South Korea\u2019s acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn said the launches were a direct challenge to the international community. The US also condemned the launch, vowing that Washington was ready to \u201cuse the full range of capabilities at our disposal against this growing threat\u201d. \u201cThe United States strongly condemns the DPRK\u2019s ballistic missile launches tonight, which violate UN security council resolutions explicitly prohibiting North Korea\u2019s launches using ballistic missile technology,\u201d the State Department\u2019s acting spokesman, Mark Toner, said in a statement. He added: \u201cWe remain prepared \u2013 and will continue to take steps to increase our readiness \u2013 to defend ourselves and our allies from attack, and are prepared to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal against this growing threat.\u201d North Korea conducted two nuclear tests and 20 missile launches last year \u2013 a sign, say experts, that the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, is redoubling efforts to develop a nuclear arsenal capable of deterring \u201chostility\u201d from the US and South Korea. In his New Year\u2019s address, Kim claimed that the North was preparing to test fire an ICBM \u2013 a development that would dramatically raise the diplomatic and security stakes for Washington. The US defence secretary, James Mattis, warned last month that any nuclear attack on the US or its allies in the Asia-Pacific would trigger an \u201ceffective and overwhelming\u201d response. North Korea has carried out five nuclear tests and dozens of missile launches despite six rounds of UN sanctions that began after Pyongyang\u2019s first nuclear test in 2006. Concern is growing that with every new test, North Korea is edging towards developing a fully functioning ICBM that, in theory, could strike the US mainland. Donald Trump\u2019s administration has yet to publicly articulate its policy towards North Korea beyond voicing support for its alliances with Japan and South Korea, home to tens of thousands of US troops. The US president has previously described North Korea as a \u201cbig, big problem\u201d. Monday\u2019s tests were the second North Korea has conducted since Trump became president. Early last month, it test-launched a new intermediate-range missile \u2013 known as the Pukguksong-2, into the sea to coincide with Trump\u2019s summit with Abe at his Florida estate. \u201cNot only Pukguksong-2 but newer independent strategic weapons will fly high vigorously in the sky off the ground as long as the United States and the puppet regime are going ahead with their nuclear threat to us and an exercise for invasion war against the North,\u201d North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers\u2019 party, said in a commentary last week. Monday\u2019s launches are believed to be in protest at the start last week of huge joint military exercises involving South Korea and the US that North Korea regards as a rehearsal for an invasion. Pyongyang threatened to take \u201cstrong retaliatory measures\u201d after the annual military drills began last Wednesday but did not elaborate. Kim ordered troops to \u201cset up thorough countermeasures of a merciless strike against the enemy\u2019s sudden air assault\u201d, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said. South Korea and the US insist that the Foal Eagle exercises, which will end in late April, are designed to test the allies\u2019 preparedness for a serious military provocation from North Korea. The launches could also be designed to communicate Pyongyang\u2019s anger towards China, coming as Xi Jinping attended the 10-day annual national people\u2019s congress in Beijing. While China is the North\u2019s only main ally and biggest donor and trading partner, Beijing has not attempted to hide its opposition to Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Last month, China announced a suspension of all coal imports from North Korea until the end of the year, depriving Pyongyang of an important source of foreign currency. On Monday China\u2019s foreign ministry said Beijing opposed the missile launch but noted that it had taken place as the US and South Korea were holding \u201clarge-scale military exercises targeting North Korea\u201d. \u201cAll sides should exercise restraint and not do anything to irritate each other to worsen regional tensions,\u201d a spokesman added. Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, urged China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, and the US \u201cto go back to the negotiating table to end wrangles and wrestles and reopen the long stalled six-party talks that once brought the Korean Peninsula nearest to denuclearisation with a settlement acceptable to all\u201d.",
