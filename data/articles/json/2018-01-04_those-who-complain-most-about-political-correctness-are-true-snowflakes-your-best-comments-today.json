    "content": "Discussion today has focused on the questionable opinions of Toby Young, the story on the reopening of the Korean hotline, and Yorkshire and the possibility of devolution. You\u2019ve also been discussing succession in the BBC natural history department when, and if, David Attenborough finally retires and a possible revolt in Yorkshire. To join in you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We\u2019ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. Free speech works both ways \u2013 as Toby Young is finding out Dawn Foster has written that Toby Young seems to be learning \u201cthat free speech includes not only his right to express any opinions that bubble up half-formed into his brain then out on to Twitter, but also protects the right of people to criticise him\u201d. Readers have been exercising their rights below the line. \u2018Those who most vociferously complain about political correctness are the true snowflakes\u2019 It\u2019s always the case with those who attack political correctness, they demand the right to say offensive things (a right they already have, but pretend that they don\u2019t), and argue that no one has a right to not be offended. But when we use the same right of free speech to criticise them, they get all offended and act as if they shouldn\u2019t have to deal with the sort of criticism they so readily dole out. My experience is that it\u2019s those who most vociferously complain about political correctness who are the true snowflakes. They whine about PC culture, but let\u2019s face it, if I want to express myself in a politically correct manner, that is my right, because that\u2019s what free speech means. No one forces me to do it, I do it voluntarily because I was brought up with manners, which is just another word for political correctness. althebald \u2018Anything to report?\u2019: Korean hotline reopens with little to say between foes Readers have been joining the discussion under the story about North and South Korea resuming telephone contact since February 2016. \u2018Really hope these talks take place and the brothers unite\u2019 Really hope these talks take place and the brothers unite. Come to a disarmament deal. America will get the F*** out of there and focus more on its domestic chaos, poverty, homelessness, lack of healthcare and inequality. And hope the rest of the world would follow suit. World would be peaceful. Nepaune Will neglect drive Yorkshire to a Catalan-style revolt? According to Simon Jenkins \u201cone of the fiercest civil wars in England\u2019s debilitated local government scene\u201d is happening in Yorkshire. \u2018Yorkshire is too divided to unite for some woolly notion of \u201cindependence\u201d\u2019 I live in Yorkshire. It\u2019s one of the most factional places I\u2019ve ever lived in. The rivalry between the county\u2019s regions, villages, towns and cities is often quite fierce. Think of the massive divides and entirely different characters of say Hull and Harrogate, York and Bradford, Leeds and Richmond, Barnsley and Whitby, Skipton and Sheffield, Hebdon Bridge and Rotherham \u2013 the list goes on. Yorkshire identity is very localized and diverse given the size and variety of the county \u2013 it\u2019s only brought together in stereotyped simplistic generalizations by people that don\u2019t really know it. Yorkshire is too divided and diverse \u2013 and probably sensible \u2013 to be able to unite in striving for some woolly notion of \u201cindependence\u201d. It already has lots of independent competing Yorkshire identities. harobed64 Who could succeed David Attenborough when he retires? Mark Lawson writes on the contenders to replace David Attenborough after the legendary broadcaster spoke about his possible retirement recently. \u2018Alice Roberts has a serious academic record to add gravitas\u2019 I\u2019d suggest Alice Roberts. Although shifting from her medical/anatomy and palaeo/osteo archaeology sweet spot into general biology is a bit of an ask, she\u2019s still a lot more qualified than many on this list. She\u2019s very easy to listen to, has that enthusiasm and warmth you need, and is smiley and upbeat, but has a serious academic track record to add gravitas. Personally I really like Chris Packham and his incredible depth of knowledge, but I fear too many other people don\u2019t. Battingnumber10 Comments have been edited for length.
