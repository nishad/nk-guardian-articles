    "content": "North Korea says it has tested a powerful hydrogen bomb that can be loaded on to an intercontinental ballistic missile, in a move that is expected to increase pressure on Donald Trump to defuse the growing nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula. In an announcement carried on state TV, North Korea said the test, its sixth since 2006, had been a \u201ccomplete success\u201d and involved a \u201ctwo-stage thermonuclear weapon\u201d with \u201cunprecedented\u201d strength. There has been no independent verification of the North\u2019s claims that it has achieved a key goal in its nuclear programme - the ability to miniaturise a warhead so that it can fit on a long-distance missile. Hours earlier, the regime released footage of what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb that would be loaded on to a new ICBM. The TV announcement \u2013 accompanied by patriotic music and images of North Korean scenery and military hardware \u2013 said the test had been ordered by the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. The explosion was heralded by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake about six miles (10km) from North Korea\u2019s Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the north-east of the country. It was felt over the Chinese border in Yanji. South Korea\u2019s meteorological administration estimated the blast yield at between 50 to 60 kilotons, or five to six times stronger than North Korea\u2019s fifth test in September last year. Kim Young-woo, the head of South Korea\u2019s parliamentary defence committee said later that the yield was as high as 100 kilotons. One kiloton is equivalent to 1,000 tons of TNT. The previous nuclear blast in North Korea is estimated by experts to have been about 10 kilotons. Sunday\u2019s test \u2013 the first since Trump took office in January \u2013 offers further evidence that North Korea is moving perilously close to developing a nuclear warhead capable of being fitted on to an ICBM that can strike the US mainland. Since it conducted its first nuclear test just over a decade ago, the regime has strived to refine the bombs\u2019 design and reliability, as well as increasing their yield. Hydrogen bombs are far more powerful than the atomic weapons the North is believed to have tested so far. Whatever its eventual yield, Sunday\u2019s test was \u201ca staged thermonuclear weapon\u201d that represents a significant advance in Pyongyang\u2019s weapons programme, said Jeffrey Lewis of the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies. As the US and countries in the region analysed data resulting from the quake, Japan\u2019s government was the first to state publicly that it was confident the shockwaves came from an underground nuclear explosion in North Korea. The US Geological Survey and China\u2019s Earthquake Administration said they had detected a suspected explosion that caused a 6.3-magnitude earthquake. The USGS said the tremor was located 24km north-east of Sungjibaegam in North Hamgyeong province. \u201cIt\u2019s an explosion rather than an earthquake,\u201d said Jana Pursley, a USGS geophysicist. The Chinese earthquake administration said in a statement on its website that the shock, which occurred around 11.30am local time, was recorded at a depth of zero metres. China\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement: \u201cThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has once again conducted a nuclear test in spite of widespread opposition from the international community. The Chinese government resolutely opposes and strongly condemns it.\u201d South Korea was convening an emergency meeting of its national security council to discuss the possible cause of the quake, according to local media. Japan\u2019s government said it would lodge a strong protest pending confirmation that the quakes were caused by nuclear tests. \u201cIf North Korea has indeed gone ahead with a nuclear test, it is completely unacceptable and we must lodge a strong protest,\u201d said the prime minister, Shinzo Abe. His defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said \u201csniffer\u201d planes capable of detecting radioactive fallout had been deployed to monitor the aftermath of the blast. \u201cWe\u2019ll do our best to collect information,\u201d he said, according to public broadcaster NHK. South Korea\u2019s meteorological administration later challenged reports that a second earthquake had occurred near the same nuclear test site. Earlier reports citing China\u2019s earthquake agency said a second quake had been detected eight minutes after the first. The agency later said the second tremor could have been caused by a cave-in near the underground nuclear test site. Zhang Zhiyuan, a journalist for the Chinese newspaper Yanji News, said he had felt the earthquake caused by the nuclear blast. \u201cI was having lunch in a restaurant when the lights just started shaking,\u201d Zhang, who lives and works near China\u2019s border with North Korea, told the Guardian. \u201cPeople here have all run outside of their apartments.\u201d Trump last month threatened to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d against the regime if it continued to threaten the US and its allies with ballistic missiles. In a telephone call on Sunday morning Japan time, Trump and Abe \u201creaffirmed the importance of close cooperation between the United States, Japan, and South Korea in the face of the growing threat from North Korea\u201d, according to a statement. Sunday\u2019s tests again demonstrated North Korea\u2019s ability to skirt sanctions targeting its missile and weapons technology. UN security council measures ban the regime from testing nuclear or ballistic missile technology, but that did not prevent it from carrying out two nuclear tests and launching more than 20 ballistic missiles last year alone. North Korea in 2016 conducted its fourth and fifth nuclear tests, saying the fourth in January that year was a successful hydrogen bomb test, although experts questioned whether it was a fully fledged hydrogen bomb. The fifth nuclear test, in September 2016, was measured to be possibly North Korea\u2019s biggest detonation ever, but the earthquake it caused was still not believed to be big enough to indicate a full thermonuclear test. The regime detonated its first nuclear device in 2006, followed by tests in 2009 and 2013. Hours before reports of Sunday\u2019s nuclear test emerged, the regime said it had developed a more advanced nuclear weapon that had \u201cgreat destructive power\u201d, and that Kim had inspected a hydrogen bomb that would be loaded on to a new ICBM. Pyongyang test launched two ICBM-class missiles in July that potentially had a range of about 10,000km (6,200 miles), putting the mainland US within reach. Under Kim, North Korea has defied several rounds of UN sanctions and ploughed resources into building working nuclear weapons and missiles with enough range to deliver them as far away as the US mainland \u2013 a development that would considerably strengthen Pyongyang\u2019s hand in any negotiations with Washington. The North\u2019s official KCNA news agency said the hydrogen bomb showcased in photographs at the weekend was adjustable to hundreds of kilotons in explosive power and could be detonated at high altitudes, with its indigenously produced components allowing the country to build as many nuclear weapons as it wants. Kim visited the country\u2019s Nuclear Weapons Institute and \u201cwatched an H-bomb to be loaded into new ICBM\u201d, KCNA said. \u201cAll components of the H-bomb were homemade and all the processes \u2026 were put on the Juche basis, thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants,\u201d said the KCNA. Juche is North Korea\u2019s homegrown go-it-alone ideology that is a mix of Marxism and extreme nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il-sung, the current leader\u2019s grandfather. Kim had \u201cset forth tasks to be fulfilled in the research into nukes\u201d, KCNA said, but it made no mention of plans for a sixth nuclear test. Sunday\u2019s nuclear detonation is expected to raise pressure on the US to address the demonstrable advances the North is making in its missile and weapons development. While it is difficult to independently verify North Korean claims about its missile and nuclear weapons programmes, no one doubts that it is improving its capability with each new test. However, the extent of its ability to consistently miniaturise nuclear warheads so they can fit on long-range missiles remains unclear. \u201cThough we cannot verify the claim, (North Korea) wants us to believe that it can launch a thermonuclear strike now, if it is attacked,\u201d Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told Associated Press. \u201cImportantly [North Korea] will also want to test this warhead, probably at a larger yield, to demonstrate this capability.\u201d Trump has said that all options remain on the table, but last week appeared to rule out any contact with the regime, declaring: \u201cTalking is not the answer.\u201d Other administration officials quickly stressed that dialogue with the regime was still the preferred option. James Mattis, the defence secretary, flatly contradicted the president\u2019s statement, telling reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re never out of diplomatic solutions.\u201d With additional reporting by Wang Zhen in Beijing.",
