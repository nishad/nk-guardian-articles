    "content": "The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has issued a fresh challenge to Donald Trump by conducting a second ballistic missile test-launch which experts said placed US cities in range of potential attack. The missile launch was meant as a \u201cstern warning\u201d for the US, North Korea\u2019s state news agency said. The ICBM, which aimed for \u201cmaximum distance\u201d, flew for 47 minutes and 12 seconds while travelling 998km (620 miles) and reaching a maximum altitude of 3,724.9 meters (12,220ft), the North said. The test was ordered by the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, who was cited as saying that the launch reaffirmed the reliability of the country\u2019s ICBM system and an ability to fire at \u201crandom regions and locations at random times\u201d with the \u201centire\u201d US mainland now within range. Kim said the launch sent a \u201cserious warning\u201d to the US, which has been \u201cmeaninglessly blowing its trumpet\u201d with threats of war and stronger sanctions, the news agency said. The launch on Friday from Chagang province came less than a month after Pyongyang claimed to have tested its first ICBM. US officials told NBC the missile had flown for about 1,000km and had landed within Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone. \u201cWe assess that this missile was an intercontinental ballistic missile, as had been expected,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said in a statement. \u201cThe missile was launched from Mupyong-ni and traveled about 1,000km before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. We are working with our interagency partners on a more detailed assessment,\u201d he said. Melissa Hanham, an expert in North Korea\u2019s missile program from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said the test showed that \u201cAlaska was in range\u201d and a 45-minute test flight suggested it could reach New York City. Jeffrey Lewis of the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies said the launch showed Los Angeles was within range of a North Korean missile, but that Chicago, New York City and Washington DC remained just out of reach. \u201cThey may not have demonstrated the full range. The computer models suggest it can hit all of those targets,\u201d he said. In a telephone conversation after the test, the heads of the US and South Korean militaries discussed \u201cmilitary response options\u201d, the Pentagon said. Gen Joe Dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Adm Harry Harris, who heads the US military\u2019s Pacific command, spoke with the chair of South Korea\u2019s joint chiefs of staff, Gen Lee Sun Jin. Japan led the international condemnation of North Korea\u2019s latest launch, which appeared to have been timed to mark commemorations of the end of Korean war in 1953. \u201cThis clearly shows the threat to our nation\u2019s safety is severe and real,\u201d said Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, vowing to do \u201cour utmost to protect the safety of the Japanese people\u201d. \u201cWe cannot accept these repeated provocations by North Korea,\u201d Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters. South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, chaired an national security council meeting in the early hours of Saturday. The defence minister, Song Young-moo, later said Seoul would prepare independent measures to curb the North\u2019s nuclear threat. \u201cAlong with joint efforts to deter proliferation we will prepare independent measures to curb it as soon as possible,\u201d Song told a press conference in Seoul. The United Nations secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, condemned the launch of a \u201cballistic missile of possible intercontinental range\u201d, his spokesman said in a statement. Russia \u2013 which maintains warm diplomatic relations with Pyongyang \u2013 disputed the US and Japanese description of the missile, saying it appeared to be a \u201cmedium-range\u201d weapon, not an ICBM. Earlier this month, Moscow blocked a UN security council statement condemning North Korea\u2019s last missile launch because it said that rocket was also medium-range, despite assertions by the US and Pyongyang. Beijing offered no immediate reaction but L\u00fc Chao, a Chinese North Korea expert, told the state-run Global Times newspaper that his government would \u201cfirmly oppose the launch since it intensified regional tension \u2026 and jeopardised the situation in north-east Asia\u201d. North Korea\u2019s latest missile test came hours after Kim Jong-un had visited a military cemetery to mark the 64th anniversary of the 1953 armistice. A test had been expected to mark that anniversary. However, Hanham said the timing and the location of the launch were highly unusual because Pyongyang usually conducted such tests shortly after dawn, not late at night, and had not previously launched a missile from Chagang province. Details of the launch remained sketchy but Hanham said she suspected the missile being tested was the same Hwasong-14 projectile that Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime had launched on 4 July. \u201cThat test showed that Alaska was in range \u2026 [and] my preliminary guess is that they are now testing this missile to see whether it can go further. We need to get all the data points to be able to calculate the range curve but it is possible that they are trying to demonstrate that indeed New York is not that far away.\u201d A range of 9,500-10,000km (5,900-6,200 miles) \u2013 which a 45-minute flight time suggested was possible \u2013 meant North Korea could potentially strike at east coast targets such as New York City, Hanham pointed out. Analysts remain skeptical as to whether North Korea has the ability to miniaturise a nuclear weapon that could be fired on such a missile. Even so, the launch is the latest reminder of Trump\u2019s failure to advance in his bid to rein in Kim\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Experts say the US president had hoped to form a \u201cbig marriage\u201d with China, which would have seen the world\u2019s top two economies tackle Pyongyang together, with Beijing putting economic pressure on its ally. However the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, fearing the impact the collapse of Kim\u2019s regime would have on China, has appeared unwilling to enter into such a partnership. Following North Korea\u2019s ICBM test in early July, Beijing rejected Trump\u2019s calls for it to do more, claiming the \u201cChina responsibility theory\u201d had to stop. Pyongyang, meanwhile, has continued its rhetorical war against Washington. \u201cIf enemies misunderstand our strategic status and stick to options of staging a pre-emptive nuclear attack against us, we will launch a nuclear attack on America\u2019s heart as the most relentless punishment without warning or prior notice,\u201d the head of North Korea\u2019s armed forces, Pak Yong-sik, told state media earlier this week. Hanham said Friday night\u2019s test would be a major headache for a White House already reeling from the dramatic defeat of the healthcare repeal bill that morning. \u201cWashington is very busy with other things right now, unfortunately. The healthcare vote was an incredible blow to the Republican party. I suspect that many in office are licking their wounds today,\u201d she said. \u201cThe US state department is not fully staffed. I don\u2019t think they are staffed up for this event.\u201d",
