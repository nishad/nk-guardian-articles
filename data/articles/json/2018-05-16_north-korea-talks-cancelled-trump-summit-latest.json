    "content": "North Korea has abruptly cancelled high-level talks with Seoul and threatened to pull out of a planned summit with Donald Trump if the US continues to insist on the regime giving up all of its nuclear weapons. A North Korean official said the country had no interest in a summit with US if it was based on \u201cone-sided\u201d demands to give up nuclear weapons, according to state media. Citing first vice minister of foreign affairs Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea\u2019s central news agency also said the fate of the US summit as well as bilateral relations \u201cwould be clear\u201d if Washington speaks of a Libya-style denuclearisation for the North. The statement added Trump would remain as a \u201cfailed president\u201d if he followed in the steps of his predecessors. \u201cWe will appropriately respond to the Trump administration if it approaches the North Korea-US summit meeting with a truthful intent to improve relations,\u201d Kim said. He added: \u201cBut we are no longer interested in a negotiation that will be all about driving us into a corner and making a one-sided demand for us to give up our nukes and this would force us to reconsider whether we would accept the North Korea-US summit meeting.\u201d The statement came after North Korea cancelled a meeting with South Korean officials just two hours before it was due to start on Wednesday, in protest at joint US-South Korean military exercises, codenamed Max Thunder. The drills, which began on Friday, involve about 100 warplanes from the US and South Korea, including eight F-22 stealth fighters and an unspecified number of B-52 bombers. Yonhap news agency quoted an unnamed source as saying that a B-52 bomber, which has yet to join the drills, may not participate, in what could be interpreted as a concession to Pyongyang. But South Korea\u2019s defence ministry said exercises will continue, saying they were strictly defensive in nature and designed to help pilots improve their skills. Max Thunder is one of several annual exercises involving the US and South Korean military that are routinely condemned by the North as preparation for an invasion. South Korea\u2019s defence minister, Song Young-moo, was to hold an emergency meeting with Gen Vincent Brooks, the commander of US Forces Korea, to discuss the allies\u2019 response to the North\u2019s protest. For North Korea, the presence of bombers in joint US-South Korea drills triggers painful memories of the 1950-53 Korean war. According to US air force estimates, bombing raids by US B-29s caused more damage to North Korea\u2019s urban centres during that conflict than that seen in Germany or Japan during the second world war, with the US dumping 635,000 tons of bombs on Korea compared with 503,000 tons during the entire Pacific war. Baik Tae-hyun, a spokesman for South Korea\u2019s unification ministry, described Pyongyang\u2019s decision as \u201cregrettable\u201d and said it ran counter to the \u201cspirit and purpose\u201d of the Panmunjom declaration agreed by Kim and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, last month. Baik urged the North to swiftly return to the talks but would not speculate on whether the North\u2019s move would affect next month\u2019s planned meeting between Kim and Trump. KCNA said the manoeuvres represented a \u201cflagrant challenge\u201d to the joint declaration by Kim and Moon at a summit at the \u201ctruce village\u201d of Panmunjom on the dividing line between their countries in April. The two leaders agreed to completely \u201ccease all hostile acts against each other in every domain, including land, air and sea, that are the source of military tension and conflict\u201d. The state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said the US had not heard directly from North Korea about any second thoughts. \u201cWhat we have to go on is what Kim Jong-un has said before, that he understands and appreciates the importance to the United States of having these joint exercises,\u201d Nauert said. \u201cWe have had no formal or informal notification of anything.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to plan the meeting.\u201d Kim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Korea national diplomatic academy in Seoul, said: \u201cNorth Korea knows that cancelling the (Trump-Kim) summit would not be good for its own interests, and not good for US interests either. But the North Korean regime cannot accept US demands for denuclearisation without first receiving guarantees about its security. Let\u2019s see what Trump does about this.\u201d In its complaint about the exercises, the Pyongyang regime described them as offensive war games targeting North Korea. A Pentagon spokesman, Col Rob Manning, said they were defensive. US and South Korean officials had previously said that North Korea would accept joint military exercises in the run-up to the Trump summit. The Panmunjom summit was supposed to have been followed by a meeting of senior officials from the two Koreas on Wednesday to implement a declaration agreed by Moon and Kim. The agenda included issues such as a formal end to the Korean war, denuclearisation and reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 conflict. \u201cThe North Koreans know how to make an explicit threat. By their standards, this is pretty circumspect,\u201d said Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists. \u201cIt could very well be a play for additional leverage or to see how the Trump team reacts.\u201d Mintaro Oba, a former state department expert on Korea, said in a tweet: \u201cThe question is whether they\u2019re willing to go so far as to go through with it, or whether they\u2019re mainly trying to gain some leverage [and] test how much we want the summit.\u201d Meanwhile, satellite photos suggest that the North Korean leadership is so far following through on its promise to dismantle its nuclear test site at Punggye-ri. Pictures published by 38 North, a website analysing Korean issues, several buildings around the mountain site have been razed in recent days.",
