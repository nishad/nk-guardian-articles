    "content": "North Korea has sent the Australian government a \u201crant about how bad Donald Trump is\u201d, the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has said. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, also confirmed the existence of the \u201cunprecedented\u201d letter on Friday, and claimed it demonstrated that the global sanctions regime against the rogue state was working. In September Trump used a speech to the United Nations to threaten to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea \u201cif [the US] is forced to defend ourselves or our allies\u201d. The North Korean letter, published in full by Fairfax Media, labels that threat an \u201cextreme act of threatening to destroy the entire world\u201d. \u201cIf Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,\u201d the letter says. The letter says North Korea is a \u201cfull-fledged nuclear power\u201d with \u201cvarious kinds of nuclear delivery\u201d. It urges other nations to restrain the \u201cheinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster\u201d. The letter claims that from his first day in office \u201cTrump has engaged himself in high-handed and arbitrary practice, scrapping international laws and agreements incurring his displeasure on the US-first principle\u201d. It calls Trump\u2019s America First mantra \u201cthe height of [the] American way of thinking that it is best if the US is well off at at the expense of the whole world\u201d. The letter labels the international sanctions regime \u201cillegal\u201d, accusing the UN security council of breaching the UN charter and North Korea\u2019s right to \u201cnormal economic development\u201d. Speaking to 3AW Radio on Friday, Turnbull said the letter \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually say anything about Australia so much, it\u2019s basically a rant about how bad Donald Trump is\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve sent it to a lot of other countries, like a circular letter,\u201d he said. Turnbull said the letter was \u201cconsistent with [North Korea\u2019s] ranting and complaining about Donald Trump\u201d. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that North Korea is the one who is in in breach of UN security council resolutions. It\u2019s North Korea that is threatening to fire nuclear missiles at Japan, at South Korea, at the US ... threatening the stability of the world. \u201cThat\u2019s the regime that has to return to its senses, to stop this reckless conduct, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re imposing sanctions.\u201d Turnbull has strongly backed the US on North Korea, saying he is \u201cof one mind\u201d with Trump on the conflict and committing Australia to be involved in any conflict in the event North Korea attacks the US. Turnbull said he believed the letter was a sign sanctions were working, and gave \u201cgreat credit\u201d to China for restricting oil exports to North Korea. \u201cThe tighter the economic sanctions are applied, the greater prospect we have of resolving that situation without a conflict.\u201d At a press conference, Bishop said it was \u201cunprecedented\u201d to communicate with the Australian government in this way, noting it is \u201cnot the way they usually publish their global messages\u201d. \u201cThe collective strategy of imposing maximum diplomatic and economic pressure through sanctions on North Korea is working,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a response to the pressure.\u201d Bishop said North Korea was trying to \u201cdivide those who are committed to ending its illegal nuclear weapons testing and ballistic missile testing\u201d. \u201cThis is evidence, I believe, that our collective international strategy is working.\u201d",
