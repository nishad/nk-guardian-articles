    "content": "North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un, has invited the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to visit Pyongyang at the \u201cearliest date possible\u201d for what would be the first summit between the two nations in more than a decade. Kim Yo-jong, the sister of the North Korean leader, made the overture during a lunch at Seoul\u2019s presidential palace. She is the first member of Pyongyang\u2019s ruling dynasty to set foot in the South since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. Kim Yong-nam, North Korea\u2019s ceremonial head of state, also attended the meeting. The two sides discussed inter-Korean relations, according to the Yonhap news agency, and Moon responded to the invitation by saying: \u201cLet us make it happen by creating the necessary conditions in the future.\u201d Moon has previously said he is willing to travel to Pyongyang, but the US is likely to oppose such a trip as Washington pursues a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d. Moon also stressed the need for the US to come to the table. \u201cAn early resumption of dialogue between the United States and the North is needed also for the development of the South-North Korean relationship,\u201d Moon said, according to a spokesman. There has been a dramatic cooling of tensions on the Korean peninsula in the past two months and Moon has made it clear he hopes the rapprochement can continue after the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang ends. After the lunch, at which the pair ate kimchi and drank soju liquor, it was announced that Moon and Kim Yong-nam would attend the combined Korea women\u2019s ice hockey match together on Saturday night. The two men will cheer the team made up of players from both countries, the first ever unified team. But in a sign that Kim Jong-un is unlikely to give up his nuclear arms, he used the day before the Olympics opening ceremony to stage a massive military parade that included trucks carrying intercontinental ballistic missiles \u2013 weapons that could be capable of striking the US mainland. Saturday\u2019s meeting between the two neighbours \u2013 technically still at war \u2013 is the first since 2007 when North Korea\u2019s premier visited the presidential palace. The delegation of 22 officials from the North arrived on Friday in order to attend the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics. \u201cYou must have had a hard time due to the cold weather,\u201d Moon said as he greeted Kim Yo-jong, referring to the frigid temperatures during Friday\u2019s opening ceremony. \u201cIt was OK because you, Mr President, were kind enough to care,\u201d Kim Yo-jong replied, according to Yonhap news agency. The warm reception was at odds with the position taken by US vice-president, Mike Pence. He refused to acknowledge Kim Yong-nam during a brief stop at a dinner on Friday night and remained seated when athletes from North and South Korea marched in the opening ceremony. He said the US would take whatever \u201caction is necessary to defend our homeland\u201d against the North Korean nuclear threat, according to NBC. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to put all the pressure to bear economically and diplomatically, while preserving all of our military options to see that that happens,\u201d Pence said.",
