    "content": "As they always do on the anniversary of the armistice, North Koreans celebrated their \u201cvictory\u201d in the Korean War on 27 July. A few days later, President Donald J Trump remarked that if the North Koreans made any more threats, they \u201cwill be met with fire and fury, and frankly, power the likes of which the world has never seen\u201d. No American president has uttered words like this since Harry Truman warned the Japanese, between Hiroshima and Nagasaki, either to surrender or face \u201ca rain of ruin from the air, the likes of which has never been seen on this earth\u201d. Trump\u2019s nuclear bluster, made off-the-cuff between golf rounds, was widely condemned, but a few days later he doubled down on it. As a White House staffer told the New York Times, the president \u201cbelieves he has a better feel for Mr Kim [Jong-un] than his advisers do. He thinks of Mr Kim as someone pushing people around, and Mr Trump thinks he needs to show that he cannot be pushed.\u201d Trump is surrounded by people who echo his fantasies of ultimate power. Sebastian Gorka, a strange figure advising Trump (said to be a Trump \u201cfavorite\u201d and a dead ringer for a Bela Lugosi flunky in a Dracula movie), told Fox News that Trump\u2019s \u201cfire and fury\u201d line meant \u201cdon\u2019t test America and don\u2019t test Donald J Trump\u201d. We are not just a superpower, Gorka went on, \u201cwe are now a hyper-power. Nobody in the world, especially not North Korea, comes close to challenging our military capabilities.\u201d This has been a truism since the Soviet Union collapsed, but it doesn\u2019t explain how the US has failed to win four of the five major wars it has fought since 1945. One of those wars was indd Korea, where rough peasant armies, North Korean and Chinese, fought the US to a standstill. It was 64 years ago that North Koreans emerged from this war into a living nightmare, after three years of \u201crain and ruin\u201d by the US air force. Pyongyang had been razed to the ground, with the Air Force stating in official documents that the North\u2019s cities suffered greater damage than German and Japanese cities firebombed during World War II. Just as the Japan scholar Richard Minear termed Truman\u2019s atomic attacks \u201cexterminationist\u201d, the great French writer and film-maker Chris Marker wrote after a visit to the North in 1957: \u201cExtermination crossed this land.\u201d It was an indelible experience still drilled into the heads of every North Korean. On my first visit to Pyongyang in 1981, a guide quickly brought up the bombing and said it had killed several of his family members. Wall posters depicted a wizened old woman in the midst of the bombing, declaring \u201cAmerican imperialists \u2013 wolves\u201d. The day after Trump\u2019s bluster, the DPRK government stated: \u201cThe US once waged a tragic war that plunged this land into a sea of blood and fire, and has been leaving no stone unturned to obliterate the DPRK\u2019s ideology and system century after century.\u201d There are 25 million human beings living in North Korea. They bleed like we do, they live and die like we do, they love their kin like we do. Trump\u2019s callous and cavalier threat was perhaps the most irresponsible thing he has said since becoming president (which is really saying something), but most Americans will not know this because they know nothing about the carpet-bombing of North Korea. What about the 50 million South Koreans, whose elders also suffered through this war? \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t seem to understand what an alliance is, and doesn\u2019t seem to consider his ally when he says those things,\u201d Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at an institute in Seoul, told the New York Times. \u201cNo American president has mentioned a military option so easily, so offhandedly as he has.\u201d But here Trump has a precedent: Bill Clinton also didn\u2019t bother to consult the former South Korean president Kim Young Sam when drawing up plans for a pre-emptive strike in June 1994. The next few weeks are critical to this deepening crisis, with annual \u201cUlchi-Freedom Guardian\u201d war games set to start up on 21 August, involving tens of thousands of American and South Korean troops. North Korean generals have been preparing for moments like this for decades, gaming out war scenarios during several crises going back to January 1968 when they seized the US spy ship Pueblo and held the crew for 11 months. Thus the North\u2019s statements in the current crisis (unlike Trump\u2019s) have a concrete, predictable nature: lots of bluster and bombast combined with quite specific plans, namely four medium-range missiles to be launched into waters near Guam on 15 August, if Kim Jong Un gives the go ahead. Pyongyang always pursues tit-for-tat strategies: the US lifts B1-B nuclear-capable bombers from Guam for flyovers of South Korea \u2013 a constant not just under Trump but also during Obama\u2019s tenure \u2013 and the North chooses a scenario that will call attention to the nuclear blackmail that the US has pursued going back to the Korean war, and particularly during the decades from 1958 to 1990, when the US stationed hundreds of nukes in South Korea with standard plans to use them in the early stages of a North Korean invasion. Pyongyang also likes to choose dates that have historical resonance: 15 August is the anniversary of Korea\u2019s liberation from Japanese colonialism in 1945. Upon the news of his wife\u2019s death, Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth said, \u201cOut, out, brief candle! Life\u2019s but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury.\u201d He famously added: \u201csignifying nothing\u201d. Trump signified this: yet another American venture in extermination.
