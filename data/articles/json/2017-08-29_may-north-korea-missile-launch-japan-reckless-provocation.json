    "content": "North Korea\u2019s launch of a missile over Japan amounted to \u201creckless provocation\u201d and could spark fresh sanctions against the country, Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has said. The prime minister is due to arrive in Japan on Wednesday, where she will meet her Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe. The UK will be among nations discussing possible new sanctions at the UN in New York later on Tuesday, she said. \u201cThe prime minister is outraged by North Korea\u2019s reckless provocation, and she strongly condemns these illegal tests,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cFrom our perspective we will need to continue to work with our international partners to keep the pressure on North Korea.\u201d The Japanese public broadcaster NHK said the missile was launched from a site near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and passed over a sparsely populated area of Hokkaido, the most northern of Japan\u2019s main islands, just after 6am local time. The missile, which broke into three parts and landed in the sea, prompted Japan\u2019s J-Alert warning system to advise people across a large area of northern Japan to seek shelter. Officials in South Korea said the missile may have flown further than any other tested by North Korea. Abe called the launch an \u201cunprecedented and grave threat\u201d to Japan\u2019s security, and arranged in a phone call with Donald Trump for an emergency meeting of the UN security council. May\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency meeting of the UN security council later today, at which the UK will be represented. And obviously, over the next three days the prime minister will have quite a lot of time with Prime Minister Abe to discuss, among other things, North Korea.\u201d \u201cThere was a round of sanction agreed unanimously in early August. We expect that new sanctions measures will be discussed at the UN security council later today, so we\u2019ll see what emerges from that.\u201d Asked if the UK would be pressing for new sanctions, the spokeswoman said: \u201cOur permanent representative will be attending. There\u2019s been discussions in Japan between our embassy and officials there. We\u2019ll see what comes out of that meeting later today.\u201d The missile was the third fired by North Korea to have passed over Japanese territory. The first was in 1998 and the second in 2009, although Pyongyang claims they were satellites. May\u2019s spokeswoman said the missile firing would not affect her trip to Japan: \u201cThere aren\u2019t any changes to her visit plans. Talks on North Korea were planned to be high on the agenda and they will continue to be.\u201d Asked whether the UK had sought reassurance from Japan as to whether the visit should continue, she said: \u201cAhead of an international trip we would be in constant contact with officials in the country that we\u2019re visiting. We\u2019re going on the trip and our plans haven\u2019t changed at all.\u201d",
