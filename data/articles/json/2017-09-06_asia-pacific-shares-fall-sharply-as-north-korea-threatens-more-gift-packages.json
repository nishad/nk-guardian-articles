    "content": "The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has warned that the crisis on the Korean peninsula risks becoming \u201cuncontrollable\u201d as he sought Russian cooperation in a meeting with Vladimir Putin. \u201cThe global political situation has become very serious due to North Korea\u2019s repeated provocations,\u201d Moon told the Russian president during bilateral talks in Vladivostok on Wednesday. According to South Korean media, Moon asked Putin to help \u201ctame\u201d North Korea, as the international community considers its response to Pyongyang\u2019s sixth nuclear test on Sunday. There was further evidence that North Korea had made significant progress in its nuclear programme, with Japan saying it had revised upwards the estimated yield from Sunday\u2019s bomb to 160 kilotons \u2013 making it more than 10 times bigger than the Hiroshima bomb. \u201cThis is far more powerful than their nuclear tests in the past,\u201d Japan\u2019s defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, told reporters. The figure was based on a revised magnitude by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation. Japan\u2019s revised estimate is far greater than the 50-100 kiloton yield given by the UN security council. The council is due to vote on Monday on a resolution condemning the North\u2019s recent test, but there are signs of division over how to respond. Putin has said he opposes fresh economic measures against the regime. While he condemned North Korea\u2019s provocations, Putin said further sanctions would be useless and ineffective, describing the measures as a \u201croad to nowhere\u201d. China, too, opposes any measure \u2013 namely an oil embargo favoured by the US and Japan \u2013 that could foment a domestic crisis big enough to topple North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, and potentially end the country\u2019s status as a buffer between China and South Korea, where US forces are based. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, is expected to broach sanctions with Putin when they meet in Vladivostok on Thursday. \u201cWe have to make North Korea change its current policy and understand that there is no bright future if North Korea continues the present policy,\u201d Abe told reporters before he left Tokyo. The US president, Donald Trump, said military action against North Korea was not a first choice after what he called a strong and frank discussion with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, about the issue. \u201cPresident Xi would like to do something. We\u2019ll see whether or not he can do it. But we will not be putting up with what\u2019s happening in North Korea,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cI believe that President Xi agrees with me 100% ... We had a very, very frank and very strong phone call.\u201d In a flurry of phone calls with world leaders, Trump earlier took a tough line against negotiating with North Korea. Trump stressed \u201cnow is not the time to talk to North Korea\u201d and that \u201call options remain open to defend the United States and its allies\u201d, according to a White House description of his telephone call with Theresa May. Trump also discussed North Korea with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Trump and Turnbull \u201cconfirmed that their two countries will intensify joint efforts to denuclearise North Korea\u201d. The UK defence secretary, Michael Fallon, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday: \u201cThe US is perfectly entitled to make all the preparations it needs to protect its people, its bases, its own homeland. They are clearly doing that at the moment to make sure the president has all options he needs.\u201d He said the US defence secretary, James Mattis, \u201cand I and others across the administration have made it clear we have to absolutely exhaust every possible diplomatic avenue to get this situation under control\u201d. \u201cThat means working intensively in New York over the next few days to get a new resolution. It means looking at the existing sanctions and making sure they\u2019re properly enforced. It means looking at the European Union level and seeing what sanctions can be applied there and above all it means putting more pressure on China to deal with its neighbour. This last test was just 50 miles from the border of China.\u201d Geopolitical concerns continued to simmer following the nuclear test on Sunday, with one of North Korea\u2019s most senior diplomats saying the US would receive more \u201cgift packages\u201d from the regime. Han Tae-song, the country\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, confirmed that North Korea had successfully conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test on Sunday. \u201cThe recent self-defence measures by my country \u2026 are a gift package addressed to none other than the US,\u201d Han told a disarmament conference in Geneva on Tuesday. \u201cThe US will receive more gift packages \u2026 as long as it relies on reckless provocations and futile attempts to put pressure on [North Korea].\u201d Tensions between the US and North Korea continued to take their toll on markets in the region on Wednesday. The Nikkei share average fell 0.7% to a four-month low in Tokyo in early trading but had mounted a slight recovery by mid-afternoon. In Sydney, the ASX200 benchmark index plunged by the same margin as investors opted for safe havens such as gold and government bonds. The South Korean benchmark index \u2013 the Kospi \u2013 was 0.35% lower on Wednesday in the fifth successive day of losses. Shanghai dropped 0.4% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng retreated 1%.",
