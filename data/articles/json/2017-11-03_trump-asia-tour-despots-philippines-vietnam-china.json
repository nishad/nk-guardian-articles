    "content": "Expect to hear a lot of talk in the coming days about the existential threat posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and China\u2019s unfair trade practices, vis a vis the US. The occasion is Donald Trump\u2019s forthcoming 11-day, five-country visit to Asia \u2013 he leaves Washington on Friday for Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. If White House officials have their way, these two \u201cAmerica First\u201d themes will dominate the trip. What you will hear considerably less about are the appalling human rights records of Trump\u2019s hosts \u2013 and his abandonment of almost any pretence of upholding \u201cwestern values\u201d such as open, democratic governance. It\u2019s true his recent Oval Office predecessors were all guilty, to varying degrees, of double standards on rights. But Trump\u2019s studied insouciance plumbs new depths. He seems to have no standards at all. How else to explain his excitement at meeting Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines president whose criminal campaign of extrajudicial slayings of alleged drug dealers and users has won Trump\u2019s public endorsement? In a phone call in May, he praised Duterte for \u201cdoing an unbelievable job on the drug problem\u201d \u2013 a job that, in his first year in office, saw more than 7,000 people unlawfully killed. \u201cI think there\u2019s a warm rapport there and he\u2019s very much looking forward to his first in-person meeting [with Duterte],\u201d a White House briefer said. Duterte\u2019s doleful record includes attacks on political and media critics and his reckless aggravation of the neo-Islamist insurgency in the Bangsamoro, the Muslim areas of the island of Mindanao. Duterte has \u201cunleashed a human rights calamity on the Philippines\u201d, says Human Rights Watch. Trump\u2019s apologists argue that the US president must weigh conflicting considerations. The US wants the Philippines\u2019 backing in opposing North Korea\u2019s regime (whose human rights abuses are also execrable) and Chinese encroachment in the South China Sea. Trump\u2019s two days in Vietnam are likely to follow a similarly unprincipled script. After unilaterally upending the Trans-Pacific Partnership, bilateral trade deals are on his agenda. Enhanced defence, security and intelligence cooperation will also feature, again as a fence against China\u2019s regional importunities. But don\u2019t expect to hear much, if anything, from Trump about how his Vietnamese hosts run a ruthless, one-party communist dictatorship that is the antithesis of all that American democracy stands for; that the regime restricts freedom of speech, media and religion; or that courageous young bloggers who speak their minds are routinely intimidated, assaulted and jailed. The Vietnamese premier, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, made his mark with Trump when he visited the White House in May. The two reportedly see cold eye to eye. Trump\u2019s appeasement of the killer in Manila and the hard men in Hanoi fits an established pattern of fawning behaviour towards dominant, autocratic figures with whom he plainly feels at home. His infatuation with Vladimir Putin is a case in point. His embarrassing excess of admiration for China\u2019s burly strongman president, Xi Jinping, is another. \u201cHe\u2019s a powerful man. I happen to think he\u2019s a very good person,\u201d Trump said of Xi during a Fox News interview last week. \u201cSome people might call him the king of China.\u201d Where does this subservience come from? American analysts seriously worry that a supine Trump, kowtowing ingratiatingly in the presence of Chinese royalty, could end up compromising the future Asia-Pacific balance of power by his desperate need for Xi to like him. Trump is evidently impressed by Xi\u2019s success at last month\u2019s Communist party congress, when he was crowned de facto leader-for-life. Maybe Trump privately believes that as a fellow Leviathan bestriding the world stage, this is his due, too. Yet in practical terms, his position is one of supplicant. He wants China\u2019s help on North Korea. He wants concessions on trade. He hopes for Xi\u2019s good graces. For this if no other reason, Trump will certainly not bother a kindred spirit with complaints about human rights. Yet his personal vanity and weakness notwithstanding, Trump as president bears a responsibility to take a stand. Xi is presiding over what has been termed the biggest curtailment of individual liberties since the era of Mao Zedong. Freedom of expression is ever more closely controlled. Political dissent is deemed akin to treason. In Hong Kong (to a virtually silent Britain\u2019s shame), idealistic young pro-democracy campaigners are cruelly persecuted. Across the country, Christian church leaders and human rights lawyers are detained. UN calls for the repression to cease are ignored. On China\u2019s periphery, the people of Taiwan live under constant threat of attack. This style of brute governance, aped by lesser despots around the world, represents a sustained assault on the universal democratic, human and civil rights for which the US has been a leading advocate since 1945. Trump should get over himself \u2013 and speak out. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs columnist for the Guardian",
