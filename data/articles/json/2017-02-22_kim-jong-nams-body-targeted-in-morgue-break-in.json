    "content": "Malaysian police investigating the murder of Kim Jong-nam say attempts were made to break into the morgue where his body is being held and have demanded to question a senior North Korean diplomat. The announcements by police chief Khalid Abu Bakar throw further suspicion on Pyongyang over the apparent assassination of the exiled half-brother of the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un. Khalid said another man wanted for questioning and identified as Kim Uk-il was linked to North Korea\u2019s state airline, Air Koryo. Both he and the high-level embassy official, named as Hyon Kwang-song, 44, remained in Malaysia, Khalid said. \u201cHe\u2019s the second secretary of the embassy ... They\u2019re not in custody; they\u2019ve been called in for assistance,\u201d Khalid told journalists at a press conference. \u201cWe knew there were attempts by someone to break into the hospital mortuary. We had to take precautions. We will not allow anyone to tamper with the mortuary,\u201d the Malay Mail quoted him as saying. He added that investigators knew who had made the attempted break-in but that there was \u201cno need for me to tell you\u201d. Kim Jong-nam, who lived most of his life outside his home country, died from a seizure en route to hospital nine days ago after complaining that a woman had sprayed chemicals on his face at Kuala Lumpur international airport. Malaysian authorities have arrested four people: a Vietnamese woman, an Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man and a North Korean man. Khalid said police \u201cstrongly believed\u201d four suspects who fled Malaysia on the day of Kim\u2019s death had gone to the North Korean capital. The detained Indonesian woman has said she was duped into playing a role in the killing, believing she was part of a television comedy prank. But Khalid disputed that on Wednesday, saying the suspects were \u201ctrained\u201d and had even practised the attack at different public places, including a major mall in downtown Kuala Lumpur. \u201cYes, the two female suspects knew that the substance they had was toxic. We don\u2019t know what kind of chemical was used,\u201d he said. Samples from an inconclusive autopsy were sent away for lab tests. \u201cThey used their bare hands,\u201d he said, adding that they were instructed to wash their hands afterwards. The killing has led to a diplomatic altercation between North Korea and Malaysia, which until now was one of the few countries keeping open relations with Pyongyang. The North Korean embassy issued a statement on Wednesday demanding the release of its arrested citizen, Ri Jong-chol, and saying that the two women, who are not North Korean nationals, are \u201cinnocent\u201d and should be also be freed. North Korea\u2019s ambassador, Kang Chol, was summoned by the Malaysian foreign ministry on Monday after he accused police of deception. He had demanded that no autopsy take place and the body be released immediately. Kuala Lumpur refused both requests so police could continue their investigation, and have called for a family member of Kim Jong-nam to come forward to claim the body.
