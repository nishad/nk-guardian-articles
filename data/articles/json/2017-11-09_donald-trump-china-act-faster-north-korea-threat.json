    "content": "Donald Trump has lavished praise on the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and blamed his own predecessors for the \u201chuge\u201d trade deficit between the world\u2019s two largest economies, during his official welcome to Beijing amid an explosion of military splendour and staged adulation. Speaking on Thursday at the the Great Hall of the People, the ceremonial heart of Communist party rule, Trump paid tribute to his \u201cwarm and gracious\u201d host, and said he appreciated Xi\u2019s support for recent efforts to rein in North Korea\u2019s weapons programmes. During his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly criticised China, accusing it of \u201craping\u201d the US economy and being the country\u2019s \u201cenemy\u201d. But on the second day of his visit to Beijing as part of his 12-day tour of east Asia, the president struck a far softer tone. \u201cTrade between China and the United States has not been, over the last many, many years, a very fair one for us,\u201d Trump told an audience of business leaders and journalists, describing the relationship as \u201cshockingly\u201d unbalanced and costing the US $300bn (\u00a3229bn) a year. However, to an audible gasp from the audience, the US president went on to suggest that it was not China to blame, but the US itself. \u201cRight now, unfortunately, it is a very one-sided and unfair [relationship]. But \u2013 but \u2013 I don\u2019t blame China. After all, who can blame a country for taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its own citizens? I give China great credit. \u201cBut in actuality I do blame past [US] administrations for allowing this out of control trade deficit to take place and to grow. We have to fix this because it just doesn\u2019t work \u2026 it is just not sustainable.\u201d The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, later tried to clarify Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cWell, as I was sitting there listening to that, there was a little bit of tongue-in-cheek in that characterisation. But there was also a lot of truth to it,\u201d he told reporters. In his eight-minute address, Trump also urged Xi to \u201cact faster and more effectively\u201d to extinguish North Korea\u2019s nuclear \u201cmenace\u201d. \u201cI know one thing about your president: if he works on it hard, it will happen,\u201d the US president added, to laughter. \u201cThere is no doubt about it.\u201d Xi and Trump unveiled more than $250bn in economic deals, a move one Chinese official hailed as \u201ctruly a miracle\u201d, but which sceptics believe were likely to have materialised even without the presidential visit. Earlier, Xi greeted Trump on a red carpet at the eastern steps of the Mao-era Great Hall, observed by members of China\u2019s top leadership and a military guard of honour. The leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies watched a military parade and were greeted by flag-waving schoolchildren from both China and the US. China has painted Trump\u2019s reception as an unusually enthusiastic tribute to a respected foreign friend. On Thursday night, Trump was honoured with a state banquet at which guests were served grouper fillets in chilli oil, coconut-flavoured chicken soup and wines from the Great Wall winery in China\u2019s Hebei province. \u201cAs we often say in China, what a joy it is to have friends come from afar,\u201d Xi said in his toast celebrating \u201cthe friendship between China and the United States\u201d and its \u201cboundless potential for growth\u201d. Trump replied: \u201cIn the words of a Chinese proverb, \u2018We must carry forward the cause and forge ahead into the future.\u2019 \u201cYour ancient values bring past and future together into the present. So beautiful.\u201d Ely Ratner, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, described the US president\u2019s comments on trade as \u201cby far Trump\u2019s biggest mistake so far on Asia trip\u201d. \u201cShameful. Terrible message to American workers and the region. Should be red meat for Democrats,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Ratner said Trump\u2019s VIP treatment was a Chinese attempt to flatter and impress the volatile US leader : \u201cIt\u2019s clearly an effort to try to get him to back off on some of the more punitive actions that the administration is considering on North Korea and trade and investment.\u201d Xi\u2019s attempts to massage Trump\u2019s ego appear to have worked. Speaking at the Great Hall, Trump thanked Xi for his \u201cabsolutely terrific\u201d welcome to China and said he harboured \u201cincredibly warm\u201d feelings towards a man now seen as China\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. \u201cYou are a very special man,\u201d Trump told Xi. Xi was more restrained in his choice of words, although he hailed Trump\u2019s successful and historic visit, and said he hoped the US and China could \u201cwrite more and more great stories\u201d together in the future. The Chinese president did not directly respond to Trump\u2019s call for faster action on North Korea, but told reporters Beijing was committed to solving the crisis \u201cthrough dialogue and negotiation\u201d. \u201cWe are ready to discuss with relevant parties the pathway leading to enduring peace and stability on the peninsula and in north-east Asia.\u201d Xi also played down tensions between Beijing and Washington: \u201cAs two distinctive countries, our two sides may have different views or differences on some issues. This is only natural. The key is to properly handle and manage them.\u201d North Korean state media earlier rebuffed Trump\u2019s diplomatic overtures. The official news agency, KCNA, called Trump a \u201clunatic old man\u201d and said the US should oust him in order to escape \u201cthe abyss of doom\u201d. In a statement to journalists in Beijing, Trump said: \u201cAll responsible nations must join together to stop arming and financing \u2013 and even trading with \u2013 the murderous North Korean regime. \u201cTogether, we have in our power to finally liberate this region and the world from this very serious nuclear menace. But it will require collective action, collective strength, and collective devotion to winning the peace.\u201d Additional reporting by Benjamin Haas",
