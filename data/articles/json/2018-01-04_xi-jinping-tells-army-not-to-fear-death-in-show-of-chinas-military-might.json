    "content": "Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his status as China\u2019s most dominant leader since Chairman Mao with another tub-thumping display of military brawn involving thousands of heavily armed troops. Speaking at a military assembly in the northern province of Hebei, Xi told about 7,000 service men and women they should fear \u201cneither hardship nor death\u201d as they implemented the Communist party\u2019s orders. The military should \u201ccreate an elite and powerful force that is always ready for the fight, capable of combat and sure to win in order to fulfill the tasks bestowed by the Party and the people in the new era,\u201d added Xi, who was recently anointed one of modern China\u2019s most powerful rulers. \u201cAs Xi Jinping announced his instructions, there was prolonged and thunderous applause,\u201d the party\u2019s official newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, reported in a front-page story, alongside a photograph showing Xi clad in combat fatigues and black leather gloves. The newspaper claimed troops had gathered in 4,000 separate locations across China to hear their commander-in-chief\u2019s decree. Turning to the scarlet flag of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), they vowed to \u201cresolutely obey Chairman Xi\u2019s order\u201d. The Global Times, a nationalist, party-run tabloid, called Wednesday morning\u2019s mobilisation \u2013 the latest in a series of high-profile military reviews in mainland China and Hong Kong \u2013 a \u201clandmark\u201d event. \u201cThis is the first time since the founding of the country that instructions on military training have been directly issued by the chairman of the CMC [Central Military Commission], and it shows that improving combat readiness is now a strategic mission for the Chinese military,\u201d Xu Guangyu, a retired major general, told the newspaper. The event comes amid rumbling fears of a potential conflagration over the border in North Korea. On Wednesday US president Donald Trump used Twitter to taunt the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and his \u201cdepleted and food-starved regime\u201d. \u201cI too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d Trump wrote.
