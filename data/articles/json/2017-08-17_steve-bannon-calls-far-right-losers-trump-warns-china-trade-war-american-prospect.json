    "content": "White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has given an unusual interview in which he claimed there was no military solution for North Korea, the far right was a \u201ccollection of clowns\u201d and the left\u2019s focus on racism would allow him to \u201ccrush the Democrats\u201d. Bannon, who has been called the mastermind behind Donald Trump\u2019s nationalist agenda, made the controversial and unsolicited remarks to Robert Kuttner, co-founder and co-editor of the American Prospect, a leftwing political magazine, in an interview published Wednesday. The seemingly candid comments \u2013 which included the claims that he would oust his rivals in the federal government, who were \u201cwetting themselves\u201d \u2013 come at a time when Bannon faces an uncertain future at the White House. There have been increasing calls from the left and the right for the removal of the former editor of Breitbart News. When Trump was asked at a press conference this week if the chief strategist would remain in his position, the president said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d It is unclear why Bannon chose to call Kuttner, who wrote that he had not requested the interview and was \u201cstunned\u201d to hear from him. However after publication stories circulated that Bannon was unaware he was providing an interview. There have been recent reports of internal conflicts and power struggles within the administration, and Bannon made the call amid an intense backlash related to Trump\u2019s links to the far right and the president\u2019s comments that there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d at a violent white nationalist protest in Charlottesville. In the American Prospect story, headlined \u201cSteve Bannon, unrepentant\u201d, Trump\u2019s top aide said: \u201cWe\u2019re at economic war with China. It\u2019s in all their literature. They\u2019re not shy about saying what they\u2019re doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it\u2019s gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they\u2019re just tapping us along. It\u2019s just a sideshow.\u201d Contradicting Trump\u2019s threats of \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea, Bannon said: \u201cThere\u2019s no military solution [to North Korea\u2019s nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don\u2019t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, there\u2019s no military solution here, they got us.\u201d Bannon also discussed his \u201cbattle inside the administration to take a harder line on China trade\u201d, Kuttner wrote. Asked about his adversaries at the US departments of state and defense, Bannon responded, \u201cOh, they\u2019re wetting themselves.\u201d He continued: \u201cI\u2019m changing out people at east Asian defense; I\u2019m getting hawks in. I\u2019m getting Susan Thornton [acting head of east Asian and Pacific affairs] out at state.\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday night. The State Department said Thursday that Thornton remains in her position and that the secretary \u201ccontinues to rely on her to lead the State Department\u2019s diplomacy in Asia\u201d. Kuttner also asked Bannon about the \u201cugly white nationalism epitomized by the racist violence in Charlottesville and Trump\u2019s reluctance to condemn it\u201d. Heather Heyer, a civil rights activist, was killed when a man alleged to be a white nationalist drove a car into a crowd of counter protesters on Saturday. Bannon dismissed the far right as \u201cirrelevant\u201d, Kuttner wrote, quoting the Trump aide as saying: \u201cEthno-nationalism \u2013 it\u2019s losers. It\u2019s a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more \u2026 These guys are a collection of clowns.\u201d Regarding the Democrats, Bannon said: \u201cThe longer they talk about identity politics, I got \u2019em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\u201d Kuttner wrote that he had never spoken to Bannon before and that the question of whether the call was on or off the record never came up. Anthony Scaramucci, Trump\u2019s short-lived communications director, was recently fired after he called up a reporter and launched a foul-mouthed rant against senior colleagues, including Bannon. Bannon has attracted significant controversy during his time at the White House, where he was blamed for the failed implementation of the travel ban, which was quickly blocked by the courts. It has been reported that the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have long urged Bannon\u2019s dismissal. The president tried to downplay Bannon\u2019s influence on his campaign at the recent press conference, saying, \u201cI like Mr Bannon. He\u2019s a friend of mine. But Mr Bannon came on very late.\u201d",
