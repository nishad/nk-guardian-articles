    "content": "North Korea has renewed its threat to conduct a nuclear test amid heightened concern that the state may be on the path to building a nuclear arsenal. The repressive regime's official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said the country was justified in using all available means to protect itself from challenges by the United States and South Korea. North Korea would take \"counter-measures including nuclear test to protect the sovereignty and dignity,\" the newspaper said in a commentary carried by the official KCNA news agency. The threat comes days after statements by South Korea's defence minister that preparations for a new test appear to be near completion, although analysis by an American thinktank last week suggested a test may not be imminent. North Korea had stepped up the threat in March to show off its military strength after the UN security council condemned Pyongyang's launch of mid-range missiles into the sea. \"We would not rule out a new form of nuclear test for bolstering up our nuclear deterrence,\" it said in March. North Korea is heavily sanctioned by UN resolutions but has defied pressure to abandon its missile and nuclear programmes. It last conducted a nuclear test in February last year. The impoverished state, under its young leader Kim Jong-un, has channelled resources into building a nuclear arsenal and is believed to be working to miniaturise a warhead to mount on its long-range missiles to try to strike the mainland US. But general consensus among experts and officials is that it is some time from perfecting the technology. North Korea has recently conducted engine tests for an intercontinental ballistic missile that could potentially deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States, according to a US thinktank.",
