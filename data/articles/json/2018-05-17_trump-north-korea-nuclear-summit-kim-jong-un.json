    "content": "Donald Trump is still ready to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, at a summit next month, despite a statement from Pyongyang that it was not interested in discussing \u201cone-sided\u201d demands that it give up its nuclear weapons, the White House said on Wednesday. Asked whether the summit, planned for 12 June in Singapore, was still on, Trump told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d He added that \u201cwe haven\u2019t been notified at all\u201d that the North Koreans had cancelled the meeting. The president said he would insist on \u201cdenuclearisation\u201d at a summit with Kim. However, the word is ambiguous. North Korea uses it to describe a long-term process in which all nuclear weapons powers would eventually disarm, while Trump administration officials have interpreted it as the dismantling and eradication of the North Korean nuclear weapons and long-range missile programmes. That ambiguity, which allowed plans to go forward for the first ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, appeared to have been punctured over the weekend when John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, went on the Sunday talkshows to give their quite different versions of the US negotiating position. Bolton and Pompeo claimed that Trump\u2019s policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d had forced Kim to the negotiating table. Bolton, however, went further than Pompeo in defining denuclearisation. He said it meant \u201cgetting rid of all the nuclear weapons, dismantling them, taking them to Oakridge, Tennessee. It means getting rid of the uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing capabilities.\u201d His comments followed an earlier remark that the administration, in disarming North Korea, would adopt the Libya model, referring to Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s surrender of his embryonic nuclear weapons programme in 2003. North Korean officials have repeatedly pointed to Gaddafi\u2019s grisly death in a Nato-backed insurgency eight years later as a reason not to give up the country\u2019s nuclear weapons. Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea\u2019s first deputy minister of foreign affairs, rejected that position on Wednesday, singling out Bolton and his comments. Kim said: \u201cThis is not an expression of intention to address the issue through dialogue. It is essentially a manifestation of awfully sinister move to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq which had been collapsed due to yielding the whole of their countries to big powers.\u201d He concluded his statement by saying: \u201cIf the US is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the DPRK-US summit.\u201d Responding to the North Korean statement, Bolton told Fox News Radio Wednesday that \u201cwe are trying to be both optimistic and realistic at the same time\u201d. He said that the personal attack on him raised the question of \u201cwhether this really is a sign that that they\u2019re not taking our objective of denuclearization seriously.\u201d The White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, claimed the Trump administration had \u201cfully expected\u201d North Korea\u2019s posturing, and left the door open to the summit going ahead. \u201cIf they want to meet, we\u2019ll be ready and if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s OK too,\u201d Sanders said. She distanced Trump from Bolton\u2019s comments on the \u201cLibya model\u201d. She said she had not \u201cseen that as part of any discussions so I\u2019m not aware that that\u2019s a model that we\u2019re using\u201d. She added: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that that\u2019s a specific thing. I know that that comment was made. There\u2019s not a cookie-cutter model on how this would work. This is the President Trump model. He\u2019s going to run this the way he sees fit. We\u2019re 100% confident, as we\u2019ve said many times before, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware, he\u2019s the best negotiator and we\u2019re very confident on that front.\u201d North Korea had earlier called the Singapore summit into question over joint exercises by US and South Korean forces which Pyongyang said involved B-52 and F-22 warplanes, both capable of carrying nuclear bombs. It argued it represented a hostile gesture that violated an April agreement between the leaders of North and South Korea. The Pentagon said on Wednesday that there were never plans to include B-52 bombers in the Max Thunder war games. F-22 fighters have already taken part.",
