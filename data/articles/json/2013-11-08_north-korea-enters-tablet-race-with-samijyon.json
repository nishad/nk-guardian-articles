    "content": "Want to feel like one of the 1% \u2013 or at least, North Korea's 1%? Then head over to eBay and bid on one of the home-produced, Android-based tablets preloaded with the complete works of Kim Il Sung and a local version of Angry Birds that is causing a stir among North Korea watchers. The Samjiyon tablet is being increasingly spotted in shops and in use by locals. The established SA 70 version has a 4GB hard drive, 1GB RAM, a 7in screen and a 2-megapixel camera, with a variation including an analogue TV tuner to pick up local TV transmissions. Now a source has popped up on eBay, where bids currently stand at just over $102. Inside North Korea, the price \u201chas been coming down steadily\u201d since first coming to attention in May to around $150 for both foreigners and locals, said a frequent visitor and North Korea observer. This would appear to be way beyond the means of North Koreans according to official gauges of income, but actual wages are much higher, particularly so in the capital Pyongyang, where mobile phones are also very much part of the norm. There, tablets are becoming more common but are not as ubiquitous as mobiles. The tablet is \u201cnot a toy for the elite, but not as common as a pair of shoes,\u201d as one observer put it. The tablet's name is carefully chosen: Samijyon is the site of a famous 1939 battle with the Japanese. (North Korea won.) While the software is of North Korean origin, the news website North Korea Watch theorises that the tablets are assembled by Pyongyang\u2019s Korea Computer Center from parts supplied by Hong Kong\u2013based Shenzhen Yecon. It\u2019s not known if there are plans to export the tablets \u2013 though you can bid for one on eBay \u2013 but a major advantage of using it in-country is, as noted by Professor Frank Reudiger on 38 North, another North Korea-watching site, \u201cthe user is not harassed by advertisements or in-game shopping.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 November 2013. Samjiyon was misspelled in the headline and picture caption in an earlier version.",
