    "content": "One function of Donald Trump\u2019s swagger is to give cover to his retreats. It is not the US president\u2019s style to admit that he compromises. He professes a zero-sum world view, where concession is weakness. Yet, in relations with North Korea, Mr Trump has promised the country\u2019s dictatorial leader, Kim Jong-un, a gift \u2013 the status boost of a summit meeting \u2013 while receiving nothing in return. The seriousness of White House intent regarding the encounter was confirmed this week by news that Mike Pompeo, the current CIA director and Mr Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, held secret face-to-face talks with Mr Kim over Easter. That is the highest-level bilateral contact since Madeleine Albright, Bill Clinton\u2019s secretary of state, travelled to Pyongyang in 2000. Mr Pompeo\u2019s trip anticipates a much-hyped summit on 27 April between North and South Korean leaders. The choreography around that event has raised expectations that a formal peace might be declared, upgrading the armistice that froze \u2013 but never officially ended \u2013 war on the peninsula in 1953. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has attributed some of the momentum behind talks to Mr Trump\u2019s bellicose tone, stroking the US president\u2019s ego in an attempt to curb his most ferocious instincts. It is certainly true that the current flurry of engagement follows a period of frenzied escalation, as the US president looked ready for nuclear confrontation. That sequence doesn\u2019t prove that a deal, let alone a good one, is more available now than in the past. North Korea has long wanted to be treated as a peer of the US. Mr Kim is getting that treatment without taking a step closer to dismantling his nuclear capabilities \u2013 the primary US demand. North Korea can also deduce from the company Mr Trump keeps that forced regime change in Pyongyang is not far from the president\u2019s mind, or his ear. His national security adviser, John Bolton, is an ultra-hawk. He has urged abandonment of the Iran nuclear containment deal struck by Barack Obama\u2019s administration. If the White House won\u2019t make an existing non-proliferation pact work with Tehran there is little prospect of it showing the patience to craft a new one for North Korea \u2013 let alone stick to it. Mr Kim sees nuclear weapons as his insurance policy against US intervention. Mr Trump\u2019s incoherent combination of wildly aggressive rhetoric and diplomatic concession only confirms that view. It is also plausible that Washington hawks do not seriously expect progress and are itching to declare that dialogue has failed and war is a logical next resort. It is, of course, better that the two sides talk peace than threaten war. But it would be a mistake to imagine that a schedule of talks proves wisdom in the White House or assures progress. It is unclear what the US is getting out of this process and unclear whether, beyond relishing the drama, Mr Trump even knows what he wants. This does not look like a sure path towards a safer Korean peninsula.",
