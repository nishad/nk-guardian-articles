    "content": "Donald Trump on Saturday said his summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore would be a \u201cone-time shot\u201d. Speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in La Malbaie, Canada, the US president projected confidence over the prospects for a deal on denuclearization, stating: \u201cI think within the first minute, I\u2019ll know.\u201d \u201cJust my touch, my feel, that\u2019s what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long will it take to figure out if they\u2019re serious? You know, the way they say you know if you\u2019re going to like somebody in the first five seconds, you ever hear that one? I think very quickly I\u2019ll know whether or not something good is going to happen.\u201d Trump spoke as he prepared to depart for Singapore and the first meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president. The two leaders\u2019 relationship began with a long period of mutual threats and abuse but a surprise and rapid diplomatic thaw has endured despite Trump\u2019s abrupt cancellation of the summit late last month. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not been done before at this level,\u201d Trump said of attempts to establish peace with a reclusive, authoritarian and nuclear-armed regime. He added: \u201cThis is a leader that\u2019s really an unknown personality, people don\u2019t know much about him. I think that he\u2019s going to surprise on the upside, very much on the upside, we\u2019ll see.\u201d The Trump administration has said it wants a \u201cpermanent, verifiable, irreversible\u201d dismantling of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program and a peace treaty to formally end the Korean war, which ceased only with an armistice in 1953. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-time shot and I think it\u2019s going to work out very well,\u201d Trump said, though he also indicated that the summit may only be a starting point, saying it \u201cmay not work out. There\u2019s a good chance it won\u2019t work out. There\u2019s probably an even better chance that it will take a period of time, it\u2019ll be a process.\u201d The president also downplayed suggestions he was not well prepared, a notion he appeared to reinforce earlier this week when he said his approach to the meeting was not about preparation but \u201cabout attitude\u201d. Those comments sparked concerns among national security experts that the North Korean leader could outfox his opposite number. \u201cSo we\u2019re going in with a very positive spirit, very well prepared, I think,\u201d Trump said, before misidentifying the site of the meeting. \u201cAnd by the way, we have worked very well with their people, they have many people now in Shanghai, our people have been \u2013 in Singapore \u2013 our people have been working very, very well with the representatives of North Korea and I think we\u2019re going to come out fine.\u201d Asked about suggestions that even granting a meeting to Kim meant conceding valuable ground, he said: \u201cOnly the fake news says that. We just got three hostages back, we paid nothing \u2026 we have gotten \u2026 we haven\u2019t done anything. The haters, they say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re giving him a meeting\u2019 \u2013 gimme a break, OK?\u201d Trump also made lengthy complaints about other countries\u2019 trade policies and doubled down on his claim that Russia should be reinstated to the G7, having been suspended in 2014 after its annexation of Crimea. Trump\u2019s statement on Friday that the Putin regime should be readmitted sparked bipartisan scorn and rebuke from key US allies. \u201cI think it would be an asset to have Russia back in,\u201d Trump told reporters on Saturday. \u201cI think it would be good for the world, I think it would be good for Russia, I think it would be good for the United States, I think it would be good for all of the countries in the G7.\u201d Trump blamed Barack Obama for not doing enough to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine, stating: \u201cObama can say all he wants but he allowed Russia to take Crimea. I may have had a much different attitude.\u201d Obama condemned Russia\u2019s actions and pursued sanctions against Moscow. Trump also pushed back at suggestions that under his leadership, amid disputes regarding relations with Russia and international trade, the US was becoming isolated from its traditional allies. \u201cI would say the level of relationship is a 10,\u201d he said, claiming \u201cwe have a great relationship\u201d with the leaders of countries including Germany, France and Canada. After a prompt from his economic adviser Larry Kudlow, the US president then left the summit.",
