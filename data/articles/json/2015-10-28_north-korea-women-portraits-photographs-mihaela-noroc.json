    "content": "Over the last two years, 30-year-old Romanian photographer Mihaela Noroc has travelled the world with a backpack and camera shooting portraits of women. So far she\u2019s visited 45 countries for The Atlas of Beauty, a project she hopes will offer insight into how social, cultural and political values shape and define women\u2019s roles and femininity. Noroc\u2019s latest journey took her to North Korea, where she was able to take almost 30 portraits. Her images hint at the reality of everyday life for women in the secretive state. \u201cWhen you hear things about North Korea it is always political,\u201d Noroc explains. \u201cBut my idea was to show another side, to show regular people.\u201d Noroc entered the country via Sinuiju, on the border with China, on a trip organised by Young Pioneer Tours, a company offering visits for foreigners on a tight budget. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice big differences between the people living in the capital and people in other cities \u2013 but of course in Pyongyang, with its large boulevards, there were more people, and so I discovered many more interesting faces.\u201d Noroc explains: \u201cI approached women in the street, accompanied by my two female guides, who helped me explain my project \u2013 this was the routine for most of the portraits. \u201cIn most countries I\u2019ve observed that women smile in front of the camera and that tended to be the case when I shot women in North Korea \u2013 but I here I tried to find something more profound, to get them to open up and reveal something more authentic, to see a story in their eyes.\u201d Though women in North Korea might be unfamiliar with global fashion and beauty because of the regime\u2019s tight control on the flow of information, Noroc noted that this doesn\u2019t mean they are not concerned with their appearance: high heels and conservative outfits \u2013 accessorised with a pin of the chest of their country\u2019s leader \u2013 are common. \u201cWomen [in the DPRK] are definitely more concerned about their looks. \u201cOf course, you could say that is the case in many countries, but in North Korea I felt the gap was much wider in how men and women relate to their physical appearance.\u201d Access to the internet or foreign television is almost nonexistent in the country \u2013 so entertainment must take different forms. Noroc noted that people loved to sing and dance, with concerts in public squares and mass dances for celebrations. The Moranbong Band, an all-female music group whose members were selected by the country\u2019s supreme leader Kim Jong-un, are \u201chugely popular, a phenomenon,\u201d the photographer says. \u201cYou hear their songs everywhere and everyone knows their lyrics \u2013 this singer [pictured below] also sang some of their songs. I also saw a military marching band performing one of their songs.\u201d Noroc was in the country for nine days, and was accompanied by guides most of the time \u2013 \u201cbut not on trains or inside hotels. \u201cI did see other tourists, not many, but since you visit the same places and sleep at the same hotels, you inevitably do see some. My tour was different in that I was able to walk in the streets a lot, and meet many regular North Korean people.\u201d Uniforms are also a very common sight on both men and women. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s army is huge, so it\u2019s common to see military workers on the streets. Soldiers are sometimes involved in other activities such as construction work, for example, so they\u2019re really everywhere.\u201d \u201cEverybody was telling us that in North Korea they have a saying: \u2018North Korea has the most beautiful women in the peninsula, while South Korea [has] the most beautiful men\u2019.\u201d Despite the unusual nature of Noroc\u2019s project \u2013 and the restrictions placed on North Korean citizens \u2013 the photographer found that women were remarkably willing to take part and seemed happy to have their picture taken. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for them to have their picture taken by foreigners. They were really excited when I was showing them the photos on the screen of my camera.\u201d Noroc is currently travelling in Nepal for her next series of photographs.
