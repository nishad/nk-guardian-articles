    "content": "Name: Air Koryo. Age: Pensionable \u2013 the airline is 65 years old this year. Appearance: Ghastly, with most of its rather small roster of aircraft purchased from the Soviet Union after the end of the cold war. Ooh, an aeroplane? Because I am thinking of going on holiday, as it happens. How lovely. Where to? The party island of Ibiza? The celebrated seafood trail of the Scottish lochs? The Maldives, while some of its islands are still above water? No, I\u2019ve decided to swim against the tide and head for North Korea. Right. That whole tense entente-cordiale-of-sorts-with-neighbouring-South-Korea thing not dissuading you, then? No, if anything the ever-present threat of war with them, and, indeed, pretty much everyone else on the planet, adds to the frisson. And you are not put off by the fact that wearing jeans is illegal and you\u2019re not allowed to talk to the locals? I will wear sensible slacks and maintain an air of unapproachable froideur. OK, well, if the need for comfortable trousers and lack of human interaction is not enough to put you off, maybe you ought to consider the fact that you\u2019ll have to travel with Air Koryo, North Korea\u2019s state airline. Sounds lovely. Does Kim Jong-un do the flight-safety video? That might not make a whole heap of difference. Air Koryo has been named as the worst airline on the planet for the fourth year running. Indeed, it is the only airline on said planet to be given just one star by the Skytrax rating system. Oh. And that\u2019s out of how many airlines? 197. Oh dear. Well \u2013 ha ha! - it can\u2019t possibly be worse than \u2026 Ryanair? You couldn\u2019t be more wrong. The much-maligned Irish chaps were one of 22 airlines to be awarded two stars, which means that Air Koryo is precisely half as good as Ryanair. Blimey. And all because the planes are a bit long in the tooth? Nope, the Skytrax report also cites \u201cquestionable\u201d safety and rudimentary safety belts, which is why pretty much all of Air Koryo\u2019s planes are banned in the European Union because they\u2019re a horrendous risk. Ah well, Ibiza it is then. Do say: \u201cI seem to have left my boarding pass in my illegal jeans.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cHey, look! Asiana Airlines in South Korea got five stars from Skytrax! Go South Korea!\u201d",
