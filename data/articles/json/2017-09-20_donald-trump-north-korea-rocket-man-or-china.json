    "content": "On the face of it, Donald Trump\u2019s threat to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea was aimed squarely at Kim Jong-un and the twisted and reckless \u201cband of criminals\u201d he said surrounded him. \u201cRocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime,\u201d the US president warned during his bellicose debut at the UN general assembly. But was the North Korean dictator Trump\u2019s true target, or was it really the man next door? Some experts suspect Trump\u2019s incendiary ultimatum was in fact directed at Chinese president Xi Jinping, whose assistance he is seeking in the crusade against what he dubbed Kim\u2019s \u201cdepraved regime\u201d. Bonnie Glaser, director of the China power project at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said: \u201cThe way Trump speaks about North Korea \u2026 suggests he believes that if he is very, very tough that he can somehow persuade other countries to do more against North Korea: that he can bully them into doing more.\u201d In the case of China, that meant convincing Xi to cut off North Korea\u2019s crude oil supply, a game-changing move that could, eventually, topple Kim\u2019s regime. Glaser said it was hard to know how such threats might affect Beijing\u2019s calculus. But the message to Xi was clear: \u201cIf you guys don\u2019t do more and you really don\u2019t curb your oil exports, then we are going to strike.\u201d Chinese commentators are split on whether Trump\u2019s gambit will pay off. Shi Yinhong, an international relations expert at Beijing\u2019s Renmin University, said the president\u2019s \u201cwild words\u201d were doomed to fail. \u201cHe wants to intimidate North Korea and to pressure China. He wants to show that he is a man and that everybody should be afraid of him. But over the past few months it has become so clear that Kim Jong-un is not afraid of him. On the contrary, the military threat will make Kim even more focused on nuclear and missile development to protect North Korea\u2019s survival in the face of this kind of American policy.\u201d Nor was China likely to change its position. Shi said Beijing simply did not believe Trump would risk a military attack on its doorstep, a move experts universally agree would spark a catastrophic conflagration on the Korean peninsula. \u201cThey are not going to totally destroy North Korea and risk retaliation with nuclear weapons. He\u2019s only bluffing.\u201d An editorial in the China Daily took a similarly dim view of what it called Trump\u2019s indulgent and antagonistic finger-pointing at the UN: \u201cHis threat to \u2018totally destroy\u2019 [North Korea will] ... likely worsen the already volatile situation,\u201d it said. But Shen Dingli, a foreign affairs expert from Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, offered a more sympathetic take on Trump\u2019s apparent strategy and said he could see some art in the deal the president was trying to broker. Shen said Trump\u2019s \u201cconfrontational words\u201d were not only being lapped up by the American public but were also starting to affect Beijing\u2019s thinking. \u201cEach time he has threatened China, China has made concessions because China wants to protect its trade with the US,\u201d he said, pointing to China\u2019s recent support for two rounds of UN security council sanctions against North Korea. Shen said China did not need to completely capitulate, merely to continue making incremental concessions that would keep the US president at bay and avert a major falling-out between the world\u2019s top two economies. \u201cTrump is a businessman by training. He wants to raise the bar higher to get a good return. [But] he never expects a partner to pay the full cost,\u201d Shen said. Evidence to support Shen\u2019s theory can be found on page 45 of Trump\u2019s 1987 bestseller The Art of the Deal: \u201cMy style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I\u2019m after,\u201d he writes, adding: \u201cSometimes I settle for less than I sought, but in most cases I still end up with what I want.\u201d Such is Trump\u2019s apparent obsession with getting China to help him rein in North Korea, that even his new nickname for Kim Jong-un \u2013 \u201crocket man\u201d \u2013 has reportedly been chosen with Beijing in mind. \u201cIt translates clearly into Chinese,\u201d one senior administration official told CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta after Trump gave the moniker its latest airing at the UN\u2019s headquarters in New York. The nickname \u2013 which translates into \u201chuojian ren\u201d in Mandarin \u2013 appeared to have struck a chord on Chinese social media sites, although perhaps not in the way Trump had intended. \u201cSuch a cool name: \u2018Rocket Man\u2019,\u201d one user of Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter, wrote on Wednesday. \u201cIt makes Fatty Kim seem like a super hero.\u201d Glaser said Beijing\u2019s ears would also have pricked up at Trump\u2019s attack on countries that had \u201cfaithfully implemented socialism\u201d. \u201cFrom the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems,\u201d he told the UN. Those comments would fuel Chinese suspicions and anxieties that, despite reassurances from US secretary of state Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s administration was indeed set on regime change in places such as North Korea, Glaser said. \u201cI think they will conclude that president Trump can potentially do something dangerous and that they have to be careful \u2026 I don\u2019t think they rule out the possibility that he could actually launch a military strike.\u201d That, of course, may be precisely the point.
