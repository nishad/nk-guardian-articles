    "content": "There were no questions and no cameras allowed at the packed Hollywood premiere of The Interview on Thursday night. The film, financed by the $8bn tinseltown powerhouse Sony Pictures, features Seth Rogen and James Franco as celebrity reporters tasked by the CIA with assassinating North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The movie had already been declared \u201can act of war\u201d by regime officials in June but that turned out to be only the beginning of Sony Picture\u2019s problems; the studio\u2019s internal debate about how to edit the movie was revealed in one of many corporate emails hacked and leaked on the internet in one of the largest releases of confidential data in recent history. Just days before the premiere it was revealed by Bloomberg news that the chief executive of its parent company, Japan\u2019s Sony Corporation\u2019s Kazuo Hirai, had personally intervened in the edit. Hirai was dissatisfied with Kim\u2019s death scene and left it to Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal to deliver the news to Rogen, the film\u2019s director. After the boss\u2019s intervention, she emailed him in August requesting a shot which used \u201cno face melting, less fire in the hair, fewer embers on the face\u201d to replace the current version of Kim\u2019s death, which culminates in his head exploding. Rogen was not impressed. \u201cThis is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy,\u201d he wrote back. But eventually, in October, he capitulated and cut, amongst other things, \u201cthe entire secondary wave of head chunks\u201d. Little did any of the executives know at the time, but the decision to commission a film portraying the slapstick death of a dictator could have been responsible for one of the largest-ever hacks of confidential data. On 24 November a group by the name of Guardians of Peace announced it had infiltrated the studio\u2019s computer systems and reportedly taken more than 100 terabytes of files. Unreleased movies, thousands of employees social security numbers, executive pay packages and internal emails \u2013 including those on the portrayal of Kim\u2019s melting face \u2013 began appearing in vast data dumps uploaded to the internet. Investigators working for Sony have described it as an \u201cunparalleled crime\u201d that is \u201cunprecedented in nature\u201d. Sony Pictures is now fighting on all fronts: to protect its public image, repair relationships with the Hollywood stars exposed in the hack, and to examine the potential legals pitfalls such a breach could result in. The North Korean government has distanced itself from the hack, but acknowledged it \u201cmight be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathisers\u201d. An FBI investigation is ongoing, but a senior FBI official said on Wednesday that no links between Pynongyang and the hack had been estalished. Irrespective of who is responsible, the steady stream of stories has driven the entertainment news agenda for the past fortnight. \u201cIt\u2019s a gigantic story, the most significant in the industry, certainly this year maybe in the past few years,\u201d said Matthew Belloni, executive editor of the Hollywood Reporter, who is leading the organisation\u2019s exhaustive coverage of the scandal. \u201cEverything is on the table now, the studio has basically become fully transparent and that\u2019s never happened before.\u201d Of the most salacious this week, a chain of correspondence between Pascal and veteran producer Scott Rudin revealed the intense struggle to get a biopic of Steve Jobs into production. One expletive-filled exchange concerned Angelina Jolie, who was attempting to poach David Fincher \u2013 mooted as the director of the Jobs film \u2013 for a project of her own. Rudin described the star as \u201ca minimally talented spoiled brat\u201d in possession of a \u201crampaging ego\u201d. But such glimpses into the movie world failed to startle many Hollywood insiders. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unduly shocking about it. It just shows that Hollywood is a hotbed of gossip, spite, malice \u2013 all the good stuff, you know?\u201d acclaimed film critic and historian David Thomson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s rather more entertaining than a lot of the films Sony put out; I could have taken more of it,\u201d he added. Some Sony personnel may well agree with one part of that assessment at least, as hacked employee feedback documents reported by Gawker last week showed some believe the studio had stopped taking creative risks. Said one: \u201cWe continue to be saddled with mundane, formulaic Adam Sandler films.\u201d Other recent revelations includes the alter egos of Hollywood stars, an unreleased script by the creator of Breaking Bad, Vince Gilligan, and the pay disparity between Franco and Rogen for The Interview. Away from the theatrics and bitchiness, some documents have shone a light on the inherent bias and perceived prejudice of the Hollywood machine. It was shown that of Sony\u2019s 17 executives earning over a million dollars a year, just one of them, Pascal, is a woman. This week, further correspondence between Pascal and Rudin revealed racially insensitive remarks about Barack Obama when the two joked that the president would prefer to watch films about African Americans. \u201cShould I ask him if he liked Django?\u201d Pascal wrote. Both have issued statements apologising for the remarks, but civil rights leader Rev Al Sharpton has labelled the remarks as a reflection of \u201ca continued lack of diversity in positions of power in major Hollywood studios\u201d. For business insiders arguably the most interesting documents are those revealing the so-called \u201cUltimates\u201d, the long-term profitability of Sony\u2019s catalogue, which are kept a closely guarded secret. Entertainment lawyers plan to examine these documents, along with others, to check they match with profitability statements given to actors and producers for residuals, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Lawyers have also warned that the thousands of Sony employees and stars, whose personal details were exposed in the breach, could have grounds to mount a class action under data protection laws. Media organisations\u2019 decision to report on the content of the criminal breach has drawn criticism from some of Hollywood\u2019s elite. Director Judd Apatow, whose personal data was among the thousands released, compared reporting the documents as akin to writing about the hacked nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence in August. \u201cWhy are they ok to print?\u201d he tweeted. Belloni said it was unclear how much longer the leaks would continue to come, but that there was more news from those documents already uploaded. He added, however, that there existed a \u201cgrey line\u201d on which documents the Hollywood Reporter would report. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to state our official policy because I believe this is a fluid situation, and media doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum.\u201d Hours before Thursday\u2019s premiere Pascal gave an interview to the film websitedeadline.com, pledging that Sony to strengthen Sony\u2019s defences against hacking. Asked if she had considered not releasing The Interview, the reply was strident: \u201cNo one will tell us what movies to release, ever. Nobody should be able to intimidate a company to not to do its business.\u201d",
