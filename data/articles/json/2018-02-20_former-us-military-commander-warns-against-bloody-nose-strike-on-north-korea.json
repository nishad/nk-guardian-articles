    "content": "A senior former US military commander and intelligence chief has warned against a pre-emptive \u201cbloody nose\u201d strike on North Korea. Retired Admiral Dennis Blair said Washington needed to be ready to respond militarily if North Korea attacked the US or its allies in the region \u2013 \u201cbut not a first strike; it\u2019s just high risk and unpredictable\u201d. The former director of national intelligence warned about the difficulty of destroying North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons, amid reports a targeted strike has been canvassed by the Trump administration. \u201cWith all the tunnels they have, with all of the difficulties of intelligence in that country, I don\u2019t think an American-South Korean strike [on the North] would have a high probability of taking out all of their nuclear capability and then you\u2019ve left them with not only with nuclear capability but also an aggrieved sense of it,\u201d said Blair, who held the intelligence post from early 2009 to mid 2010. There were risks of escalation if Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime thought the country was about to be invaded, Blair told the Guardian. Any US-led action should be seen as a response to a North Korean provocation to avoid any misunderstanding. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s desire to be seen as unpredictable, Blair said: \u201cI think this business of treating unpredictability as a virtue in dealing with North Korea is a lot more dangerous than predictability. \u201cWe\u2019re much stronger,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to be consistent and powerful and persistent. I think that\u2019s a lot safer, so a lot of this talk about you know, sneak up on them and give them a bloody nose, be unpredictable, I think is not correct for dealing with a country like North Korea.\u201d Speculation about such a strike grew last month when Georgetown University professor Victor Cha was dropped from consideration to be the US ambassador to South Korea. In an op-ed, Cha said some administration officials had suggested a preventive military strike aimed at showing American strength \u2013 but he had warned of the dangers of triggering a wider war. The administration denies the strategy. Blair\u2019s 34-year navy career included running US Pacific Command. He now chairs the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA and favours stepping up information campaigns into North Korea to counter the Kim regime\u2019s propaganda. The goal, he said, was to cut the connection between the supportive elites and the central dictatorship. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really tried hard enough with the most potent weapon we have and a lot lower risk than invading them or trying to bomb their nuclear program and that kind of thing,\u201d Blair said.",
