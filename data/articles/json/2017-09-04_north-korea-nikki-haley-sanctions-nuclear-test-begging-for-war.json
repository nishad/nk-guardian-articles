    "content": "America\u2019s top diplomat has warned that North Korea is \u201cbegging for war\u201d and urged the UN security council to impose the toughest sanctions possible on the isolated dictatorship. The blunt statement by Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, came as Donald Trump spoke with South Korean president Moon Jae-in and agreed that the North\u2019s latest nuclear test was an \u201cunprecedented\u201d provocation. North Korea carried out its sixth and by far most powerful nuclear test on Sunday. The underground blast triggered a magnitude 6.3 tremor and was more powerful than the bombs dropped by the US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the second world war. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Haley, noting that an approach of incremental sanctions since 2006 had not worked. \u201cThe time for half-measures in the security council is over. The time has come to exhaust all of our diplomatic means before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Nuclear powers understand their responsibilities, she added, and Kim Jong-un has shown no such understanding. \u201cHis abusive use of missiles and his nuclear threats show that he is begging for war. War is never something the United States wants. We don\u2019t want it now. But our country\u2019s patience is not unlimited. We will defend our allies and our territory.\u201d Haley said her country would circulate a resolution this week with the aim of getting it approved next Monday and, in a thinly veiled jab at China, said the US would target countries trading with Pyongyang, a prospect also raised by Trump on Sunday. \u201cThe United States will look at every country that does business with North Korea as a country, that is giving aid to their reckless and dangerous nuclear intentions,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d She added: \u201cOnly the strongest sanctions will enable us to resolve this problem through diplomacy. We have kicked the can down the road long enough. There is no more road left.\u201d Trump and Moon spoke for around 40 minutes by phone on Monday, according to South Korea\u2019s presidential office. Trump reaffirmed an \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to South Korea\u2019s defence, it said, and the two countries agreed to seek stronger UN sanctions against the North. The leaders also agreed to remove a limit on the payload of South Korean missiles in response to the North\u2019s nuclear test, which they saw as a grave provocation that was \u201cunprecedented\u201d. In the wake of the North Korean test on Sunday, Trump accused South Korea of \u201cappeasement\u201d, adding to tensions raised by his possible withdrawal from a free trade agreement with Seoul. The Kremlin said Moon had also spoken with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: \u201cIt is very easy to say the word \u2018war\u2019 for countries outside the region, but those in the region need to be smarter and more balanced.\u201d The US, UK, France, Japan and South Korea requested Monday\u2019s urgent UN security council meeting after North Korea detonated what it described as a hydrogen bomb designed for a long-range missile. North Korea also tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July that could fly about 6,200 miles, putting many parts of the US mainland within range and prompting Trump to threaten \u201cfire and fury\u201d in response. The security council has imposed seven sets of sanctions on North Korea since it first tested a nuclear device in 2006, but Pyongyang has repeatedly found ways to circumvent the measures. The most recent resolutions, however, have significantly toughened the sanctions, targeting key exports sectors such as coal that are a source of hard currency for Kim\u2019s regime. Addressing the council, Haley rejected as \u201cinsulting\u201d a Chinese proposal for a freeze on North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for a suspension of US-South Korean annual military drills. \u201cWhen a rogue regime has a nuclear weapon and an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] pointed at you, you do not take steps to lower your guard. No one would do that. We certainly won\u2019t.\u201d But Liu Jieyi, the Chinese ambassador to the UN, said: \u201cThe situation on the peninsula is deteriorating constantly as we speak, falling into a vicious circle. The peninsula issue must be resolved peacefully. China will never allow chaos and war on the peninsula.\u201d Russia backs China\u2019s proposal for a freeze on North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a suspension of US-South Korea military drills. Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters after Monday\u2019s meeting: \u201cResolutions aimed solely at sanctioning North Korea have not worked well before.\u201d Reuters reported that diplomats have said the security council could now consider banning North Korean textile exports and its national airline, stopping supplies of oil to the government and military, preventing North Koreans from working abroad and adding top officials to a blacklist to subject them to an asset freeze and travel ban. Matthew Rycroft, the UK ambassador to the UN, described the situation as \u201cdisturbing and unprecedented\u201d, but said it was \u201cclear\u201d sanctions applied by the Security Council on North Korea were \u201chaving an effect\u201d. He called on the security council to condemn the latest test, and said: \u201cWe continue to wish for a peaceful way forward: dialogue will always be our end goal but returning to dialogue without a serious sign of intent from Pyongyang would be a set up to failure. \u201cNorth Korea must change course to allow a return to dialogue. Were they to do so the opportunity exists to end this crisis. Until that moment we must stay the course on sanctions and continue, as the Secretary General has called for, to present a united front.\u201d French ambassador Francois Delattre said France was calling for the adoption of new UN sanctions, swift implementation of existing ones and new separate sanctions by the European Union. Japanese ambassador Koro Bessho told reporters ahead of the council meeting: \u201cWe cannot waste any more time. And in order to do that, we need North Korea to feel the pressure, but if they go down this road there will be consequences.\u201d South Korea\u2019s defence ministry warned on Monday that Pyongyang may be preparing another missile launch after two tests in July of ICBMs that apparently brought the US mainland into range. Jang Kyoung-soo, acting deputy minister of national defense policy, told a parliamentary hearing on Monday: \u201cWe have continued to see signs of possibly more ballistic missile launches. We also forecast North Korea could fire an intercontinental ballistic missile.\u201d South Korea said its air force and army conducted exercises involving long-range air-to-surface and ballistic missiles on Monday. In addition to the drill, South Korea will cooperate with the United States and seek to deploy \u201cstrategic assets like aircraft carriers and strategic bombers\u201d, Jang said. US defence Secretary James Mattis has warned of \u201ca massive military response\u201d to any threat from North Korea against the US or its allies.",
