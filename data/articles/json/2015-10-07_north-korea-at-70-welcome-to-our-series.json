    "content": "On Saturday North Korea is throwing a party. Floating video screens have been set up on the Taedong river near Kim Il-sung square in Pyongyang and final preparations are being made for grand military parades and elaborate fireworks displays. The day has been declared a national public holiday and state media have reported that all workers will be given an extra month\u2019s salary. The occasion is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Korean Workers\u2019 party, the backbone of the state. It\u2019s considered a hugely symbolic event and the anticipation is palpable. On the 65th anniversary Kim Jong-un made his first official appearance after being named his father\u2019s successor \u2013 and North Korea watchers are anticipating surprises this year. Show of strength There have been mounting concerns that the North Korea may use the occasion to boost national morale by launching a long-range missile or a fourth nuclear test. The country recently announced plans to restart a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and officials have boasted about being in the \u201cfinal phase\u201d of developing a new geo-stationary satellite. \u201cThe world will clearly see a series of satellites \u2026 soaring into the sky at the times and locations determined by the [Workers\u2019 party] central committee,\u201d the director of the National Aerospace Development Administration told official state media. To increase tensions even further, the North Korean ambassador to the UK warned last week that the DPRK would not hesitate to launch long-range nuclear missiles \u201cat any time and any place\u201d. Seasoned observers may dismiss this as standard rhetoric bearing little relation to reality, but international experts remain concerned. Inside North Korea In the run-up to the anniversary, the Guardian\u2019s North Korea network is publishing a three-day series exploring life in the world\u2019s most hard-to-know state. We aim to go beyond the nuclear threats and mass gymnastic displays to explore the changes taking place under Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership. Highlights include: A look inside Pyongyang\u2019s refurbished May Day stadium - and what it says about the young leader\u2019s ambitions to host the World Cup and Olympic Games. We hear from people who have lived in the capital to find out more about daily life among the elite, and analyse the impact of recent economic reforms. A panel of experts will discuss ways the world can engage with the pariah nation, and we\u2019ll ask whether tourism is a force for good or merely bolsters a repressive regime. We\u2019ll look at South Korea\u2019s plans for reunification on the peninsula, questioning just how feasible it is to reconcile two of the world\u2019s most incompatible nations. There will also be an extract from a dystopian novel set in a reunited Korea. We have lined up a student doctor who visited North Korea on a medical mission to answer your questions about the country\u2019s health system. We\u2019ll feature images from Pyongyang\u2019s first western art-photography exhibition and there will be a quiz to test your knowledge about what high-profile visitors from Dennis Rodman to Damon Albarn have said about the city. Tell us what you think This is just a taste of what\u2019s on offer, so follow the series on theguardian.com/north-korea-70. We also want to give you the opportunity to have your say. Have you been to North Korea? Do you agree with our expert panel? Do you think the Koreas will ever be reconciled? Please tell us what you think by commenting beneath the stories or on Twitter using the hashtag #GuardianNK70. If you have any suggestions for stories we\u2019d love to hear from you \u2013 either in the comments or by emailing maeve.shearlaw@theguardian.com",
