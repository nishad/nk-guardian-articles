    "content": "North Korea cast further doubt on a planned summit between its leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump, warning that Pyongyang could make the US \u201ctaste an appalling tragedy\u201d. The fate of the summit is \u201centirely\u201d up to the US, North Korea\u2019s vice foreign minister Choe Son-hui said in a statement on Thursday. If the talks are cancelled, Choe suggested the two countries could engage in a \u201cnuclear-to-nuclear showdown\u201d. \u201cWhether the US will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision \u2026 of the US,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will neither beg the US for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us.\u201d The comments come after Trump earlier this week said there was a \u201cvery substantial chance\u201d the summit could be delayed. They also follow a week of heated rhetoric in Washington, with some US officials threatening a fate similar to Libya if the North does not relinquish its nuclear weapons program. Libya dictator Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed in a Nato-backed uprising against his rule. \u201cIn view of the remarks of the US high-ranking politicians who have not yet woken up to this stark reality and compare the DPRK to Libya that met a tragic fate, I come to think that they know too little about us,\u201d Choe said, referring to the North\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. \u201cTo borrow their words, we can also make the US taste an appalling tragedy it has neither experienced nor even imagined up to now.\u201d In an interview on Fox News, US vice president Mike Pence said: \u201cThis will only end like the Libyan model ended if Kim Jong-un doesn\u2019t make a deal\u201d. That echoed earlier comments by national security advisor John Bolton that the US was studying Libya\u2019s unilateral disarmament as a blueprint for negotiations with Pyongyang. \u201cAs a person involved in the US affairs, I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the US vice-president,\u201d Choe said. She said Pence had made \u201cunbridled and impudent remarks that north Korea might end like Libya\u201d. Earlier on Wednesday, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo had said he was \u201cvery hopeful\u201d the summit would go ahead but it was \u201cultimately up to Chairman Kim.\u201d The comments come as North Korea prepares to close its only known nuclear test site, a symbolic gesture that ultimately will not affect the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal.",
