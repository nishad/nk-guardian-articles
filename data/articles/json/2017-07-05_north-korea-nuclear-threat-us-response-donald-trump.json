    "content": "Public urgency about the threat of North Korea developing a reliable long-range nuclear weapon capable of striking the US was sharpened by news of what Pyongyang and outside analysts say was a successful intercontinental ballistic missile test. Any immediate US response must take into account the ability of North Korea to instantly launch a devastating strike against allies in Japan and South Korea, including the almost 30,000 US troops stationed on the Korean peninsula, with chemical, biological or possibly nuclear weapons. Conflict with China lurks as an additional grave concern. What should or can the US do? Over the past two weeks, judging by his Twitter account, Donald Trump appears to have abandoned his original policy on North Korea, which was to rely on China to pressure its neighbor and trading partner to scrap its nuclear program. While some experts stated clearly months ago that Trump\u2019s policy would not work, other influential voices, such as an independent taskforce convened last year by the Council on Foreign Relations, strongly supported such a policy, urging US officials to \u201cundertake a major diplomatic effort to elevate the issue to the top of the US-China bilateral relationship\u201d. The options currently on the table for the US break down roughly into four categories: sanctions and embargoes; diplomacy and concessions; cyber sabotage; and other military options. Here is a summary of expert opinion and analysis on each. Sanctions and embargoes North Korea has been the target of various financial and trade sanctions, including sanctions targeting the country\u2019s key coal exports and an oil embargo, since it conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. After the death of American exchange student Otto Warmbier following his detention in North Korea last month, the US expanded its sanctions policy to include secondary sanctions on a Chinese bank and two Chinese individuals for providing North Korea with access to international markets. \u201cWe should be sending teams all over the world to shut down financial assets, enforce sanctions and interdict materials the regime uses for weapons,\u201d wrote Wendy R Sherman, the chief US negotiator in the Iran nuclear deal. \u201cWe should press the United Nations to do more.\u201d But North Korea\u2019s economy has not been crippled by sanctions, thanks in part to the continued trade with China. \u201cNorth Korea is far better off now than it was 11 years ago, and worlds apart from the famine of the 1990s,\u201d wrote Benjamin Silverstein in The Diplomat. \u201cFood insecurity prevails in North Korea but the country has not seen widespread starvation since the late 1990s.\u201d And \u201cif we were going to impose crippling sanctions\u201d Van Jackson, a defense expert at Victoria University, told the Asia New Zealand foundation, \u201cthe time to do it would have been well before it had nuclear-capable missiles, not after.\u201d Diplomacy and concessions \u201cNegotiate or else,\u201d Jim Walsh of the MIT security studies program advised in a piece last week published by Axios: During the nuclear age, dozens countries started down the path to nuclear weapons but reversed course. And there are cases where countries acquired or inherited nuclear weapons gave them up outright. Often, that happy result was accomplished not through war but diplomacy \u2013 agreements that stopped or rolled back a nuclear weapons program.\u201d \u201cOpening dialogue is neither a reward nor a concession to North Korea; it is simply the only realistic way to reduce the growing dangers,\u201d reads a new Guardian piece in support of negotiations: Technological solutions \u2013 disabling launches through electronic or cyber attacks, or intercepting missiles \u2013 will be at best only partially successful. Sanctions may be part of the answer, but history shows that they are not in themselves a solution. The administration has flirted repeatedly with military options, and there is a grave risk that its interest in them may revive, despite the immense dangers. The prospects of destroying the nuclear arsenal \u2013 still less conventional stockpiles \u2013 would be low, the prospects of devastating repercussions for Seoul high and the chances of a wider destabilisation of the region significant... However Jackson, the Victoria University analyst, doubts the efficacy of diplomacy. In Jackson\u2019s analysis, \u201cnothing much will change in the coming days and months unless 1) the US attacks; 2) the US imposes secondary sanctions on Chinese firms...; or 3) the US pivots its North Korea policy away from denuclearisation and figures out how to live with a nuclear-armed North Korea.\u201d Cyber warfare The US has been keeping up a secret program of cyber attacks and other nonconventional warfare against North Korea since 2014, David Sanger and William Broad first reported in the New York Times in March. \u201cAdvocates of the sophisticated effort to remotely manipulate data inside North Korea\u2019s missile systems argue the United States has no real alternative because the effort to stop the North from learning the secrets of making nuclear weapons has already failed,\u201d the journalists wrote. \u201cThe only hope now is stopping the country from developing an intercontinental missile, and demonstrating that destructive threat to the world.\u201d The problem with cyber attacks, electronic warfare and industrial sabotage, the authors noted, is that the arsenal \u201ccarries no guarantees\u201d of effective prevention, as the world saw on Tuesday. Military options In response to the North Korean provocation, US and Korean forces undertook a joint live-fire missile exercise on Wednesday. A joint statement afterwards warning of possible military action. \u201cSelf restraint, which is a choice, is all that separates armistice and war,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs this Alliance missile live fire shows, we are able to change our choice when so ordered by our Alliance national leaders. It would be a grave mistake for anyone to believe anything to the contrary.\u201d The military options on the table range from beefing up the South Korea-based THAAD (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense), a wider attack on North Korea or even an attempt to assassinate the North Korean leader. National security adviser HR McMaster appears to have moved in a matter of weeks toward military action. On 29 June, following the death of Warmbier and continued North Korean test activity, McMaster warned, \u201cThe threat is much more immediate now and so it\u2019s clear that we can\u2019t repeat the same approach \u2013 failed approach of the past.\u201d The Wall Street Journal editorial board openly urged regime change, writing: \u201cOnly a much tougher strategy aimed at toppling the Kim regime, with or without China\u2019s help, has a chance of eliminating a threat that puts millions of American lives at risk. The best option is a comprehensive strategy to change the Kim regime, as former undersecretary of state Robert Joseph has argued.\u201d In contrast, Daniel Larison of the American Conservative wrote: \u201cSeeking regime change in North Korea would be extremely dangerous and foolish. It would put millions of lives in jeopardy by risking war with the current regime. In the very unlikely event that this policy somehow \u2018worked\u2019 as intended, it would still create massive upheaval that would swamp South Korea with an unmanageable refugee crisis.\u201d Summarizing the situation in the Atlantic, Mark Bowden breaks down military options into either the complete devastation of Pyongyang or a \u201cturn the screws\u201d approach to hit selected reactors or nuclear test sites \u2013 attacks designed somehow to avoid all-out war. Bowden spoke with experts who said the \u201cdevastation\u201d scenario was politically not feasible on a global scale and maybe not militarily doable anyway. Bowden wrote: Suppose that US forces could be positioned secretly, and that President Moon were on board. Suppose, further, that Pyongyang\u2019s nukes could be disabled swiftly, its artillery batteries completely silenced, its missile platforms flattened, its leadership taken out\u2014all before a counterstrike of any consequence could be made. And suppose still further that North Korea\u2019s enormous army could be rapidly defeated, and that friendly casualties would remain surprisingly low, and that South Korea\u2019s economy would not be significantly hurt. And suppose yet further that China and Russia agreed to sit on the sidelines and watch their longtime ally fall. Then Kim Jong Un, with his bad haircut and his legion of note-taking, big-hat-wearing, kowtowing generals, would be gone. South Korea\u2019s fear of invasion from the North, gone. The menace of the state\u2019s using chemical and biological weapons, gone. The nuclear threat, gone. Such a stunning outcome would be a mighty triumph indeed! It would be a truly awesome display of American power and know-how. What would be left? North Korea, a country of more than 25 million people, would be adrift. In lieu of straightforward solutions to the North Korea conundrum, the US leadership has at times reverted to silence. \u201cThe United States has spoken enough about North Korea,\u201d US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said in a statement after a missile launch in early April. \u201cWe have no further comment.\u201d",
