    "content": "North Korea\u2019s self-proclaimed successful testing of a hydrogen bomb has succeeded in uniting the bifurcated field of Republican presidential candidates against a common enemy: Barack Obama. By the time the world\u2019s great powers joined together in universal condemnation of the hermit kingdom\u2019s latest nuclear provocation at a UN security council meeting on Wednesday morning, more than half a dozen contenders for the Republican nomination had issued statements decrying Obama\u2019s \u201cweakness\u201d, which they see as facilitating North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida led the charge with a late-night tweetstorm following news of the test, calling the detonation \u201cjust the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy\u201d. \u201cI have been warning throughout this campaign that North Korea is run by a lunatic who has been expanding his nuclear arsenal while President Obama has stood idly by,\u201d Rubio said in a statement. \u201cOur enemies around the world are taking advantage of Obama\u2019s weakness. We need new leadership that will stand up to people like Kim Jong-un and ensure our country has the capabilities necessary to keep America safe.\u201d Rubio\u2019s critique was echoed by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who decried Obama\u2019s \u201cweak response\u201d to North Korean nuclear aggressions under his watch. \u201cThree out of the four nuclear detonations that the North Koreans have done have happened under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch,\u201d Christie said during an appearance on Fox and Friends. \u201cThey have just not acted strongly at all around the world. This is just another example, piled on top of Iran, on top of Syria, on top Crimea and Ukraine ... this is what weak American leadership gets you.\u201d On CNN, Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who has been labelled a \u201ccommitted isolationist\u201d on foreign policy by Rubio and other rivals for the Republican nomination, redirected the question of North Korean nuclear aggression to a criticism of the comprehensive deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. \u201cI would say that there are many parallels to the Iran agreement,\u201d Paul said. \u201cMany of us said that that\u2019s the danger of the Iran agreement \u2013 once they get nuclear weapons, it\u2019s hard to know what to do and how you will respond.\u201d The test, North Korea\u2019s fourth since first detonating a \u201cfizzled\u201d atomic weapon in October 2006, prompted other candidates to join the coalition of the willing on social media: Largely missing from the condemnation of Obama\u2019s perceived lack of action on North Korea was condemnation of North Korea itself: beyond Paul, who on CNN criticized the north\u2019s \u201cfailed economic system\u201d as indicative of the superiority of capitalism over \u201csocialism\u201d, no would-be nominee has directed much ire in the direction of the repressive communist autocracy responsible for the test itself. Part of this may be rooted in the Republican field\u2019s general lack of coherent policy on North Korea, which has taken a back seat to the Islamic State, Russia and the Syrian civil war in most discussions of foreign policy this cycle. When asked for their candidate\u2019s positions on increased sanctions, boosting US troop presence on the 38th parallel or other possible responses to North Korean aggression, for example, press representatives for candidate Carly Fiorina provided the Guardian with a copy of a speech she gave on China in July. (The word \u201cKorea\u201d never appears in the transcript.) Obama has repeatedly imposed economic sanctions on North Korea as part of a policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d. Yet the universality of Republican condemnation of Obama\u2019s perceived \u201cweakness\u201d on North Korea was almost absolute, with the notable exception of billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump. The real estate tycoon, whose foreign policy bona fides is largely limited to his ownership of a golf course in Scotland, declined to pin the thermonuclear test on Obama, instead putting the lion\u2019s share of the blame on China. \u201cChina has total control, believe me,\u201d Trump told Fox and Friends on Wednesday. \u201cThey have total control over North Korea. Without China, they wouldn\u2019t eat,\u201d he said.",
