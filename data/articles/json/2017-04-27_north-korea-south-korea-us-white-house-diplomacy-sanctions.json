    "content": "The US has signalled sanctions and diplomatic pressure are its priorities for dealing with North Korea as senators who attended a White House briefing said they had not been presented with \u201ca specific military option\u201d. Tensions between the US and North Korea are already inflamed before an anticipated sixth nuclear test from Pyongyang, which has accelerated its long-range missile development programme. A statement on Thursday from the South Korean president\u2019s office said Seoul and Washington had agreed \u201cto swiftly take punitive measures\u201d against North Korea in the event of more provocation, following a telephone conversation between the US national security adviser, HR McMaster, and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Kwan-jin. \u201cThe two sides pledged that in the event of additional strategic provocation by the North to swiftly take punitive measures, including a new UN security council resolution, that are unbearable for the North,\u201d the statement said. It followed Wedensday\u2019s joint statement from the US secretary of state Rex Tillerson, secretary of defence James Mattis, and director of national intelligence Dan Coats, that said President Trump would pressure Pyongyang \u201cby tightening economic sanctions and pursuing diplomatic measures with our allies and regional partners\u201d \u2013 an approach adopted by the past three US administrations. It also said past efforts had failed to stop the advance of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee who attended the White House briefing, said senators \u201cwere not presented with any specific military option\u201d. The statement from the three cabinet officials also did not outline any additional military steps. Coons said a resolution of the \u201cvery difficult\u201d North Korea problem would require \u201cpersistent engaged allocation of diplomatic and military resources and effort\u201d. He said he believed Trump was developing a \u201cdiplomatic strategy that strikes me as clear-eyed and well proportioned to the threat\u201d. At the briefing, Trump asserted that a different course on North Korea diplomacy would stem from his ability to \u201cget things done\u201d, according to a Senate aide. But members of both parties were concerned that the White House did not have an effective plan \u201cand doesn\u2019t understand the level of effort necessary to reach a diplomatic solution\u201d, the aide said. Admiral Harry Harris, the commander of US Pacific Command (Pacom), told a congressional panel on Wednesday his goal was to bring Kim Jong-un \u201cto his senses, not to his knees\u201d.",
