    "content": "A confident leader strode into the Singapore summit and won. Kim Jong-un went with a plan, gave little and left with plenty: bolstered status and diplomatic leverage, lavish praise from the US president, the promise of an end to US-South Korean military drills \u2013 and, surely, a growing confidence that North Korea is doing well at this game. A meeting supposed to effect a breakthrough on denuclearisation looked \u201cmore like a big welcome party to the nuclear-armed club\u201d, in the acid but accurate words of one observer. Better than war, for sure. But since it was Donald Trump who raised that spectre, giving him credit for dispelling it would be like calling a man a life-saver when second thoughts stay his hand from murder. The US president handed over gift after gift in exchange for the inflation of his ego. He does not know or does not care that his country went home poorer than it came. The language in the joint statement was weaker than in previous agreements \u2013 the very significant difference being that the North is now much further advanced in its nuclear programme. There was not even a pledge that either side \u201cshall\u201d take action; just the assertion that North Korea will \u201ccommit to working towards\u201d denuclearisation, which it sees as a general, not unilateral, process. In return Mr Trump axed the drills with, it seems, no warning to Seoul (or even US forces). Worse, he described them as \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d, not just giving the North what it wanted, but suggesting it was right to demand it. He added that he hoped to withdraw US troops from South Korea at some point \u2013 further undermining the long alliance. Mr Trump\u2019s recounting of the meeting would have been laughable were it not so shocking. He explained to the North Koreans that they could have \u201cthe best hotels in the world\u201d on the beaches they use for artillery drills. He presented Mr Kim with a Hollywood-style movie trailer laying out the choice before him, complete with growling voiceover. He described the 100,000 or more North Koreans held in prison camps as \u201cone of the big winners\u201d of the meeting, though not even the vaguest assurance was extracted on their behalf. While finding time for another crack at Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau, he called Mr Kim \u201ca very talented man\u201d who wants to do the right thing and loves his country. He praised him for \u201crunning it tough\u201d (quite the euphemism for a dictatorship with human rights atrocities which the UN calls unparalleled in the modern world). And the comprehensive, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation on which the US was to insist? Ah: \u201cThere was no time!\u201d to cover that. But he would be surprised if the North Koreans hadn\u2019t begun already. Mr Trump thinks that the two sides probably have a rough transcript capturing all this, but does not need to verify anything because \u201cI have one of the great memories of all time\u201d. No satirist would dare to invent this. Hope for the best but don\u2019t expect much progress in lower-level talks next week; nor at meetings at the White House or in Pyongyang, mooted by the US president. China has already implied that it may be time to relax sanctions; South Korea and Russia have hinted that they are similarly minded. Even Mr Trump acknowledged that in six months\u2019 time it may emerge that the North Koreans are not taking action (adding, in a startling moment of candour, that \u201cI will find some sort of excuse\u201d rather than admit that). \u201cHe trusts me and I trust him,\u201d Mr Trump boldly declared of Mr Kim. But if the US president is so naive, surely the North Korean leader cannot be. In so far as the US president has any enduring belief, it appears to be that disruption is a good in and of itself: that throwing everyone else off-balance must benefit the world\u2019s only superpower, as one official has suggested (his colleague had a cruder characterisation). Withdrawal from the Iran deal proved that America\u2019s enemies cannot rely upon its word. The G7 and Singapore summits demonstrated that allies cannot either. But Tuesday\u2019s meeting also showed that Americans have reason to be wary. They too cannot count upon Mr Trump to live up to his promises.",
