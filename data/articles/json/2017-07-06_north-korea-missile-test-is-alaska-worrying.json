    "content": "Alaska\u2019s leaders say North Korea\u2019s test of intercontinental missiles proves the need for beefed-up missile defense in this frontier state. That\u2019s the politicians, anyway. Many Alaskans say they\u2019re more worried about bears than bombs. \u201cI was surprised they were able to get a missile to actually launch,\u201d Robert Church, a physician, said Thursday as he parked his mountain bike at a popular Anchorage park. Cottonwood seeds drifted to the grass all around him. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the threat, but I don\u2019t have a lot of confidence in the North Korea scientists making a functional rocket that could reach Alaska.\u201d Experts say the Tuesday launch demonstrated the ability of North Korea to put Alaska within firing range. Alaskans like 45-year-old Church, who grew up during the cold war, living closer to Russia than to the continental United States, have heard it all before. \u201cThe Russians would come and we\u2019d chase them off and shit. We\u2019d scramble some planes,\u201d said 40-year-old delivery driver David Brandt. He sat behind the wheel of a Ford F150 across town from the park, knocking ashes from his cigarette. Certainly other Alaska problems feel more immediate. Governor Bill Walker spent the morning surveying flood damage to homes and properties in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. Amid a pair of fatal black bear maulings, an opioid epidemic and a cratering state economy, the North Korea threat is just one of many worries making headlines in the state. Walker said North Korea\u2019s efforts highlight the need to \u201cexpand armed forces\u201d here, including a strategic Arctic port. \u201cGiven our proximity to growing foreign powers, and this week\u2019s test, that need is now more urgent than ever,\u201d he said on Thursday through a spokeswoman. Meanwhile, Alaska\u2019s only congressman, Don Young, is pushing legislation that would authorize an additional 28 ground-based interceptors south-east of Fairbanks. \u201cThe recent actions by North Korea, a rogue and irrational regime, underscores the importance of the Alaska\u2019s missile defense systems, including interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, and the future long range discrimination radar at Clear Air Force Station,\u201d a Young spokesman said. And Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, called the missile test a \u201cmatter of grave concern\u201d and warned against complacency. The test came as many Alaskans were distracted by hunting, fishing and fireworks over the holiday weekend. Mike McIntyre, a Yup\u2019ik musician, took his kids to a parade in the rural hub city of Bethel, about 40 miles from the Bering Sea. \u201cScary,\u201d McIntyre said of the North Korea threat. Those living in remote communities like Bethel feel as if they there are on the frontlines of any conflicts with foreign powers, he said \u2013 particularly as sea ice disappears, increasing accessibility to northern areas. \u201cThe Arctic Ocean ice has kind of opened up there and they could sail right to us,\u201d McIntyre said. In another riverside town, Paul Apfelbeck of Galena said random thoughts crossed his mind when he heard of the missile tests. Doesn\u2019t he live next to a former second world war-era military airfield? he mused. \u201cI was wondering about being on some old map and having the North Koreans use it as a demonstration shot,\u201d he said. In a sprawling state where life is on pause during the sun-drenched summer days, news of the missile test has been slow to reach some village and community leaders. \u201cI never heard anything about [the missile test],\u201d said Cassandra Ahkvaluk, a teacher\u2019s aide in the tiny Bering Strait village of Little Diomede. The hillside town is on an island just two miles across the international boundary line from Russia. Ahkvaluk, a former city mayor in the community of 118 people, says she\u2019s too young to remember the cold war. As for North Korea, their missiles didn\u2019t even rate water-cooler gossip this week. Her neighbors are busy gathering murre eggs and greens, hunting seal and walrus, she said. Everything else seems so far away. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d Ahkvaluk said. Back at the busy public park in Anchorage, 30-year-old Alyssa Wehrli thumbed her phone as kids crawled inside a rocket-shaped playground slide. \u201cIt\u2019s always been concerning that Alaska is an easy target for our enemies,\u201d Wehrlie said. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d She avoided news of North Korea, she said, but did hear about the unusual bear attack that killed a runner on a trail just down the highway. Everybody worried and talked about that. \u201cThey just pose a more immediate threat,\u201d she said.",
