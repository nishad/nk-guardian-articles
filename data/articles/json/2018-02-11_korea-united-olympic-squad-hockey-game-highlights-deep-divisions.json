    "content": "One minute Lee Yun-hwa was full of excitement, shouting her order in a tiny Gangneung pub for a plate of grilled intestines and a round of beer. The next minute she was sitting in stunned silence as Switzerland scored yet another goal against the Korean women\u2019s ice hockey team. It was supposed to be a moment of celebration \u2013 the first time in history that athletes from North and South Korea had played together in an Olympics. But as the loss deepened \u2013 Korea finally lost to Switzerland 8-0 \u2013 it was hard to find a silver lining. \u201cOverall it\u2019s good, but the timing is bad,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance for teambuilding, or for the players to get to know each other. That shows it\u2019s all a political stunt, and I feel bad for the South Korean players.\u201d The idea of a unified team is the brainchild of government officials from the two Koreas who met last month in the heavily fortified demilitarised zone. The squad is the centrepiece of the South Korean president Moon Jae-in\u2019s push to brand the games as the \u201cpeace Olympics\u201d and his goal of increasing exchanges between the two neighbours \u2013 technically still in conflict since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. No peace treaty has ever been signed. Moon himself, Kim Yo-jong \u2013 Kim Jong-un\u2019s sister and close confidante \u2013 and North Korea\u2019s ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam all cheered the combined team together from the VIP box and, hours before the game, Kim Yo-jong invited Moon to visit Pyongyang in what would be the first such summit since 2007. That sense of hope was not lost on others crowded into the bar. \u201cWe\u2019re one people,\u201d said one drinker. \u201cI\u2019m happy I can see that wish come true, even if it\u2019s just for a hockey game. It\u2019s our dream to be one country again. We\u2019re just like Germany before the wall fell.\u201d Kim Tae-hyun marvelled at the North\u2019s cheerleading squad, who performed synchronised movements in red uniforms throughout the sold-out match. \u201cSee, they are happy to see a unified Korea too,\u201d he said. From the moment the combined team was announced, however, it exposed deep divisions in South Korean society. Many were outraged at perceived unfairness to homegrown players. \u201cYoung people in South Korea have no memory of a united peninsula. They only know a North Korea that has attacked border islands and ships and threatens Seoul on a regular basis,\u201d says Youngmi Kim, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cMoon has been very accommodating to North Korea\u2019s desire to join the Olympics late, and that has been seen as deeply unfair.\u201d The combined team are the clear underdogs in the tournament. South Korea was already the lowest-ranked team before the addition of 12 less experienced players from North Korea, and only qualified as the hosts. The combined team must field at least three North Korean players each game out of a total of 22, according to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee. It presents a difficult choice for Canadian-American coach Sarah Murray: use players who have fought hard for a spot or those who joined at the last minute? That air of unfairness has been a sticking point among many ordinary Koreans. When Switzerland scored its seventh goal, Yong Soo-Kong started clapping. \u201cWhy are South Korean players who have worked very hard to reach the Olympics forced to sit and watch as these new faces just walk on?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like supporting those North Korea players, so I\u2019ll cheer for the other team now.\u201d As for the team, interactions off the ice remain limited to meal time. Back at the athlete\u2019s village, they bunk with their respective countries.",
