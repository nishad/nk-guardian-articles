    "content": "Late-night hosts on Tuesday addressed escalating tensions between the US and North Korea after Donald Trump responded to Kim Jong-un\u2019s continued threats with a promise to rain down \u201cfire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen\u201d. \u201cI know a lot of people tune in to this show on a nightly basis to get their news and information,\u201d CBS\u2019s Stephen Colbert began. \u201cThey count on me to be a straight shooter with a calm voice. I don\u2019t want to be alarmist. But we\u2019re all going to die. \u201cUS intelligence now believes that North Korea is now making missile-ready nuclear weapons,\u201d Colbert explained. \u201cMy God, Dennis Rodman, did you do nothing? \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, the story gets worse,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause over the weekend the UN security council voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. And in response,\u201d he said, citing the Wall Street Journal, \u201cNorth Korea warned that they are \u2018ready to teach the US a severe lesson with its nuclear strategic force\u2019, adding that \u2018other countries were not being threatened\u2019.\u201d \u201cLook, North Korea, stop trying to make us a thing, all right?\u201d Colbert joked. \u201cI\u2019m not saying what we have isn\u2019t special, but it\u2019s not exclusive. The United States, we sanction a lot of other countries. We sanctioned Russia just last week and it felt pretty great. Listen, they threaten us in a way you never will. You should see the size of their missiles.\u201d Colbert continued: \u201cThankfully, faced with the greatest challenge of his presidency, Donald Trump stepped up and in a moment of pure statesmanship, de-escalated the rhetoric and brought calm to our worried nation. I\u2019m just kidding. He said this.\u201d The host then showed a clip from Tuesday in which Donald Trump responded to the North Korean threat with one of his own: \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury ... and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.\u201d \u201cShut up!\u201d Colbert exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get us all killed and I just started The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. You know Kim Jong-un is crazy, right? He\u2019s a loose cannon like Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon. And also that one time he got pulled over. \u201cThe one ray of hope here is that I\u2019m not sure whether to believe Trump\u2019s nuclear saber-rattling, and neither are you,\u201d Colbert explained, referring to new polls showing broad distrust of the president. \u201cWhile only 24% of Americans trust what they hear from the White House, Trump\u2019s approval rating in the same poll is 38%. That means 14% of voters enjoy being lied to. If any of those people are tuning in right now, I just want to say, everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d Seth Meyers of NBC also weighed in, beginning: \u201cAccording to the Washington Post, North Korea now has the ability to fit a miniature nuclear warhead on missiles that are capable of reaching North America. Well, don\u2019t just stand there, tweet something! \u201cPresident Trump this afternoon addressed the North Korean missile program and said if they continue to threaten the US, they will be met with \u2018fire and fury like the world has never seen\u2019,\u201d Meyers continued. \u201cYeah, that ought to cool things down.\u201d \u201cNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un yesterday responded to new UN sanctions against the country, saying: \u2018There is no bigger mistake than the US believing that its land is safe across the ocean,\u2019\u201d the host went on. \u201cYeah, except for maybe that mistake where you\u2019re trying to even out your sideburns but you keep making one side shorter than the other so you go back and trim the other side, but now that side is shorter, so you go back and trim the other side, and before you know it you end up looking like this.\u201d Meyers then showed a photo of Kim. Jimmy Kimmel addressed the North Korea threat, too, as well as the fear incited by the president\u2019s aggressive rhetoric in response. \u201cToday started, it was a beautiful summer day here in LA, and suddenly I was on Google searching ways to survive a nuclear attack,\u201d Kimmel began before showing Trump\u2019s statement. \u201cFYI, there are no ways, it turns out. President Trump today took a break from his vacation to issue this extraordinary threat to North Korea. \u201cSo, as you can see, the vacation is really relaxing him. We\u2019re sorry we made fun of you. Go back to golfing before you kill all of us,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cI watched that clip about a dozen times today and after viewing number eight, I noticed this. Watch as it goes over. The camera pans over to Kellyanne. That is the face of someone who just realized she has to get up at 4am tomorrow to defend this all day.\u201d Kimmel continued: \u201cBy the way, he\u2019s making this crazy threat from a golf course. There\u2019s probably a little shop that sells range balls in the next room. US intelligence, by the way, assess that North Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could potentially reach California, Oregon, and Washington, three states that didn\u2019t vote for guess-who, by the way. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re one Trump toilet tweet away from being the United States of Florida,\u201d the host said. \u201cNorth Korea responded today by saying they\u2019re carefully examining a plan to strike the US territory of Guam. So they responded to the president\u2019s threat about not making any more threats with another threat. \u201cDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un both seem like reasonable men,\u201d he concluded, jokingly. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will work out fine.\u201d",
