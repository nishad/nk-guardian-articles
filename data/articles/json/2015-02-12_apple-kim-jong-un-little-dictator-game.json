    "content": "Apple has approved the release of mobile game Little Dictator on its App Store, weeks after initially rejecting the app due to its content spoofing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The game, developed by Built Games, is a Flappy Bird-inspired action title, with a cartoon Kim riding a missile through \u201cthe dangerous world outside the Fatherland\u201d. The free-to-play game includes power-ups like Father\u2019s Golf Clubs, Chicago Basketballs and GOP Hackers, making its money from selling virtual currency to buy them from its in-app store. Earlier in February, its developer said that the iOS version of the game had been rejected by Apple for flouting its App Store guideline on apps that are \u201cdefamatory, offensive, mean-spirited, or likely to place the targeted individual or group in harm\u2019s way\u201d. At the time, Built Games\u2019 Mike Pagano told Pocket Gamer that he was hopeful of changing Apple\u2019s mind. \u201cOur initial submission was rejected, an appeal has went in, and we are working with Apple to resolve,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the chances are very good for this game to see the light of day on the App Store.\u201d He\u2019s been proven right, with the iOS version now available alongside the existing Android edition of the game. Built Games\u2019 argument that the game was a fun spoof rather than mean-spirited appears to have won out. \u201cIn the infinitely unlikely event that the missile explodes before it reaches the evil west, more missiles will be supplied to try again and again\u2026 and again and again! Not to worry, Kim Jong-un possesses the hearts of his father and grandfather giving him ultimate endurance and strength to withstand any small mishaps along the way\u2026 very few of course!\u201d Little Dictator is far from the first game to spoof North Korea and its leader, nor is it the first to ring alarm bells within Apple\u2019s App Store approvals system. In 2013, Apple rejected a game called Joyful Executions, which put players in charge of a firing squad in North Korea, pitched as \u201ca parody game on North Korean propaganda for children and a satire on our willingness to accept morally questionable acts through gamification\u201d. More recently, a game called Glorious Leader! that would have seen players waging war on the US as Kim Jong-un had its Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign cancelled, with its developer citing a politically-inspired hacking attack as well as financial mistakes as the cause. Apple\u2019s decision to approve Little Dictator comes after widespread debate in the west about entertainment satirising North Korea, spurred by Sony Pictures\u2019 decision to cancel, then reinstate distribution of film comedy The Interview after the studio was hit by a high-profile cyber-attack. Apple was also criticised in December after initially rejecting Papers, Please \u2013 a critically acclaimed PC game set in a fictitious eastern European dictatorship. In that case, cartoon nudity rather than politics was the sticking point, but after protests, Apple rescinded its decision and approved the game in its original form.",
