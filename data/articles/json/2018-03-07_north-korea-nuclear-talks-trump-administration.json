    "content": "The Trump administration is considering how to respond to the North Korean offer of talks on its nuclear weapons programme at a time when its capacity to engage with Pyongyang has been hamstrung by the departure of its top Korea experts, according to former officials and analysts. The White House has said its policy of \u201cmaximum pressure and engagement\u201d was designed to use sanctions to push the regime of Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table to talk about the future of his nuclear weapons programme. But now that the North Korean leader has signalled a willingness to do that, it is unclear whether the administration has a plan for how to respond. Former officials say that the administration has spent a lot of time preparing sanctions and contingency planning for military action, but little or no time planning a negotiating strategy for use if Pyongyang entered serious talks. The last remaining US diplomat with experience of talking to the North Koreans, Joseph Yun, left his post on Friday, and the US currently has no ambassador in Seoul, since the White House withdrew the nomination of another experienced diplomat, Victor Cha. No replacement nominees have been announced. Yun and Cha were advocates of engagement with North Korea and were viewed with suspicion by the White House, where senior officials have argued for a military solution to the challenge posed by Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programme. Cha\u2019s nomination was withdrawn because he criticised a plan to carry out a \u201cbloody nose\u201d punitive strike against North Korean weapons sites. Stephen Miller, a hardline Trump adviser who has previously been associated with domestic policy, is reported to have ordered the withdrawal of Cha\u2019s nomination. A South Korean delegation returned from a visit to Pyongyang on Tuesday saying that the North Korean regime was ready to discuss the dismantling of its nuclear weapons programmes with the US, in return for guarantees of its security. Pyongyang is said to have offered to suspend nuclear and missile tests while talks were under way. These are precisely the conditions that the Trump administration had demanded before starting talks with the North Koreans \u2013 but its response so far has been non-committal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see. They seem to be acting positively but we\u2019re going to see,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cHopefully it will go the proper way,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe proper way is the way that everybody knows and everybody wants. But we are prepared to go either way.\u201d Jenny Town, the assistant director of the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said the ball was now in Trump\u2019s court. \u201cThis administration says the policy of maximum pressure and engagement is to bring North Korea back to the table to talk about denuclearisation,\u201d Town said. \u201cComing from Kim Jong-un himself, a willingness about denuclearisation is exactly what they have been looking for so if they don\u2019t seize this opportunity, I think it\u2019s going to call into a question a lot of what this policy is really about. I think you are going to see a drop-off in international support for pressure for pressure\u2019s sake.\u201d Trump\u2019s national security adviser, HR McMaster, has publicly argued that a nuclear-armed North Korea cannot be deterred and raised the prospect of a US preventive strike. McMaster\u2019s own position in the White House is in question and he is reported to be under consideration for a four-star general\u2019s job in the military. But one of the leading contenders for the national security adviser\u2019s job \u2013 John Bolton, who met Trump at the White House on Tuesday \u2013 is even more hawkish towards North Korea. \u201cThe main problem is that we don\u2019t know what the administration\u2019s policy is,\u201d said Philip Yun, a former state department official now at the Ploughshares Fund arms control advocacy group, who was involved in negotiations with the North Koreans during the Clinton administration. \u201cAnd if the North Koreans were interested in talks about talks, do they have the people to execute that.\u201d There are still respected Korean experts at the national security council and the CIA, but the loss of Yun and Cha is part of a much broader exodus of talent from the state department where the majority of top jobs remain unfilled 14 months after Trump took office. Any negotiations with Pyongyang would need close coordination with the South Korean government, but that is complicated, not just by the failure to nominate an ambassador to Seoul but also other Trump policies. Talks began on Wednesday on cost-sharing for the US military presence on the Korean peninsula. The discussions are likely to be contentious in the wake of the US president\u2019s claims that Seoul is not paying enough. And Trump\u2019s threat of steel tariffs would have a damaging economic effect on South Korea, the third biggest supplier of steel to the US.",
