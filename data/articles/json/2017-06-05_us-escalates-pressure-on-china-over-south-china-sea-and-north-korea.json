    "content": "The United States continues to escalate pressure on China over the twin issues of the South China Sea and North Korea, telling Beijing that with growing global influence comes increased responsibilities that it is failing to live up to. Three delegations of high-profile US leaders \u2013 the vice president, Mike Pence, senior GOP senator John McCain, and now secretaries of state and defence Rex Tillerson and James Mattis \u2013 have visited the Asia Pacific region in the past six weeks, with China\u2019s role in the region their highest public priority. The US is trenchantly opposed to China\u2019s island-building and militarisation in the South China Sea, and increasingly frustrated by China\u2019s inaction on reining in the nuclear ambitions of neighbour North Korea. Speaking in Sydney as part of AusMin \u2013 Australia and America\u2019s annual bilateral foreign, security and defence meeting \u2013 Tillerson said there was no room for negotiation on China\u2019s island-building in the South China Sea, which was found unlawful by the permanent court of arbitration in the Hague last year. \u201cWe oppose China\u2019s artificial island construction and their militarisation of those features in international waters,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cChina is a significant economic and trading power. We desire productive relationships, but we cannot allow China to use its economic power to buy its way out of other problems, whether it\u2019s militarising islands in the South China Sea or failing to put appropriate pressure on North Korea. \u201cThey must recognise that, with a role as a growing economic and trading power comes security responsibilities as well.\u201d McCain, in Sydney last week, described China as a \u201cbully\u201d that was using its economic muscle to coerce and intimidate other countries. \u201cThe challenge is that as China has grown wealthier and stronger, it seems to be acting more and more like a bully.\u201d Mattis told the Shangri-La regional defence summit in Singapore at the weekend: \u201cThe scope and effect of China\u2019s construction activities in the South China Sea differ from those of other countries in several key ways.\u201d \u201cThis includes the nature of its militarisation ... China\u2019s disregard for international law ... [and] its contempt for other nations\u2019 interests.\u201d China condemned Mattis\u2019s \u201cirresponsible remarks\u201d, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying arguing China had an indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly Islands \u2013 known by China as the Nansha Islands \u2013 where the US navy recently made its first freedom of navigation patrol under the Trump presidency. China would respect freedom of navigation, Hua said, but \u201copposes a certain country\u2019s show of force in the South China Sea under the pretext of navigation and overflight freedom, challenging and threatening China\u2019s sovereignty and security\u201d. Australia\u2019s shares the US position on China\u2019s presence in the South China Sea, although Australia was not part of the recent freedom of navigation exercise. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said the free flow of ships and commerce must not be impeded inside the nine-dash line, the area of the sea China claims, citing historical connection, as its territory. The court of arbitration found China had \u201cno historical rights\u201d to the territory. \u201cWe discussed regional co-operation in areas of maritime disputes, notably, the South China Sea,\u201d Bishop said on Monday. \u201cAnd we urge all nations to resolve their disputes peacefully and in accordance with the international rules-based order.\u201d North Korea\u2019s continued intransigence over its nuclear weapons program remains a threat to the region and the world, Tillerson said. Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime has launched a series of provocative missile tests in recent months, in defiance of increasingly frustrated rhetoric from the west. Tillerson said that China held the most power to curb North Korea\u2019s nascent nuclear program as it held an inordinate economic influence over its impoverished neighbour. \u201cToday, we also speak with one voice in calling for North Korea to abandon its illegal nuclear weapons program,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cChina and other regional partners should also step up their efforts to help solve this security situation which threatens not just that region, but really presents a threat to the entire world.\u201d Australia and the US both defended its long-term strategy in Afghanistan, a conflict to which both countries have already committed troops to for 16 years, saying it would not allow Afghanistan to become a platform for terrorists to operate from. Mattis said the Taliban did not enjoy popular support among the people of Afghanistan, so it used violence to intimidate them into submission. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, hard fight \u2026 the fight goes on, but the bottom line is we\u2019re not going to surrender civilisation to people who cannot win at the ballot box.\u201d",
