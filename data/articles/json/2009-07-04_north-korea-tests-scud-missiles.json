    "content": "The United States warned North Korea not to \"aggravate tensions\" today after South Korea said its neighbour had fired seven ballistic missiles in violation of UN resolutions. The tests, seen as a message of defiance to the US on Independence Day, will further increase pressure in the region as America tries to gather support for tough enforcement of the UN resolution imposed on the communist regime for its May nuclear test. US state department spokesman Karl Duckworth did not confirm the launches but described North Korea's behaviour as \"not helpful\". \"We are aware of possible missile launches by North Korea and are closely monitoring North Korea's activities and intentions,\" he said. \"North Korea should refrain from actions that aggravate tensions and focus on denuclearisation talks. This type of North Korean behaviour is not helpful.\" South Korea and Japan, which are within easy range of North Korean missiles, condemned the launches as a \"provocative\" act that violated the UN resolution. Russia and China called for calm, with Moscow saying in a statement that all sides should refrain from any steps that could further destabilise the region. They called for a return to six-party talks. South Korea's defence ministry said the missiles, which came two days after North Korea fired four short-range cruise missiles, were ballistic and were believed to have flown more than 250 miles. \"Our military is fully ready to counter any North Korean threats and provocations based on strong South Korea-US combined defence posture,\" South Korea's joint chiefs of Staff said in a statement. South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted military officials as saying the missiles appeared to be a type of Scud missile, which are considered short-range. North Korea is not allowed to fire Scuds, medium-range, or long-range missiles under a resolution that bans any launch using ballistic missile technology. Thursday's launches, however, did not violate the resolution as they were cruise missiles rather than ballistic, according to South Korea's foreign ministry. Ballistic missiles are guided during their ascent but fall freely when they descend. Cruise missiles are fired straight at a target. The North has a record of timing missile tests around the US national holiday. During the Independence Day holiday in 2006, Pyongyang fired a barrage of missiles, including a long-range Taepodong-2 that broke apart and fell into the ocean less than a minute after liftoff. Those launches also came amid tensions with the US over North Korea's nuclear programme. A senior official in South Korea's presidential office said today's missile launches were \"part of military exercises, but North Korea also appeared to have sent a message to the US\". He said North Korea could fire more missiles in coming days, but there was little possibility it could fire an intercontinental ballistic missile, as it threatened to do in April. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. North Korea's state news agency carried no reports of the launches. But the North had warned ships to stay away from its east coast until 10 July for military exercises \u2013 an indication it was planning missile operations. The chief of US naval operations, Admiral Gary Roughead, said the American military was ready for any North Korean missile tests. \"Our ships and forces here are prepared for the tracking of the missiles and observing the activities that are going on,\" Roughead said before the news of the launches. The US said last month it had positioned more missile defences around Hawaii as a precaution against a potential long-range missile launch by North Korea. Such a test would further flout the UN sanctions resolution punishing Pyongyang for its 25 May nuclear test. But spy satellites have apparently not detected any of the preparations that would normally precede such a launch. Pyongyang wants to show Washington that it is not yielding to pressure, and the regime is likely to save a long-range launch for later, according to Kim Yong-hyun, a professor at Seoul's Dongguk University and an expert on the country.",
