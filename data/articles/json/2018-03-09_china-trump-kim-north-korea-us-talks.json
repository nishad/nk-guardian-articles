    "content": "China has welcomed the announcement that Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un are plotting an unprecedented summit to discuss North Korea\u2019s weapons programmes but experts believe Beijing will also greet the news with trepidation and bitterness. Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing, the foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was pleased with the \u201cpositive signals\u201d. \u201cWe commend and will support the efforts made by all sides to solve this issue through dialogue and discussion,\u201d Geng said. \u201cWe hope all sides can show the political courage needed to make political decisions and start multilateral or bilateral meetings and to advance the process of peacefully resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula peacefully. China will continue to make efforts on this.\u201d Shen Dingli, an international relations specialist from Fudan University in Shanghai, said: \u201cTheoretically, Chinese authorities should feel happy. We always promote the idea of dialogue. Dialogue reduces the chance of conflict.\u201d Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert from the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy in Beijing, said: \u201cIn the short term I think Beijing will be pleased and will very much welcome the development.\u201d Zhao said there would, however, be nervousness about the possible ramifications of such a meeting. Some in Beijing fear Washington and Pyongyang may one day strike a deal that would bring China\u2019s historical ally closer to the US in exchange for US recognition of its \u201cnuclear reality\u201d. \u201c[They fear] the US would use North Korea \u2026 as a strategic balancer or as a hedge against a rising China in the region,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cChina knows very well that North Korea has always wanted to play this role \u2026 so there is this concern that \u2026 North Korea and the US might become closer and North Korea would become a longer-term security threat for China in the future.\u201d Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said China would welcome \u201cthe dramatic reduction of the danger of a military conflict\u201d on its doorstep. He said Beijing would also be pleased by Trump\u2019s apparent decision to embrace dialogue, claiming the planned rendezvous showed the US president recognised that his previous \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d approach of military threats and economic \u201cstrangulation\u201d had failed. Shi said Beijing would nevertheless be frustrated at being bypassed by the diplomatic initiative involving Korean and US officials. Beijing had damaged relations with Pyongyang by signing up to Trump\u2019s campaign of economic sanctions against North Korea last year, Shi said. Yet despite that support, Beijing faced the prospect of a trade war with the White House. \u201cI dare not say my government committed some major mistake [in going along with the sanctions],\u201d Shi joked. \u201cBut it is a fact that their actions have not been rewarded.\u201d An editorial in the Global Times, a party-run tabloid, scotched claims Beijing would oppose what it called an explosive and applaudable breakthrough. It said: \u201cChinese people should stay calm \u2026 and avoid the mentality that China is being marginalised. As a major power, it is unnecessary for China to worry about North Korea \u2018turning to the US\u2019.\u201d Zhao said the situation was so fast-moving it was impossible to say how the Trump-Kim meeting might play out. \u201cWe have no idea where it is heading \u2026 Is it really going to happen? I think it\u2019s too early to tell.\u201d However, Zhao and Shi agreed one certainty was that the meeting would not take place on Chinese soil. \u201cTrump is not on the Chinese side,\u201d said Shi. \u201cHe will not give China this credit.\u201d Zhao said: \u201cSomewhere in Russia might have a better chance.\u201d Japan, which has repeatedly cautioned the international community to be wary of falling for North Korea\u2019s charm offensive, scrambled to respond to the announcement. The Kyodo news agency quoted a senior foreign ministry official as saying the developments were \u201ca bit quick\u201d. Shinz\u014d Abe, the Japanese prime minister, discussed the matter in a 30-minute phone call with Trump that began shortly before South Korean officials announced the meeting plans. Abe will fly to the US early next month to further discuss the allies\u2019 strategy. \u201cThe solid position of Japan and the United States \u2013 that we will continue to put maximum pressure on North Korea until it takes concrete actions toward the complete, verifiable and irreversible abandonment of its nuclear [weapons] and missiles \u2013 is absolutely unwavering,\u201d Abe told reporters after the call. The defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said Japan was sticking to its view that the Kim regime needed to show concrete actions towards denuclearisation \u201cin order for dialogue to be meaningful\u201d.",
