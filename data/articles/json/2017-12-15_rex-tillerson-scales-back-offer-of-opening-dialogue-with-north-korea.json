    "content": "Rex Tillerson has said that the US was keeping channels of communication open with North Korea but said Pyongyang would have to \u201cearn its way back to the table\u201d with a \u201csustained cessation of threatening behaviour\u201d. In his remarks at a ministerial meeting of the UN security council, the US secretary of state appeared to restate an offer of a dialogue following a pause in nuclear and missile testing that he made on Tuesday, but cast it in tougher language following a rebuke from the White House. Tillerson omitted a line restating US openness to talks \u201cwithout pre-conditions\u201d that had been in a text of his speech circulated earlier by the state department. \u201cAs I said earlier this week, a sustained cessation of North Korea\u2019s threatening behavior must occur before talks can begin. North Korea must earn its way back to the table,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cThe pressure campaign must, and will, continue until denuclearization is achieved. We will, in the meantime, keep our channels of communication open.\u201d Speaking later at the security council meeting, the North Korean envoy Ja Song-nam ignored the US secretary of state\u2019s call for talks, claiming that the US was \u201cterrified by the incredible might of our Republic that has successfully achieved the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force\u201d. The UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said that a restoration of dialogue with Pyongyang was urgent. \u201cWe must do everything we can to reach that objective \u2013 and avoid a level of danger that would be unpredictable in its trajectory and catastrophic in its consequences,\u201d Guterres said. On Tuesday, Tillerson told an audience of foreign policy experts: \u201cWe\u2019re ready to talk any time North Korea would like to talk, and we\u2019re ready to have the first meeting without precondition\u201d. He said that the initial dialogue could be about the weather or the shape of the table, but added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have a period of quiet or it\u2019s going to be very difficult to have productive discussions.\u201d Hours later, however, the White House contradicted him, telling reporters that North Korea\u2019s test of an intercontinental missile in November meant that \u201cclearly right now is not the time\u201d for a dialogue. That was ruled out until Pyongyang \u201cfundamentally improves its behaviour\u201d. The mixed messages illuminated a rift between the White House and the state department on North Korea policy. The state department believes an early return to diplomatic contacts is essential to defuse tensions and avoid war by miscalculation, while the White House believes that economic pressure and military threats should be given more time to force Pyongyang\u2019s acceptanc that it will ultimately give up its nuclear weapons programme. Asked about his administration\u2019s policy on Friday, Donald Trump made non-committal remarks. \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to see what happens with North Korea. We have a lot of support,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of nations that agree with us \u2013 almost everybody. We can\u2019t let that happen. And we\u2019re going to see what happens with North Korea. We hope it works out.\u201d At the same day, the US special envoy for North Korea policy, Joseph Yun, echoed Tillerson\u2019s remarks during to a visit to Thailand. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to discern what their intent is without, as I said, having a real dialogue,\u201d Yun told reporters. \u201cWe are open to dialogue. And we hope they will agree to have a dialogue,\u201d In his remarks to the security council on Friday, Tillerson appeared to be \u201ctrying to square the circle between two different policies\u201d, said Mira Rapp-Hooper, senior research scholar in the China Centre at Yale Law School. \u201cHe may be pressing diplomacy especially hard because he finds the other streams of thought in the administration so horrifying. But his tenure is expected to be extremely short.\u201d Tillerson omitted a section in the draft version of the speech circulated to reporters before delivery that said that apart from a cessation in nuclear or missile tests \u201cthere are no preconditions for talks, nor will we accept pre-conditions from North Korea or others\u201d. In what has become a pattern, unnamed White House officials were quoted as making derogatory remarks about Tillerson on Friday. \u201cI think our allies know at this point he\u2019s not really speaking for the administration,\u201d one official told the Washington Post. Both Tillerson and Trump had denied reports that the White House was planning to fire the secretary of state, but the denials have done little to quash rumours of his departure.",
