    "content": "The Republican presidential frontrunner and an official from the People\u2019s Republic of Korea have clashed over nuclear weapons. Earlier this month Donald Trump suggested that Japan and South Korea should arm themselves rather than relying on the US to defend them. Comments that were branded \u201ctotally absurd and illogical\u201d by a North Korean official. It\u2019s not the first time Trump, who is renowned for his alarmist foreign policy statements, has taken aim at North Korea. In January he promised to make \u201cbad dude\u201d dictator Kim Jong-un \u201cdisappear\u201d if he became president. North Korea have been equally bellicose in their threats against the US recently, including the release of the menacingly-titled video \u201cLast Chance\u201d which shows Washington being wiped off the map by a nuclear attack. With the world left hoping that threats from both camps remain just that, we see if you can tell the difference between an official North Korean statement and a soundbite from Trump.",
