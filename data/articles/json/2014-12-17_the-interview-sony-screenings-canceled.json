    "content": "Hundreds of cinemas across the United States have cancelled screenings of a controversial movie at the centre of the Sony Pictures hacking scandal following terrorist threats made to cinema-goers by the group responsible for the attack. A group calling itself Guardians of Peace (GOP) published an online message on Tuesday warning cinema goers to stay away from screenings of The Interview, a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, which depicts the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. \u201cThe world will be full of fear\u201d, the message said. \u201cRemember the 11th of September 2001.\u201d The National Association of Theatre Owners (Nato) \u2013 the largest cinema trade group in the US, representing all 10 of the largest cinema operators in the country \u2013 said on Wednesday its members would decide individually whether to screen The Interview. The top five cinema chains \u2013 Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment, Cinemark, Carmike Cinemas and Cineplex Entertainment \u2013 have all dropped plans to screen the film, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Cinema operators are working with law enforcement agencies to assess the credibility of the threat, the trade group said, adding that while they were \u201cencouraged that authorities have made progress\u201d in their investigations, individual cinema operators \u201cmay decide to delay exhibition of the movie\u201d. The statement was released just as Bow Tie Cinemas, which has has 55 locations across the US including the world-famous Ziegfeld Theater in Manhattan, became the latest group to cancel screenings of the film. \u201cGiven that the source and credibility of these threats is unknown at the time of this announcement, we have decided after careful consideration not to open The Interview on December 25, 2014 as originally planned\u201d, Bow Tie said in a statement. The theatre association called an emergency meeting on Tuesday where Sony representatives told cinema groups they would be supportive of those that decided not to screen the film, according to accounts published by the Los Angeles Times. Anonymous officials from the Department of Homeland security have been quoted as saying they have \u201cno credible intelligence\u201d of a planned attack on cinemas as the investigation continues. The planned New York premiere of the film was cancelled on Tuesday. \u201cI think it is disgraceful that these theaters are not showing The Interview\u201d, tweeted the film director Judd Apatow. \u201cWill they pull any movie that gets an anonymous threat now?\u201d Sony Pictures has in damage control since a November hacking attack by GOP resulted in the theft of thousands of confidential documents, including personal emails, employee data, unreleased films, and information about executive pay and corporate profits. On Tuesday, former Sony pictures employees announced they were launching a class action for Sony\u2019s failure to ensure protection of their data. North Korea has denied responsibility for the hacking, but said it could be \u201ca righteous deed of the supporters and sympathisers\u201d of the country. California Senator Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the senate select committee on intelligence, described the threats as \u201cunconscionable\u201d. Feinstein said the hack was \u201conly the latest example of the need for serious legislation to improve the sharing of information between the private sector and the government to help companies strengthen cybersecurity\u201d. In the wake of controversy surrounding The Interview, another comedy set in North Korea has been reportedly dropped by its producers. Pyongyang, a film commissioned by New Regency pictures and set to star Steve Carrell playing a character accused of espionage by the regime, will no longer go into production, according to deadline.com.",
