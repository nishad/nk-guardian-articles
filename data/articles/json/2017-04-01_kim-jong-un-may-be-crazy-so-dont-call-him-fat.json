    "content": "US senator John McCain could have sparked a global war by calling North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un fat and crazy in a US television interview. Talking to MSNBC, the Republican senator said that only China could control \u201cthis crazy fat kid that\u2019s running North Korea\u201d. As is commonly known, Kim\u2019s moniker of choice is \u201cSupreme Leader\u201d, and a North Korean statement was released saying that, among other comments made against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea by prominent US politicians, McCain\u2019s \u201ccrazy fat kid\u201d jibe was \u201ca provocation little short of war\u201d. Kim Jong-un is rumoured to be touchy about his weight, a situation that isn\u2019t helped by reports that one of the most popular web searches in China is \u201cKim Fatty the Third\u201d. However, McCain is unrepentant, merely saying: \u201cWhat do they want me to call him \u2013 a crazy skinny kid?\u201d If all this reads like a belated April Fool\u2019s joke, you might want to start wishing it was. After all, Kim Jong-un has everything a young despot could want in life \u2013 including a nuclear military arsenal and a reputed yen to secretly stockpile enough missiles to wipe out America. While some of us may be loosely sympathetic with top-level concerns about the North Korean regime, I\u2019m not so sure that fattist insults are the mature and diplomatic way forward. Surely with Kim Jong-un there would appear to be plenty of other areas of immediate and pressing concern before you get anywhere near the rather crass topic of his weight \u2013 such as that twitchy genocidal thing he\u2019s got going on. In this spirit, could I please appeal to Senator McCain to stop with the fat jokes, lest they, of all things, lead to giant mushroom clouds enveloping the west.",
