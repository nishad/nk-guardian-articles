    "content": "When the UK\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office released details of its North Korean programme spending this week, some eyes were immediately drawn to the \u00a3287.33 the government paid for rights to show the BBC\u2019s Sherlock at the Pyongyang Film Festival in 2012. Never mind that it had been reported at the time, it got all the attention. But there\u2019s more of interest in the report, which was issued in response to a freedom of information request. In the last three years, the UK has hosted officials from the North Korean government on seven trips or events. In 2011 and again in 2012, 10 junior or middle-ranking government officials spent a month in Canterbury studying English and becoming \u201cmore aware of British systems, including in areas of media, justice and education.\u201d Two additional trips in the same years saw three political desk officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs come to London to engage on \u201cissues of direct interest\u201d to the UK government, \u201cincluding human rights and proliferation.\u201d Three members of the ruling Korea Worker\u2019s Party were also hosted on a visit in 2011, intended to improve understanding of UK\u2019s political system. They met representatives of the three main political parties, the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats, and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on North Korea in the House of Commons. In all, more than \u00a395,000 was spent hosting North Korean officials in the UK since 2011, according to the report. A relatively small \u00a3654 was spent to support to visit of North Korean officials from the Institute of Disarmament and Peace to visit the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London for a conference on North Korea. Attendance did, according to the report, help improve the DPRK officials understand the \"external view of DPRK Weapons of Mass Destruction programmes\". The UK has also funded several initiatives designed to promote the rights and visibility of disabled people in North Korea, including a donation of \u00a33,772 for an athlete to attend a Paralympic Games qualifying event in Berlin. It was the first time a North Korean had qualified. Money was also spent to send three athletes to the Asian Youth Para Games, where they came away with three silver medals and a bronze. Other programmes related to English-language education, health care, women\u2019s rights and energy. When added together, the UK has spent \u00a3724,133 since 2011 on programmes related to North Korea, according to the report. Most of it has gone on English-language education programs.
