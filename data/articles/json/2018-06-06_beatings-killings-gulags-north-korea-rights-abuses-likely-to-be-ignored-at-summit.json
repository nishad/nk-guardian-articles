    "content": "Lee Cheol cannot remember how many times he was forced to gather with his fellow soldiers at an airfield outside Pyongyang in North Korea and watch as firing squads executed enemies of the state. But one thing he does remember is that these public displays of violence increased under Kim Jong-un. \u201cI was very traumatised, I couldn\u2019t eat or sleep for days,\u201d Lee says, recalling the first time he was made to watch teams of soldiers unload their AK-47s into the condemned. \u201cI remember the sound of a person being hit by a bullet, it\u2019s very different from the sound of a target, but after seeing it so many times I became numb.\u201d Lee spent nearly eight years in the North Korean army, starting when he was 16. It was his only chance at a better life, and of going to university. But his military career was marked with intense violence that included public executions and regular beatings doled out on his unit as a form of collective punishment. It is estimated that between 80,000 and 120,000 political prisoners are detained in four large political prison camps in North Korea, according to a landmark United Nations inquiry that compiled evidence of a raft of crimes against humanity. The UN commission of inquiry found the regime\u2019s crimes included \u201cextermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation\u201d. The targets included people the regime considered a threat to the political system and leadership of North Korea. Human Rights Watch says North Korea remains one of the world\u2019s most repressive states despite recent diplomatic openings with South Korea, the United States, and other countries. Despite this, North Korea\u2019s plethora of human rights abuses are unlikely to be discussed in depth at a landmark summit between Donald Trump and Kim on 12 June in Singapore, with officials singularly focused on convincing the North to relinquish its nuclear weapons program. Luxury for some, starvation for others Lee worked in a construction brigade, toiling on government buildings and apartments for the country\u2019s elite. His faith in the regime began to deteriorate when he was assigned to one of Kim\u2019s vacation homes. \u201cWe were told everyone in North Korea was going through hardship together, but they were living in luxury,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt betrayed, like my whole life was a lie.\u201d A set of blueprints for one of those holiday retreats in the resort town of Wonsan went missing, and Lee was blamed. He escaped to his home town and was told by senior officials he would be executed if caught. He bribed his way out of North Korea last year, but still fears for his family and asked to use a pseudonym out of concern they may face reprisals. Michael Kirby, the former Australian judge who chaired the UN inquiry, says the \u201cgulag-like\u201d camps are a \u201ca very large aggregate of human suffering\u201d and the world has a responsibility to address the regime\u2019s \u201cmany crimes against humanity\u201d. Kirby hopes Trump will raise human rights with Kim when they meet and worries that if the topic is not brought up now, it might be hard to return to it down the track. \u201cIf there\u2019s no progress on human rights, you\u2019re never going to have peace and security on the Korean peninsula,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re then putting all of your eggs in the basket of hoping that economic progress which may be offered to North Korea will bring with it human rights developments. That sometimes happens, but it doesn\u2019t always happen.\u201d Trump did not mention the issue when he hosted Kim Yong-chol, a senior regime official, for talks at the White House last Friday, but the president has kept open the possibility of discussing human rights at the forthcoming summit with the North Korean leader. \u201cI think we probably will, and maybe in great detail,\u201d Trump told reporters after his meeting with the regime\u2019s former spy chief. North Korea has previously bristled at diplomatic efforts to raise the topic. The regime, which rejected offers to cooperate with the UN commission of inquiry, later claimed its findings were \u201cconcocted by the US and other hostile forces\u201d. Just last month, North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said the US should not \u201cdeliberately provoke\u201d the country by raising human rights issues and deploying strategic military assets in South Korea. Increasing brutality Kim, the third ruler in the dynasty, has been accused of ordering acts of extreme brutality as he moved to tighten his own grip on power. Lee observed a rise in executions of military officers after Kim came to power, and described increasingly brutal methods, including the use of explosive rounds that tore bodies apart as families were forced to watch. Kim\u2019s uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was executed in 2013 after being accused of plotting a coup and his estranged half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, died after assassins smeared a substance believed to be the banned chemical weapon VX in his face in Malaysia\u2019s Kuala Lumpur airport in February last year. The two women accused of his murder, who say they were tricked into taking part, are facing the death penalty. The US placed Kim on its sanctions blacklist in mid-2016 for complicity in human rights abuses. Paek Yosep has firsthand knowledge of the cruelty of the North Korean state. Paek, the son of an army political officer who was raised in relative comfort, fled the army when he was conscripted at 17. He was caught by Chinese police and sent back to North Korea where he was sent to a labor camp, which he described as \u201cone of the lightest possible sentences\u201d. While he was there interrogators would strip him naked and beat him with a belt and wooden sticks, and the guards forced him to stay awake for days on end. \u201cMost prisoners lie because they are afraid of being punished, and the authorities use violence to make people tell the truth,\u201d he says. But Paek and Lee\u2019s experiences are unlikely to register at a hastily arranged summit with designs on reshaping the regional political landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s a missed opportunity and unfortunate human rights are being sidelined in a rush to rapprochement and solving security problems,\u201d says Sokeel Park, director of research and strategy at the rights group Liberty in North Korea. \u201cEveryone sees North Korea as a security problem, but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a country and these problems are a symptom of its fundamental way of operating. Unless there are changes in the system, there won\u2019t be any lasting breakthroughs,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a normal security relationship with such an abnormal country.\u201d With additional reporting by Junho Lee",
