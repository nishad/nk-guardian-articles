    "content": "Dear Marshal Professor Kim Jong-un, Supreme Leader, We most humbly request you come out of the bathroom. You\u2019ve been in there over a week now. The people need reassurance about your wellbeing. There are rumours. Best, The Army High Command, The Congress of People\u2019s Deputies, The People of North Korea I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Fuck off. Send in some cheddar. Not a mild one. Something with a bit of a kick. Dear Marshal Professor Kim Jong-un, Supreme Leader, But it would be so great to see you again! Everyone really misses your humorous ways and brilliant edicts. Is it something we said? We liquidated most of the political apparatus in Kangwon province. Some of the guys thought they might be bothering you. Can you at least tell us why you will not come out? Best, The Army High Command, The Congress of People\u2019s Deputies, The People of North Korea I DON\u2019T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. Send me some tasty manchego. And the print-outs from today\u2019s Mail Online. (Also \u2013 the lab must work overtime. I demand a breakthrough in the Secret Programme!!!!!!) Dear Great Leader, OK. Was it that picture that sent you in there? We thought you looked suave. As you\u2019ll see, there is in fact a story about you and another photo in the Mail Online. Don\u2019t kill the messengers! Really. Please don\u2019t. We thought maybe we wouldn\u2019t send this through \u2013 but we all had a big talk and in case you kill any of us for disobeying you :) we have sent it through! Please don\u2019t kill any of us! :) :) !!!!! Best, The Army High Command, The Congress of People\u2019s Deputies, The People of North Korea Dear Great Leader, Hello? Best, The Army High Command, The Congress of People\u2019s Deputies, The People of North Korea That is so unkind. I thought the last one was bad but. Seriously! It\u2019s so clear they\u2019ve looked at loads and loads of photos and picked one where, for a second, yes I do look like kind of puffy, but that\u2019s one photo. It\u2019s SUCH BULLSHIT. I\u2019m sick and tired of this. It\u2019s undermining my whole political agenda about equality and so on. It messes with someone\u2019s confidence. And then they do like A HUNDRED PAGES of pictures from the X-Men premiere? SERIOUSLY? I electrify a whole region and what do I get? Spiteful comments. It\u2019s crazy they can keep on pulling this shit!! Dear Great Leader, Remember, haters gonna hate! Best, The Army High Command, The Congress of People\u2019s Deputies, The People of North Korea Yes haters gonna hate. Of course. OBVIOUSLY HATERS GONNA HATE. I said that ONE TIME in politburo and now it\u2019s like I can have all my problems solved by you saying it back to me! Haters gonna hate is probably not even Marxism-Leninism so probably you shouldn\u2019t be saying it to me. I\u2019m sending back the \u2018parmesan\u2019. It\u2019s totally flavourless. Liquidate those responsible. I wanted reserve gruy\u00e8re and this is no substitute. What are they saying today? Have they done any more on me? Those MASSIVE SHITS. Dear Great Leader, OK. Please don\u2019t become irate :)! but today the Mail Online is extremely decadent, ideologically unsound. More than normal. They say you looked \u201cbloated\u201d at your visit to the rations plant. That maybe you haven\u2019t been out in public lately because you\u2019re \u201chaving a gastric band fitted\u201d. That you couldn\u2019t even close your lab coat because your \u201ctummy is too large\u201d. That in the pictures you look at the rations \u201cwith interest\u201d and that you might have a \u201cdangerously high consumption of emmental cheese\u201d. Best, The Army High Command, The Congress of People\u2019s Deputies, The People of North Korea How can they even say that? That\u2019s not journalism! What is that? What, like I\u2019m going to just eat all the rations cos I\u2019m so monstrously greedy??? They just make things up now? Fuck. It eats away at your trust kind of thing, you know? They might be interested to know, IF THEY EVEN ASKED, that the reason I didn\u2019t do up my lab coat is because I wanted to show off my birthday jacket cos I thought people MIGHT ACTUALLY LIKE IT and think it was a bit of flair and I might get into a Best Dressed Top 10 like all those things aren\u2019t total inside jobs sewn up by a tiny clique of magazine editors and capitalists. Ha! Well more fool me for trying to freshen up my wardrobe! This is so horrible. They take every little detail and twist it to make it like it\u2019s horrible. This is the first step in counter-revolution!!!!!! Release the rockets!!!! All must burn!!!!!!!!! Dear Great Leader, Definitely? Best, The Army High Command, The Congress of People\u2019s Deputies, The People of North Korea Launch the rockets!!!! All of them!!!!!! (Anything on Popbitch, etc?) I am indefatigable! Launch launch launch!!!! Dear Great Leader, Super definitely? (Nothing on Popbitch, etc.) Best, The Army High Command, People\u2019s Deputies, The People of North Korea I\u2019ve been in here four weeks and it\u2019s getting ridiculous. It\u2019s LIKE HELL IN HERE. Cancel the Secret Programme, it is never going to synthesise a really good emmental out of rubber waste. If it wasn\u2019t one of the presidential bathrooms with a sleeping annexe, basic marble kitchen, exercise room and multimedia enjoyment centre, I don\u2019t know how I would cope in here. Release the rockets!!!!!! Dear Great Leader, Definitely, definitely? Best, The Army High Command, People\u2019s Deputies, The People of North Korea Maybe hold on. I think we could be on to something with the barrel-aged feta. It\u2019s got a very promising texture. I might come out for a bit. \u2022 Jesse Armstrong is co-creator and writer of Peep Show and Fresh Meat. His first novel, Love, Sex And Other Foreign Policy Goals, will be published by Jonathan Cape in April.
