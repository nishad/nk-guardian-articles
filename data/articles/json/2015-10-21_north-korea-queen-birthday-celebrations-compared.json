    "content": "\u201cIt was a birthday celebration, but it felt more like a cult meeting in adoration of the leader. Row upon row of soldiers and civilians \u2026 marched in a minutely choreographed formation for two hours,\u201d reported the BBC during a recent report from North Korea. But the accompanying video does not pan over lavish celebrations held in Pyongyang to mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean Workers\u2019 Party. Instead it has been dubbed over flag-waving birthday celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II, the UK\u2019s unelected head of state. \u201cA signal of unity, fearsome missiles means they [are] ready to fight any kind of war,\u201d the BBC\u2019s Seoul correspondent Stephen Evans goes on to say in the BBC clip, referencing North Korea\u2019s penchant for displays of nuclear might and the fears that Kim Jong-un, the DPRK\u2019s leader, would use the celebration to launch a nuclear missile test. But Evans\u2019 voiceover fits just as comfortably with footage of a flyover by the Red Arrows \u2013 the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team who are regularly deployed on big national occasions, peppering London\u2019s sky in patriotic red, white and blue smoke. But the video mashup \u2013 first uploaded to YouTube last week \u2013 is a humorous take on the UK\u2019s fascination with North Korea, while showing up how the country\u2019s media are seemingly blinded to our own national eccentricities. Of course, the comparison is crude: the UK is a healthy democracy whilst the DPRK has only known leaders from one adulated family, the Kims. North Korea has been accused of human rights abuses on the scale of the Nazi holocaust by United Nations Human Rights council, of which the UK is a member. In the new edit, adoring citizens are shown singing and waving the union jack in front of the Queen and her offspring, while the voiceover describes footage of North Koreans celebrating under the watchful (and forceful) eye of their authoritarian government. \u201cIt does arguably highlight an uncomfortable truth about idolisation,\u201d wrote the Independent \u201cas well as just how ridiculous the trooping of the colour really is\u201d \u2013 referring to the British military spectacle which has been held on the sovereign\u2019s birthday since the 17th century. \u201cOver 1,400 officers and men are on parade, together with 200 horses; over 400 musicians from 10 bands and corps of drums march and play as one,\u201d explains the Seven British Army Regiments\u2019 official website. The BBC were just some of a host of broadcasters, correspondents and tourists who poured into the secret state for the celebrations earlier this month.",
