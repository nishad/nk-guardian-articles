    "content": "Boris Johnson is to hail the importance of coordinated international diplomacy to counter the threat from nuclear weapons and North Korea in a speech to stake out a position at clear odds with the more bellicose rhetoric of Donald Trump. While Johnson will stress that the US president has \u201can absolute duty\u201d to prepare for a possible military option if North Korea is about to attack the United States, the foreign secretary will say diplomatic efforts must be paramount. In a speech to be made on Monday to the annual conference of the Chatham House thinktank in London, Johnson will single out for praise Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, who has annoyed Trump by pushing for dialogue with Pyongyang. Johnson is also to use his speech, extracts of which were released in advance by the Foreign Office, to praise the Iran nuclear deal, another diplomatic effort repeatedly condemned by Trump. The speech says the carefully arranged international nuclear deal with Iran should act as a model for dealings with North Korea \u2013 an emphasis on seeking diplomatic solutions while keeping open the option of military action. \u201cThat is the model \u2013 of toughness but engagement, each reinforcing the other \u2013 that we should have at the front of our mind as we try to resolve the tensions in the Korean peninsula,\u201d Johnson is to say. \u201cIt is right that Rex Tillerson has specifically opened the door to dialogue. He has tried to give some sensible reassurances to the regime, to enable them to take up this offer.\u201d While the government is careful to avoid directly criticising Trump, Johnson is making it very clear by highlighting Tillerson\u2019s method that he does not support the US president\u2019s notably more aggressive approach. Trump said earlier this month that Tillerson was \u201cwasting his time\u201d trying to negotiate with \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d, the derogatory name he uses for the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Amid reports of wider disagreements between Trump and Tillerson, the secretary of state has said he is not about to resign, while declining to deny that he has called the president a \u201cmoron\u201d. Many of the extracts of Johnson\u2019s speech deal with what he terms the success of the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which he says has greatly curbed the spread of the technology. \u201cWhen you consider that every previous military development \u2013 from firearms to fighter jets \u2013 has spread among humanity like impetigo, you have to ask yourselves: why? Why have nuclear weapons been the great exception?\u201d he is to say. \u201cThe answer is partly that many countries wisely decided, after the war, that they were going to take shelter under the nuclear umbrella provided by the US \u2026 And it was that American offer \u2013 that guarantee \u2013 that made possible the global consensus embodied by the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty.\u201d Hailing the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has said he will not re-certify, Johnson will say it is up to the North Korean regime to reach a similar international agreement to end its programme of nuclear and missile tests. \u201cThis is the moment for North Korea\u2019s regime to change course \u2013 and, if they do, the world can show that it is once again capable of the diplomatic imagination that produced the nuclear non-proliferation treaty \u2013 arduously negotiated \u2013 and that after 12 years of continuous effort produced the JCPOA [joint comprehensive plan of action] nuclear deal with Iran.\u201d Johnson is to stress that North Korea should be aware that in the event of a threatened attack, Trump or any US president \u201cwill have an absolute duty to prepare any option to keep safe not only the American people but all those who have sheltered under the American nuclear umbrella\u201d. But he will stress the importance of a diplomatic deal: \u201cA new generation has grown up with no memory of the threat of a nuclear winter, and little education in the appalling logic of mutually assured destruction. The memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is now literally fading from living memory.\u201d It is, Johnson will add, \u201cthe job of our generation\u201d to preserve nuclear non-proliferation efforts.",
