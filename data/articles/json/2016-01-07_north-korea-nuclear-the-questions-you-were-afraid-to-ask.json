    "content": "At 10am Pyongyang time on Wednesday the Korean peninsula felt a seismic shake said to measure 5.1 on the moment magnitude scale. It wasn\u2019t an earthquake, it quickly transpired, but an alleged fourth nuclear test carried out by the North Korean government. As the news ricocheted around the world, people began to question the size and scale of the explosion that North Korea claimed had been produced by a miniature hydrogen bomb. Did we know this was coming? Does it signal that Kim Jong-un\u2019s powers are growing? Should North Korea\u2019s neighbours be scared? And what are the consequences for international diplomacy with the infamous pariah state? We bring you answers to some of the key questions raised across the Guardian\u2019s comment threads \u2013 that you may be too embarrassed to ask yourself. Where was it? The blast is said to have taken place underground the nuclear test site of Punggye-ri, in the east of country. The test site had even secured its own spot on Google maps back in 2013, though visitors are unlikely to see a sign leading to Nuclear Test Road and the positive reviews for \u201corange chicken\u201d and \u201cloud bangs\u201d are to be taken with a rather large pinch of salt. Are we looking at an H-bomb? Probably not \u201cThe first H-bomb test was successfully conducted in the DPRK at 10:00 on Wednesday, Juche 105 (2016), pursuant to the strategic determination of the WPK (The Korean Worker\u2019s Party),\u201d read a triumphant statement from state media outlet KCNA. But the claim was robustly questioned by international nuclear experts. According to Lassina Zerbo, who heads the international agency tasked with measuring nuclear reactions, all signs indicated \u2013 in terms of location and magnitude \u2013 that it was a test on a similar scale to one launched by the regime in 2013. If it was a hydrogen bomb the ripple felt by the explosion would be bigger, though the ultimate aim is to make the actual weapon smaller, explained the BBC. Another possibility is that the weapon is a hybrid, \u201ca boosted fission\u201d, a standard fission weapon spiked with isotopes like hydrogen or lithium, said the New Scientist. In other words: a step towards a usable nuclear missile. According to nuclear expert John Carlson, the North Koreans are aiming to develop something \u201csmall enough and light enough to put on to a missile ... less than one metre in diameter, and less than a tonne in weight\u201d. Whether they have that capacity is another subject of speculation. Why don\u2019t we know yet? Some readers asked why \u2013 with the level of technology available to North Korean observers \u2013 we couldn\u2019t tell immediately what type of bomb North Korea had detonated? Zerbo shared a step-by-step video explaining how his team at the preparatory commission for the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (Ctbto) detect explosions by tracking \u201cblast waves\u201d that take place on, above or \u2013 in the case of North Korea \u2013 inside the Earth. And it\u2019s not easy. Underground explosions are the \u201ctough ones\u201d to measure according to the video, but are monitored using the same technology that detect earthquakes. Previous \u201cunusual disturbances\u201d detected beneath North Korea have all turned out to be nuclear tests. This information is then combined with data from detectors monitoring the air for radioactive gasses, which use advanced weather technology. Zerbo estimated that it could take up to 72 hours for such particles to reach their monitoring stations in Japan and Russia. Scientists may then be able to determine whether a hydrogen bomb was involved. Japan and the US were also reported to have dispatched sniffer planes to search for radioactive material. How dangerous is Kim Jong-un? The significance of the date, two days before Kim Jong-un\u2019s 33rd birthday, did not go unnoticed by many North Korean watchers, and readers wanted to know how dangerous the young dictator might be to global stability. While countries from Sweden to South Korea, Russia to the US joined the international chorus of condemnation \u2013 and Nato accused North Korea of undermining global security \u2013 the jury is still out as to whether they are any more dangerous as a nuclear power. A fourth nuclear test has been expected for a while \u2013 with some predicting that it would coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Korean Workers Party on 10 October 2015 \u2013 but there had been no indication that the leader would press the button today. There was not a flicker of it in Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s address, for example. By deploying the element of surprise Kim was able to reaffirm his \u201creputation as a dangerous maverick and international outlaw\u201d, wrote the Guardian\u2019s Simon Tisdall. It could be attention-seeking; the prelude to a new offer of normalisation talks driven by domestic weakness, or simply Kim\u2019s idea of birthday fun, he concluded. Either way Beijing, formerly Pyongyang\u2019s closest ally, stands to be the most perturbed. They were not given advanced warning of the test, and indicated that they would support UN action. But they have a dilemma: they do not want to throw delicate diplomatic relations out the window, and if they apply too much pressure they risk the consequences of full economic meltdown on their doorstep. What can we do? Even if it is an H-bomb, can the world do anything but dish out condemnation, asked some. As with the response to the tests of 2006, 2009 and 2013, the UN is considering punitive sanctions but Korean specialist Andrei Lankov argued that this would merely result in depriving the elite of their \u201cHennessey cognac and Godiva chocolate\u201d. The country would not give up its nuclear weapons, which would be \u201ctantamount to collective suicide\u201d. \u201cThe only hope might be some kind of negotiations, which are ostensibly aimed at resulting in the eventual denuclearisation of North Korea but in actuality limited to negotiating a freeze of the nuclear program,\u201d he added. What about the North Koreans? Others raised concerns about the plight of the ordinary North Korean people, but with no independent media operating inside the dictatorship it is impossible to get a true sense of national feeling beyond the state media propaganda images of jubilant celebrations in Pyongyang\u2019s Central square. Elsewhere, tour companies said they expected to keep taking western tourists in to the country as normal. \u201cThe only things that have caused tours to be cancelled in the last few years have been Sars in 2003, and Ebola in 2014-2015. The nuclear tests previously haven\u2019t had any effect on tourism,\u201d said Simon Cockrell of Koryo Tours, who was planning to leave for Pyongyang today.",
