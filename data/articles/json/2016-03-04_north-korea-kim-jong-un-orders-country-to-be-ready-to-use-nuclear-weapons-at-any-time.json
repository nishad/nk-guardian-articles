    "content": "North Korea should be ready to use nuclear weapons \u201cat any time\u201d in the face of a growing threat from its enemies, leader Kim Jong-un has decreed in a further escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. Kim\u2019s warning, issued via state-controlled media on Friday morning, appeared to be an attempt to put pressure on the international community after the UN security council on Wednesday adopted a raft of new sanctions against the regime in response to its recent nuclear test and rocket launch. Kim, who was supervising the test-firing of newly developed multiple rocket launchers, said North Korea\u2019s situation had become so perilous that it should have the option of launching a \u201cpre-emptive attack\u201d \u2013 a departure from previous claims that the North\u2019s nuclear capability was purely a deterrent. In an apparent threat to neighbouring South Korea, Kim said the new rocket launchers should be \u201cpromptly deployed\u201d along with other new weaponry. He said the regime\u2019s enemies \u2013 notably the US \u2013 were threatening North Korea\u2019s survival, the state-controlled KCNA news agency reported. \u201cAt an extreme time when the Americans ... are urging war and disaster on other countries and people, the only way to defend our sovereignty and right to live is to bolster our nuclear capability,\u201d KCNA quoted Kim as saying. \u201cUnder the extreme situation that the US imperialist is misusing its military influence and is pressuring other countries and people to start war and catastrophe, the only way for our people to protect sovereignty and rights to live is to strengthen the quality and quantity of nuclear power and realise the balance of power. \u201cWe must always be ready to fire our nuclear warheads at any time.\u201d People in the capital, Pyongyang, said the new round of UN sanctions would not affect the country\u2019s progress. \u201cNo kind of sanctions will ever work on us, because we\u2019ve lived under US sanctions for more than half a century,\u201d Pyongyang resident Song Hyo-il told the Associated Press. \u201cAnd in the future we\u2019re going to build a powerful and prosperous country here, relying on our own development.\u201d The US defence department urged the North to \u201crefrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions, and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments\u201d. \u201cWe are aware of the reports and are closely monitoring the situation on the Korean peninsula in coordination with our regional allies,\u201d said Commander Bill Urban, a Pentagon spokesman. The UN sanctions target mineral exports and other key sectors of the North Korean economy, as well as requiring member states to inspect cargo shipments to and from the North that go via their ports. The measures, passed on Wednesday, are designed to limit North Korea\u2019s ability to earn foreign currency, which it then uses to fund its nuclear and missile programmes. On Friday the Philippines coast guard announced it had detained a North Korean cargo ship that docked at the port of Subic Bay after arriving from Balembang, Indonesia. The MV Jin Teng was carrying a palm oil byproduct used as livestock food, Philippines authorities said. Nothing suspicious was found by inspectors and bomb sniffer dogs, but safety defects would need to be fixed before the vessel would be allowed to continue its journey to south-western China\u2019s Zhanjiang port. The ship\u2019s documents showed the cargo was for consignees in the Philippines and no new cargo would be loaded at Subic Bay, said coast guard Commander Raul Belesario. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China, North Korea\u2019s closest ally, hoped the UN sanctions would be implemented \u201ccomprehensively and seriously\u201d, while harm to ordinary North Korean citizens would be avoided. At the United Nations, Russia\u2019s ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, asked about the North\u2019s firing of short-range projectiles, said: \u201cIt means that they\u2019re not drawing the proper conclusions yet.\u201d Japan\u2019s UN ambassador, Motohide Yoshikawa, said: \u201cThat\u2019s their way of reacting to what we have decided. They may do something more \u2026 so we will see.\u201d While North Korea is believed to possess a small stockpile of nuclear warheads, most experts say the regime has yet to develop the technology to miniaturise them so they can be mounted on a missile. This is not the first time that Kim \u2013 who became leader in late 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il \u2013 has issued threats to the west. In 2013 he threatened a nuclear strike on the US mainland in response to sanctions imposed after North Korea carried out its third nuclear test and the US held its traditional joint military manoeuvres with South Korea \u2013 exercises that Pyongyang regards as a rehearsal for an invasion of the North. Dr Leonid Petrov, an expert on North Korea from the Australian National University, said Friday\u2019s statement was not an idle threat. \u201cNorth Korea is prepared to go a long way in this,\u201d Petrov told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey believe it\u2019s the only way they can protect their regime. The survival of the regime is the main concern for the North Korean leadership.\u201d Petrov said the statement was intended to send a message to the UN security council, including formerly more friendly nations Russia and China. \u201cI think North Korea [is] simply mirroring the US rhetoric that nuclear weapons may be used pre-emptively and that\u2019s what North Korea believes they also have the right to do,\u201d he said. Friday\u2019s warning to the west came after North Korea fired a volley of short-range missiles into the sea off its east coast. This followed the UN security council\u2019s unanimous decision to impose the toughest sanctions against the regime in two decades over its nuclear and rocket tests. North Korea has previously carried out live firing near or across its borders when facing international condemnation. Tilman Ruff, a Melbourne University academic and nuclear disarmament advocate, said that despite North Korea\u2019s \u201creally frightening and belligerent\u201d threats he believed its programme to develop a bomb remained mostly a political tool. \u201cI think the leadership would be cognisant of the fact that the military response that would follow any nuclear assault on their behalf would be the end of the regime and possibly take out most of the North Korean population,\u201d he said. Tilman said that even if the regime had a proven long-range missile delivery system, the country\u2019s nuclear weapons cache was small. \u201cThey have got probably less than 10 relatively crude nuclear weapons, in the global scale of 15,530 \u2026 that\u2019s less than a 10th of a percent of the global nuclear arsenal,\u201d he said. \u201cI really do think that their nuclear programme is primarily about achieving political attention and trying to get the US attention in particular.\u201d",
