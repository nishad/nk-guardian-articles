    "content": "Theresa May has reiterated her call for China to put more pressure on North Korea to limit its missile programmes as the UK tries to get Beijing to participate in imposing tougher sanctions on Pyongyang. After a state-linked Chinese newspaper labelled May \u201cweak\u201d for pressing China over the issue, the prime minister told a press conference in Tokyo that Beijing needed to match its words of condemnation towards North Korea with deeds. It is understood that Britain is backing international moves for oil exports from North Korea to China to be barred under beefed-up sanctions in response to Pyongyang\u2019s decision to fire a missile over northern Japan on Tuesday. This would follow an earlier ban on North Korean coal, iron and lead imports to China, Pyongyang\u2019s biggest trading partner and occasional ally. May, who said on Wednesday that China was \u201cthe key\u201d to international pressure on North Korea, told a press conference alongside Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that action was required. \u201cChina has been involved,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was involved during the UN security council debate earlier this week, and there was condemnation from that debate from all parties on the actions that North Korea had taken. \u201cNow we need to ensure that it\u2019s not just the words of condemnation, but that action is taken. And China does have a particular position in this. \u201cThey have leverage on North Korea and I believe we should be encouraging China to exercise that leverage to do what we all want, which is to ensure that North Korea is not conducting these illegal acts and we can ensure the security and safety of nations in this region, including, of course, Japan.\u201d Speaking at the press conference, Abe said the UK had its own reasons to counter the \u201cunprecedented, serious and grave threat\u201d from North Korea, beyond just supporting Japan. \u201cThey [North Korea] have conducted two launches of ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles]. That threat is felt not just by our country or Asia alone. It has become a global threat, including Europe. North Korea will launch ICBMs again and the range will include almost the entire region of Europe.\u201d Earlier on Thursday, the Global Times, a nationalist Chinese Communist party tabloid that sometimes reflects official views, linked May\u2019s earlier comments to the June general election in which her Conservative party squandered its parliamentary majority. \u201cMay\u2019s Conservative party lost many seats, turning her into a vulnerable prime minister,\u201d argued an editorial in the newspaper\u2019s Chinese-language edition. \u201cWeak people often look for opportunities to show their \u2018strength\u2019.\u201d \u201cPerhaps prime minister May doesn\u2019t know much about the Korean peninsula. Her comments sounded just like a rehashing of Washington\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d the sometimes undiplomatic newspaper continued, claiming that many Chinese citizens felt puzzled by what it called British meddling in Asian affairs. \u201cIf the British government genuinely wants to protects its business and investment interests in the region, it should speak and act cautiously ... rather than pointing fingers and making irrelevant remarks,\u201d added the article, which was headlined: \u201cBeijing does not need London to teach it how to deal with North Korea.\u201d",
