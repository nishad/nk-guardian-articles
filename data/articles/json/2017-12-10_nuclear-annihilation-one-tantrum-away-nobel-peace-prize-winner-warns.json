    "content": "The destruction of humankind is one \u201cimpulsive tantrum away\u201d, the Australian-founded winner of the Nobel peace prize, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, warned overnight on Sunday as the United States and North Korea exchange threats over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear testing regime. \u201cWill it be the end of nuclear weapons, or will it be the end of us?\u201d the Ican head, Beatrice Fihn, said in Oslo after receiving the peace prize on behalf of the anti-nuclear group. \u201cThe only rational course of action is to cease living under the conditions where our mutual destruction is only one impulsive tantrum away,\u201d Fihn said. \u201c[Nuclear weapons] are a madman\u2019s gun held permanently to our temple.\u201d Tensions on the Korean peninsula have escalated as Pyongyang has ramped up its missile and nuclear tests, and the accompanying political rhetoric has grown increasingly bombastic: North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un taunted Donald Trump as a \u201cdotard\u201d, while the US president dubbed his rival \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and a \u201csick puppy\u201d. Ican led the campaign for a global treaty banning nuclear weapons that resulted in a UN treaty being adopted in July this year, under which states committed to never \u201cdevelop, test, produce, manufacture, otherwise acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons\u201d. One hundred and twenty-three countries voted for the treaty at the UN general assembly in July. So far, 56 countries have signed up to it and three have ratified it. The ban treaty will come into force when 50 countries have signed and ratified it. Ican was established in Melbourne in 2007. Its founding chair, Dr Tilman Ruff, associate professor at the Nossal institute for global health at the University of Melbourne, said in Oslo the Nobel was recognition for the millions of campaigners who had worked over decades for the abolition of nuclear weapons. \u201cThat particularly includes the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \u2013 the hibakusha \u2013 and victims of nuclear test explosions, including in Australia and the Pacific, whose painful personal testimonies have played such a crucial role.\u201d Australia has not supported nor signed the treaty. But Ruff \u2013 who was also a member of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War when that organisation won the peace prize in 1985 for its work highlighting the catastrophic health consequences of atomic war \u2013 urged Australia to follow the lead of New Zealand, Indonesia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific and sign and ratify the accord. \u201cNuclear weapons pose an existential threat in any hands and the risks of nuclear war are as high now as they have ever been. \u201cYet the current Australian government has done all it can to get in the way of efforts to end this existential threat to humanity.\u201d The Australian government has maintained a longstanding opposition to a nuclear weapons ban treaty. As a key plank of its foreign policy, Australia has consistently maintained that, as long as nuclear weapons exist, it must rely on the protection of the extended deterrent effect of the US\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the second largest in the world. Australia was a key agitator in preliminary meetings in trying to get the resolution establishing treaty negotiations defeated. But the push for a treaty won massive global support, with 123 nations voting in favour, 38 opposing and 16 abstaining. Australia joined the nuclear weapons states Russia, the US, Israel, France and the UK to vote against the resolution. China abstained. The treaty will not offer a practical path to effective disarmament or enhanced security, a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman told the Guardian during negotiations. \u201cAustralia regards the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons as the cornerstone of global non-proliferation and disarmament efforts.\u201d But the nuclear ban treaty has widespread community \u2013 and growing political \u2013 support. A September poll by ReachTel found 73% of Australians support the ban on nuclear weapons and believe nuclear weapons pose a threat to global security. Seventy-three parliamentarians \u2013 including 60 members of the Labor party, eight Greens, one Liberal and one National \u2013 have signed Ican\u2019s global parliamentary pledge, which commits parliamentarians \u201cto work for the signature and ratification of this landmark treaty by our respective countries\u201d. \u201cWe consider the abolition of nuclear weapons to be a global public good of the highest order and an essential step to promote the security and well-being of all peoples,\u201d the pledge says. The nuclear ban treaty is supported by the majority of the nations on earth but it has no backing from the nine known nuclear states \u2013 the US, China, France, Britain, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea \u2013 which include the veto-wielding permanent five members of the security council. Critics argue that a treaty cannot succeed without the participation of the states that possess nuclear weapons. But proponents say a nuclear weapons ban will create moral suasion \u2013 in the vein of the cluster weapons ban and landmine conventions \u2013 for nuclear weapons states to disarm and establish an international norm prohibiting the development, possession and use of nuclear weapons. Non-nuclear states have expressed increasing frustration with the sclerotic movement towards disarmament. With nuclear weapons states modernising and in some cases increasing their arsenals, instead of discarding them, more states are becoming disenchanted with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and lending their support for an outright ban.",
