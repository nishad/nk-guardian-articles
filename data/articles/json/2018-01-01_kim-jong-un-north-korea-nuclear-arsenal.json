    "content": "North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, has warned the United States his country\u2019s nuclear forces are now \u201ccompleted\u201d, adding that the nuclear launch button was always within easy reach. While he remained defiant in his confrontation with Donald Trump, he struck a more conciliatory note on relations with South Korea, offering to start talks on sending a North Korean delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. After a year in which he ordered a string of missile launches \u2013 including three intercontinental ballistic missiles \u2013 and the regime\u2019s sixth and most powerful nuclear test, Kim used his annual New Year\u2019s Day address to declare the North\u2019s nuclear weapons capability a reality. \u201cWe achieved the goal of completing our state nuclear force in 2017,\u201d Kim said in a speech broadcast live by state TV. \u201cWe need to mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and accelerate their deployment. \u201cThe US should know that the button for nuclear weapons is on my desk. This is not blackmail but reality.\u201d Dressed in a western-style grey suit and tie, Kim added, however, that the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal played a purely deterrent role. \u201cThe entire area of the US mainland is within our nuclear strike range,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US can never start a war against me and our country. These weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.\u201d Asked about Kim\u2019s claim that he has a nuclear button on his desk, and that the weapons can reach the US, Donald Trump said from his New Year\u2019s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago: \u201cWe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see.\u201d Kim said North Korean athletes could participate in the Winter Olympics, which open in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang next month. South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, has encouraged Pyongyang to send a delegation to the Games, hoping their presence would help ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. Kim said: \u201cThe Winter Olympic games that will be held soon in the South will be a good opportunity to display the status of the Korean nation, and we sincerely wish that the event will be held with good results. \u201cWe are prepared to take various steps, including the dispatch of a delegation.\u201d The Winter Olympics will be held from 9-25 February, followed by the Paralympics from 9-18 March.",
