    "content": "Have all North Korean students been required to get Kim Jong-un\u2019s haircut? Not likely, say reports from the ground. Did Kim Jong-un order an enemy of the state to be executed by flamethrower? There\u2019s no solid confirmation. Was Kim Jong-un\u2019s wife killed? Claims appeared one day and then she appeared in video footage a day later. NK News, a Guardian network partner, has said that rumours based on anonymous sources lead to \u201can echo-chamber effect\u201d in a mainstream media hungry for information. We want you to help us turn this on its head. Do you have a myth you\u2019d like us to try and debunk? Or a burning question you\u2019ve always wanted to ask? Fill in your details in the form below and we\u2019ll consult our expert network to get them answered.",
