    "content": "A team of six male and six female weightlifters will return to North Korea this week expecting a hero\u2019s welcome after securing the greatest sporting triumph in the country\u2019s history. North Korea has never headed a medals table in any sport, at any major championships. But its strongmen and women are set to do just that at the International Weightlifting Federation championships being held in Kazakhstan. The team won their 11th and 12th gold medals on Saturday and \u2013 barring a series of freak results in the final two events on Sunday \u2013 they will not be overtaken. \u201cThe Great Leader likes all kinds of sports, and especially weightlifting,\u201d said a team official of the country\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un. After the Asian Games, which were held in South Korea in September and October, North Korea\u2019s team flew home to a huge welcome, having achieved their best results since 1990. KCNA, the official North Korean news agency, said hundreds of thousands of people lined the six-mile route into the city centre and \u201cthe streets turned into a sea of flowers\u201d. Can the weightlifting team expect the same? \u201cI think so,\u201d said the beaming team official, also called Kim [he declined to give his full name]. \u201cKorea has never been first in a sports championships before.\u201d He explained that Kim Jong-un, who spoke recently of \u201ca hot wind of sports blowing through Korea\u201d, first watched weightlifting in the autumn of 2013 at the historic Asian Interclub Cup. It was historic because, for the first time, a South Korean sports team competed north of the border, and were allowed to march under their flag and play their anthem. \u201cThe Leader said our weightlifting was very strong, and he enjoyed it,\u201d said Kim. \u201cWe have about 900 weightlifters, very good coaches, very good facilities.\u201d China, which has dominated weightlifting for years, has 10,000 competitive lifters. Nothing pleases the Koreans more than beating China, which they did yet again on Saturday in the women\u2019s heavyweight (75kg) class. The champion, Kim Un-ju, gave the standard North Korean response to questions afterwards when she said: \u201cMy personal medal does not matter to me, it is only important as part of the team effort. I am so happy to bring home the medal for my people and my Great Leader.\u201d Other North Koreans have been more effusive, though \u2013 surprisingly so. On Friday the 20-year-old Un Hui-ryo, who won the women\u2019s 69kg, said: \u201cThere was a time when China was the strongest in weightlifting, but not anymore. That\u2019s in the past!\u201d North Korea have the world\u2019s best lifter, pound-for-pound, in the form of the phenomenal, jockey-sized Om Yunchol, who competes in the lightest men\u2019s category, 56kg. Om lifted more than three times his own bodyweight \u2013 a feat achieved by only five men in the sport\u2019s history \u2013 to win Olympic and Asian Games gold, and he did it again in Almaty last week. Afterwards he said: \u201cIn the 2012 Olympics I beat Mr Wu [Jingbiao] from China and in 2013 I beat Mr Long [Quingquan] from China. \u201cChina is such a big country, it has so many weightlifters, so many opportunities to win, and we are a much smaller country. But I have beaten them and I will beat them again.\u201d Both Om and the 62kg men\u2019s champion, Kim Un-guk, spoke of their fondness for Korean food \u2013 \u201ctraditional Korean dishes only, kimchi [fermented vegetables] and cold noodles\u201d \u2013 and others have talked of their hobbies. Mostly though, they just train hard. Lyn Jones, a coach with the Australia team who has been in weightlifting for 60 years as a lifter, coach, official and big-event announcer, said: \u201cThey have always had one or two good lifters over the years but never a whole team like this. It\u2019s quite remarkable, and the thing is nobody really knows how they have achieved it. Virtually nobody goes there, and they haven\u2019t used foreign coaches. Even China did that years ago.\u201d Many within the sport say the results must have been helped by doping, but no North Koreans have failed a test. The 2008 Olympic heavyweight champion was in the audience yesterday. Jang Mi-ran, from South Korea, cheered the North Korean lifters and said their success was easy to explain. \u201cThey train, they train some more, and they train again.\u201d Having seen off China, the North Koreans have another superpower in their sights. Next year\u2019s World Championships \u2013 \u201cWe will be there, oh yes,\u201d said Kim \u2013 are in the United States.",
