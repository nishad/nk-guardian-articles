Kim Dae-jung (KDJ): I slept well. I even had naengmyon [cold noodles] at Okryugwan restaurant. KJI: I hope you weren't rushed at lunch. You won't be able to fully appreciate the taste of naegnmyon if you hurry. KDJ: I thank you for your warm welcome. I am sure the people in the South were surprised to see you come to greet me at the airport. KJI: Some Europeans have wondered why I am so reclusive. I am not such a great figure worthy to be called a recluse. The fact is I have made many secret trips to countries like China and Indonesia. How is it that people say I made a rare appearance to welcome you? I have been here and there without people knowing. Is the food to your liking? KDJ: The food is delicious.",
