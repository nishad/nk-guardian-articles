    "content": "In test blasts, military parades and propaganda videos that show San Francisco and Washington DC in ruins, North Korea has broadcast its intention to be a world nuclear power. Less clear, experts say, is how close the secretive nation is to realizing its ambitions to threaten the mainland of the United States. As rhetoric between the two nations has ratcheted up in recent weeks, residents of major west coast cities such as San Francisco, Portland and Seattle have begun to ask out loud: should they be worried? After five nuclear tests in a decade, North Korea has already shown that it poses a nuclear threat to South Korea and Japan, roughly 80,000 American soldiers stationed in those countries, and to China, its nominal ally. But although Kim Jong-un has dramatically increased missile testing since he took power in 2011, North Korea has yet to test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could cross nearly 5,500 miles of the Pacific. North Korea would need to overcome two feats of engineering to threaten the American mainland: a working ICBM system and a warhead for one of those missiles. Unlike shorter-range missiles, long-range missiles have multiple engines and flight stages, meaning North Korean engineers have to make rockets \u2013 and bombs \u2013 that can survive the violent vibrations of launch, the wrenching g-forces of flight, and the temperature changes of takeoff and re-entry from space. \u201cProducing a warhead that can handle all that is a challenge,\u201d said Joseph Bermudez, an analyst for 38 North, a thinktank affiliated with the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Kim has said he wants to test an ICBM later this year, Bermudez doubted the test would be a success. In February, North Korea fired a medium-range missileinto the Sea of Japan, travelling about 300 miles. North Korea has also developed a missile with an estimated range of 2,200 miles, almost halfway to Hawaii, but so far struggled to launch it. Until North Korea begins ICBM tests, it will be difficult to gauge the country\u2019s capabilities, said Joshua Pollack, a senior researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California. \u201cIf they do get to the point where they decide to start a campaign of ICBM flight testing, that will allow them to work through the usual technical difficulties,\u201d he said, noting that they had an \u201cimpressive\u201d record of solving problems. \u201cIt will allow them in time, I\u2019m confident, to create a reliable weapon.\u201d But Pollack was wary about any timeline. \u201cThey could flight test an ICBM today and it could work or it could take them a year or two,\u201d he said. \u201cI really hesitate to say anything about it.\u201d Other experts have offered cautious estimates, based on the rate of testing in the last six years. \u201cIf everything proceeds as is, it\u2019s likely by 2020 that they could have a system reaching the United States,\u201d Bermudez said. \u201cIt should be viewed as an emerging threat.\u201d After the fifth test last fall, Siegfried Hecker, the former director of Los Alamos National Lab, the cradle of the first atomic bomb, gave a similar assessment. \u201cLeft unchecked, Pyongyang will likely develop the capability to reach the continental United States with a nuclear tipped missile in a decade or so,\u201d he wrote in a post for 38 North. While North Korea cannot hide its missile tests \u2013 even short-range tests are usually visible to satellites \u2013 it has performed nuclear tests in a tunnel system beneath a mile-high mountain. The secrecy means experts know relatively little about how small or sophisticated North Korea\u2019s bombs are, or how many exist. Experts agreed, however, that North Korea probably has the means to fit a warhead to an ICBM. \u201cIt\u2019s within the range of their technical capabilities and competence,\u201d Bermudez said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they could easily or successfully do it.\u201d The US has reportedly made it more difficult for North Korea to get missiles off the ground, with a series of cyber-attacks begun by Barack Obama. But government hackers alone probably cannot stop North Korea\u2019s ambitions, Bermudez said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that any cyberwarfare campaign would not be able to stop either the nuclear program or the ballistic program, only delay it.\u201d Donald Trump vowed on Twitter earlier this year that Kim would not test an ICBM, and his advisers have not ruled out pre-emptive military action. Last weekend\u2019s parade, the experts said, showed a natural arc in North Korea\u2019s progress: a mix of propaganda, aspirations and actual progress, to take with a grain of salt. In the parade North Korea showcased two apparently new ICBMs, larger even than existing models already designed to reach the east coast of the US. \u201cThat does not mean it\u2019s ready, that also does not mean it\u2019s fake,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cYou see a mix of old and new, some things not quite ready for primetime, others tried and true.\u201d Hecker and Pollack have urged diplomacy to stall North Korea\u2019s program, saying that Obama\u2019s non-negotiating policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d gave Kim time to develop ICBMs as leverage. \u201cThe good news, if you\u2019re worried, is first of all the North Koreans are not suicidal, they\u2019re not going to just start a war,\u201d Pollack said, noting that the US had coexisted for decades with other nuclear rivals, Russia and China. \u201cSo this is a familiar condition for us and I don\u2019t think we need to get too worked up.\u201d",
