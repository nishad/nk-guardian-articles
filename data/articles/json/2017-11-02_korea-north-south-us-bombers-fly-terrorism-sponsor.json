    "content": "Two American B-1B bombers flew through South Korean airspace and over the country\u2019s Pilsung Range on the latest exercise there, the US air force said on Thursday. North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency claimed that the planes carried out bombing drills simulating attacks on major targets in the country. Although the bombers are no longer part of the US nuclear force, they can be loaded with large numbers of conventional weapons. But the US air force said: \u201cThe bilateral continuous bomber presence (CBP) mission was planned in advance \u2026 and was not in response to any current event.\u201d Japanese and South Korean fighter jets carried out a sequenced mission with the Guam-based US bombers on the eve of Donald Trump\u2019s 12-day trip to Asia, during which North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile weapons threat will top the agenda. On Thursday HR McMaster, the president\u2019s national security adviser, said North Korea could be returned to the list of countries the US believes sponsor terrorism. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear more about that soon, I think,\u201d McMaster told reporters at a press briefing ahead of Trump\u2019s five-country tour that includes meetings with the leaders of Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. McMaster cited the killing in a Malaysian airport earlier this year of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un as an act of terrorism that could lead to the North being returned to a list that currently includes only Iran, Sudan and Syria. Kim Jong-nam died in February after two women rubbed his face with a liquid later identified as VX nerve agent as he passed through the airport in Kuala Lumpur. \u201cA regime who murders someone in a public airport using nerve agent, and a despotic leader who murders his brother in that manner, I mean, that\u2019s clearly an act of terrorism that fits in with a range of other actions,\u201d the national security adviser said. Returning North Korea to the list of state sponsors of terrorism \u201cis something that\u2019s under consideration\u201d, he added. The US kept North Korea on its terrorism blacklist for two decades after the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed 115 people. But President George W Bush \u2013 who once included the country in his \u201caxis of evil\u201d along with Iran and Iraq \u2013 lifted the designation in 2008 to smooth the way for aid-for-disarmament negotiations. Under legislation enacted on 2 August, the state department is required to determine within 90 days, or around Thursday, whether North Korea meets the criteria for being designated as a state sponsor of terrorism \u2013 a largely symbolic move. Tensions between the countries continue to escalate. In a recent speech at the United Nations, Trump said he would \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if necessary and derided Kim as \u201clittle Rocket Man\u201d. McMaster said the president would not alter his tone against North Korea while on tour and claimed his strong rhetoric has been reassuring to allies. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president really modulates his language. Have you noticed him do that? I mean, he\u2019s been very clear about it. I\u2019ve been aware of the discussions about, \u2018Hey, is this inflammatory?\u2019 And what\u2019s inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what they\u2019re doing to threaten the world.\u201d McMaster said a denuclearised Korean peninsula \u201cis the only plausible outcome\u201d and he called on others, including China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s biggest benefactor in the region \u2013 to step up their efforts. \u201cThe president recognises that we\u2019re running out of time and will ask all nations to do more.\u201d",
