    "content": "The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, has urged South Korea to \u201cexercise restraint\u201d in its response to North Korea\u2019s nuclear test, after Seoul resumed the propaganda broadcasts across the border that the regime in Pyongyang regards as an act of war. Speaking during a visit to Japan on Friday, Hammond said he understood why South Korea had retaliated by restarting the broadcasts to coincide with what is thought to be the 33rd birthday of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. \u201cNorth Korea acts in a totally provocative and irresponsible way, so I can understand the pressure South Korea is under to respond,\u201d Hammond told reporters aboard the US aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan at Yokosuka naval base, south of Tokyo. But he added: \u201cWe have to be bigger than the North Koreans and urge South Korea and other like-minded countries in the region to exercise restraint. \u201cWe know that responding in this way is rising to the bait. But if we are going to ask the South Koreans to exercise restraint, we need to be ensure the international community is prepared to take action to address this challenge. \u201cContinuing with words is not enough, we have to show we are prepared to take actions to ensure sanctions against North Korea are effective.\u201d The US navy, meanwhile, said it was increasingly worried about tensions on the Korean peninsula after Pyongyang\u2019s test of a nuclear device on Wednesday, a move that could spur closer military ties between neighbours South Korea and Japan, a senior US officer said on Friday. \u201cA huge explosion occurred, and that should make all countries concerned,\u201d Vice-admiral Joseph Aucoin, commander of the US seventh fleet, said aboard the Ronald Reagan. He said the seventh fleet stood ready to support US forces in South Korea if necessary. \u201cWe want [the North Koreans] to abandon any nuclear activities and comply with the international commitments and obligations. Until they do that they\u2019re not going to achieve prosperity, they\u2019re not going to achieve the security they desire. They\u2019re going to live in isolation,\u201d Aucoin said. The unification ministry in Seoul said there had been no government decision on what North Korea needed to do to end the broadcasts, which began at noon local time (3am GMT/2pm AEDT) on Friday. But they are certain to draw a furious response from North Korea, which considers them a declaration of war because it is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of the authoritarian leadership of Kim. South Korean media reported that troops positioned near 11 loudspeakers sending out the propaganda broadcasts had been put on high alert in case of retaliation by the North. \u201cIf North Korea attacks the loudspeakers, we will immediately retaliate,\u201d Yonhap news agency quoted a defence ministry official in Seoul as saying. The high-decibel broadcasts across the demilitarised zone \u2013 a 4km-wide stretch of land separating the two Koreas \u2013 have been a source of tension in the past. When South Korea briefly resumed propaganda broadcasts in August after an 11-year break, the two Koreas ended up threatening each other with attacks that brought them to the brink of war. In the past, the broadcasts typically blared messages about alleged North Korean government mismanagement, human rights abuses and the superiority of South Korean-style democracy, as well as world news, weather forecasts and K-pop. Irritation at China\u2019s apparent inability to rein in North Korea was in evidence on Thursday, when the US secretary of state, John Kerry, called on Beijing to end its \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach towards Pyongyang. In a phone call with the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, Kerry said China\u2019s economic and diplomatic support for the North \u2013 although it has condemned recent nuclear tests \u2013 had failed. \u201cChina had a particular approach that it wanted to make, that we agreed and respected to give them space to implement that,\u201d Kerry told reporters. \u201cToday in my conversation with the Chinese I made it very clear that has not worked and we cannot continue business as usual.\u201d China bought 90% of North Korea\u2019s exports in 2013, according to data compiled by South Korea\u2019s International Trade Association. Asked to respond to Kerry\u2019s criticism of Beijing, Hammond said he believed China was \u201csincere in its desire not to see North Korea build a nuclear capability\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s true that the efforts so far to contain North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions have succeeded in slowing it down, but not yet in halting it. We do need to do more, and as I think John Kerry is suggesting, we need to ask all members of the international community signed up to the UN do more to ensure enforcement and maximum pressure is placed on North Korea.\u201d China\u2019s diplomatic approach towards Pyongyang has long been dictated by fears that a collapse of the North Korean regime could lead to a unified Korea, with US and allied Korean troops ranged along its border. South Korea said on Friday it was not yet considering shutting down the Kaesong industrial complex, run jointly with North Korea, located north of the rivals\u2019 border. But its military has heightened its cybersecurity alert level, according to Yonhap, which reported on Friday that the military had increased its deployment of cyber-defence agents. The US president, Barack Obama, spoke to the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on Thursday and reaffirmed the \u201cunshakeable US commitment\u201d to their security. The White House said Obama and the two Asian leaders \u201cagreed to work together to forge a united and strong international response to North Korea\u2019s latest reckless behaviour\u201d. South Korean and US military leaders also discussed the deployment of US \u201cstrategic assets\u201d in the wake of the North\u2019s test, Seoul\u2019s defence ministry said. Ministry officials refused to elaborate on what US military assets were under consideration, but it was likely to mean B-52 bombers, F-22 stealth fighters and nuclear-powered submarines. Previously tense relations between Japan and South Korea have improved recently, notably with a landmark agreement seeking to end tensions over the issue of Korean women and girls forced to work in wartime Japanese military brothels. The US government and weapons experts have voiced doubts about whether the device tested by North Korea on Wednesday was a hydrogen bomb, as Pyongyang claimed. South Korea\u2019s spy service said it thought the estimated explosive yield from the blast was much smaller than what even a failed hydrogen bomb detonation would produce. US aircraft designed to detect evidence of a nuclear test, such as radioactive particulate matter and blast-related noble gases, could be deployed from a base on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Japanese media said Tokyo mobilised its own reconnaissance aircraft over the Sea of Japan to try to collect atmospheric data. Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report",
