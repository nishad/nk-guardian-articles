    "content": "Rex Tillerson worked on Sunday to reinforce the basic lines of US policy on major international issues such as Iran and North Korea, all while having to combat perceptions that his relationship with Donald Trump has deteriorated to the point the president is, in the words of one Republican senator, \u201ccastrating\u201d his secretary of state. Appearing on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Tillerson said the US wished to remain in the Iran nuclear deal and denied that China was confused about its North Korea policy. Diplomatic manoeuvres would continue over the latter issue, he said, \u201cuntil the first bomb drops\u201d. The secretary of state also denied he had, in interviewer Jake Tapper\u2019s formulation of a suggestion first made by the Tennessee senator Bob Corker, been \u201cgelded\u201d. \u201cI checked, I\u2019m fully intact,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cThis is a very unique president,\u201d said Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil chief, commenting on a crescendo of rumors about his relationship with Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that everyone sees him as the most unique president in modern history.\u201d Tillerson declined repeatedly to deny reports he called Trump a \u201cmoron\u201d \u2013 in some versions, a \u201cfucking moron\u201d. Tension between the two men broke into full display at the start of this month when the president tweeted that Tillerson was \u201cwasting his time\u201d in trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Tillerson then gave a press conference in which he touted his loyalty to Trump, but refused to confirm or deny that he had called him a moron. He reiterated that position with Tapper. \u201cI\u2019m not playing,\u201d Tillerson said, after Tapper asked about the alleged \u201cmoron\u201d comment. \u201cThese are the games of Washington. These are the destructive games of this town. I\u2019m not dignifying the question with an answer, Jake, and I\u2019m a little surprised that you want to spend so much time on it when there are so many issues around the world.\u201d Tillerson sought to shore up perceptions that the US remains committed to the Iran nuclear deal. On Friday, Trump said he would not certify Iranian compliance with the deal and threatened to withdraw. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we cannot address the flaws within the [Iran] agreement by staying within the agreement, working with the other signatories,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cWe want to take the agreement as it exists, fully enforce that agreement.\u201d Trump made a major break with past US policy by declining to certify a deal negotiated by the Barack Obama administration. He stopped short of saying it was off, but he threatened to do so. \u201cIn the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,\u201d he said. Tillerson sought to soften that line, downplaying the notion the US was on the way out. The Iranians had committed technical violations of the agreement, he said, but had \u201cremedied the violations, which brings them back into technical compliance\u201d. \u201cOur response to that has been to work with the other parties and demand that we see much more in enforcement,\u201d he said. Even as Tillerson split with Trump on the issue, however, United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley floated a different explanation of the administration\u2019s Iran strategy. Haley told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press the US was reviewing the Iran deal not owing to noncompliance but as a result of tensions with North Korea. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying now with Iran is don\u2019t let it become the next North Korea,\u201d she said. The secretary of state denied that mixed messages from the Trump administration risked sowing confusion abroad. Hillary Clinton had warned in an interview recorded earlier this week and broadcast on Sunday that the administration was risking a \u201cnuclear arms race\u201d by sowing confusion on Iran and North Korea. \u201cRest assured the Chinese are not confused in any way about the American policy in North Korea,\u201d Tillerson said. Trump\u2019s tweets notwithstanding, he said the US was committed to a diplomatic solution. \u201cI want to make it clear that the president has made it clear to me he wants to solve this diplomatically \u2026 he is not seeking to go to war,\u201d he said. \u201cThe diplomatic effort will continue until the first bomb drops.\u201d The risk of an escalation in any conflict on the peninsula involving China was ameliorated by an open line of communication between Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping, Tillerson said. \u201cFortunately, President Trump and President Xi probably have one of the closest relationships the president has with any head of state,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president speaks to President Xi on the telephone frequently, I think they\u2019ve had seven or eight calls.\u201d The possibility of Tillerson\u2019s resignation or firing, much discussed in recent weeks with reference to Haley as a possible replacement, was not broached.",
