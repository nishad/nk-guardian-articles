    "content": "Kim Jong-un has called the new accord between North and South Korea \u201ca landmark occasion\u201d that paves the way for defused military tension and improved ties, while claiming it was the strength of the North\u2019s armed forces and its nuclear arms that gave it bargaining power. At the same time, the North Korean media announced Kim had sacked several top officials of the country\u2019s Central Military Commission. Pyongyang gave no reasons for the dismissals but analysts said it could be linked to landmine explosions that maimed South Korean soldiers within the demilitarised zone along their heavily fortified border. The South blamed the North but Kim\u2019s regime officially denied it. As tensions mounted the rival countries exchanged artillery fire and threatened further strikes against each other, while Seoul resumed propaganda broadcasts critical of Kim\u2019s authoritarian rule. The two sides on Tuesday agreed to end the standoff and open a new channel of dialogue with the aim of improving ties. On Friday official media quoted Kim as saying: \u201cThe joint press release published at the contact provided a crucial landmark occasion of defusing the acute military tension and putting the catastrophic inter-Korean relations on the track of reconciliation and trust \u2026 thanks to the tremendous military muscle with the nuclear deterrent for self-defence built by the great party as a pivot and matchless ranks single-mindedly united around the party.\u201d On Friday the South\u2019s unification ministry said the Red Cross had sent a message to the North proposing talks in the border village of Panmunjom on 7 September to discuss reunions of separated families. Tuesday\u2019s accord included a pact to hold reunions of families split during the 1950-53 Korean War, many of whom are ageing and hoping to see lost family members for the last time. During a party meeting Kim also ordered soldiers to help a recently flooded city, a sign of his need to show his people he cares about a decrepit economy. With Reuters, AP and AFP",
