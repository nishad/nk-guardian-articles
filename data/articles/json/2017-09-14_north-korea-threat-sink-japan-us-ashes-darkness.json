    "content": "North Korea has threatened to sink Japan and said the US should be \u201cbeaten to death like a rabid dog\u201d after the two countries spearheaded fresh UN security council sanctions in response to the regime\u2019s recent nuclear test. The Korea Asia-Pacific peace committee, which oversees North Korea\u2019s relations with the outside world, described the UN security council, which passed a new round of sanctions on Monday, as a \u201ctool of evil\u201d in the pay of Washington, and called for it to be broken up. It is the first time that Pyongyang has issued an explicit threat to Japan since it fired a medium-range ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido at the end of last month, triggering emergency sirens and mass text alerts. \u201cThe four islands of the [Japanese] archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche,\u201d the committee said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. Juche is the ideology of self-reliance pioneered by Kim Il-sung, the country\u2019s founder and grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong-un. \u201cJapan is no longer needed to exist near us,\u201d the committee added. The 15-member security council voted unanimously in support of a US-drafted resolution condemning the missile test and imposing measures that include a ban on North Korean textile imports and restrictions on oil exports to the country. In response, the committee said the US should be \u201cbeaten to death like a rabid dog\u201d for the \u201cheinous sanctions resolution\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s reduce the US mainland into ashes and darkness. Let\u2019s vent our spite with mobilisation of all retaliation means which have been prepared till now,\u201d it said. Japan\u2019s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, described the statement as \u201cextremely provocative and egregious\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is something that markedly heightens regional tension and is absolutely unacceptable.\u201d A new report has claimed that the detonation on 3 September of what North Korea claimed was a hydrogen bomb involved a device with an estimated yield of 250 kilotons \u2013 making it far more powerful than initially thought. The US-based 38 North website noted that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation had revised upwards the seismic power created by the test from magnitude 5.8 to 6.1. It added: \u201cThis revision is significant because, rather than providing an equivalent yield of about 120 kilotons derived from the lower magnitude estimates, the application of standard formula with appropriate constants shows that the yield can now be estimated to have been roughly 250 kilotons (one quarter megaton). \u201cRegardless of whether this most recent test was an operational warhead for an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] or simply a device, the yield of the test clearly shows North Korean progress in increasing the yields of their nuclear weapons.\u201d After weeks of heightened tensions and threats emanating from Pyongyang and Washington, there are signs that US and other officials may be attempting to engage the regime diplomatically. Japan\u2019s public broadcaster NHK claimed on Thursday that US and North Korean officials had met \u201csecretly\u201d on the sidelines of a security forum in Switzerland earlier this month. The report did not offer details, but said that Choe Kang-il, deputy director general for North American affairs at the North Korean foreign ministry, and Evans Revere, a former senior official at the state department, had raised North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear tests. While Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has refused to consider negotiations unless Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons programme, an MP has claimed that support is rising inside the governing Liberal Democratic party for possible engagement with the regime. Antonio Inoki, a former professional wrestler, said he had spoken to several unnamed LDP MPs who supported sending a delegation of Japanese parliamentarians to Pyongyang in an attempt to defuse tensions. \u201cWe are seeing a situation where [Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un] is raising his fist, and the situation is escalating,\u201d said Inoki, who met North Korea\u2019s top diplomat, Ri Su-yong, and other officials during a trip to Pyongyang last week. \u201cIt\u2019s important to see who can be the first to lower his fist and reduce tensions.\u201d The 74-year-old, who has visited North Korea 32 times, said LDP lawmakers had become more receptive to the idea of dialogue. \u201cThe political wind has changed direction,\u201d he said, adding that North Korean officials were receptive to the idea. \u201cI made a proposal and was told they would be happy to receive such a delegation.\u201d In another gesture apparently aimed at lowering the diplomatic temperature, South Korea\u2019s government is considering an $8m (\u00a36m) aid package for North Korea. Seoul suspended aid to North Korea, provided via UN agencies, after the regime conducted nuclear and missile tests in 2016. But under a proposal that could be approved next week, the South would provide $4.5m to a World Food Programme project to help infants and pregnant women, and $3.5m to Unicef, according to Yonhap news agency. \u201cThe government\u2019s basic stance is that humanitarian assistance to those who are vulnerable in North Korea should be continued regardless of political considerations,\u201d Yonhap quoted a unification ministry official in Seoul as saying. \u201cSeoul plans to decide the details of the aid and its timing after taking into account the inter-Korean situation,\u201d he added.",
