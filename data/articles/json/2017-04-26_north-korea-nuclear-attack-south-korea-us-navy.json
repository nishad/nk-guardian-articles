    "content": "The US admiral in charge of a potential conflict with North Korea has said his goal is to bring Kim Jong-un \u201cto his senses, not to his knees\u201d, as the Trump administration signaled it intends to use economic and diplomatic pressure to denuclearize the peninsula. Tensions between the US and North Korea are white-hot ahead of an anticipated sixth nuclear test from Pyongyang and its accelerating long-range missile development. Donald Trump invited the entire US Senate to the White House on Wednesday afternoon for an unusual classified briefing on the situation. But the Trump administration struggled to explain any new strategy to rein in Kim Jong-un \u2013 just a week after the vice-president, Mike Pence, said that the \u201cera of strategic patience is over\u201d. Adm Harry Harris, the commander of US Pacific Command (Pacom), sounded dire notes before a congressional panel on Wednesday, testifying that he did not have confidence that North Korea would refrain from \u201csomething precipitous\u201d should it succeed in miniaturizing a nuclear weapon to mount on a ballistic missile. While Harris did not provide any timetable for reaching an \u201cinflection point\u201d in North Korean nuclear capabilities, he suggested that the North\u2019s accelerating missile tests indicated that Pyongyang will at some point be able to launch a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile at the United States unless stopped by an external force, diplomatically or militarily. \u201cJust as Thomas Edison is believed to have failed 1,000 times before successfully inventing the light bulb, so, too, Kim Jong-un will keep trying. One of these days soon, he will succeed,\u201d Harris told the House armed services committee. A joint statement on Wednesday afternoon from secretary of state Rex Tillerson, secretary of defense James Mattis and director of national intelligence Dan Coats declared that \u201cpast efforts have failed\u201d to stop the advance of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. But the three senior officials said that to convince the North to \u201cdismantle\u201d those programs, Trump would pressure Pyongyang \u201cby tightening economic sanctions and pursuing diplomatic measures with our allies and regional partners\u201d \u2013 an approach adopted by the past three US administrations. During the hearing, Harris suggested that Kim Jong-un\u2019s statements indicated that denuclearization \u2013 the goal outlined by the cabinet officials \u2013 is no longer a realistic option: \u201cAs former secretary of defense William Perry once said, we must deal with North Korea \u2018as it is, not as we might wish it to be\u2019.\u201d The statement from the three cabinet officials did not outline any additional military steps. A senior administration official told reporters that the Trump administration is considering returning North Korea to the state department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism, following its removal in 2008. According to the most recent state department report on terrorism, covering 2015, North Korea is not assessed to have committed any acts of terrorism since 1987. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, emerged from the White House\u2019s briefing to say senators \u201cwere not presented with any specific military option\u201d. Coons said a resolution of the \u201cvery difficult\u201d North Korea problem would require \u201cpersistent engaged allocation of diplomatic and military resources and effort\u201d. He said he considered Trump to be developing a \u201cdiplomatic strategy that strikes me as clear-eyed and well proportioned to the threat\u201d. At the White House meeting, Trump pledged a different course on North Korea stemming from his ability to \u201cget things done\u201d, according to a Senate aide. But members of both parties left the meeting concerned that the White House does not \u201chave an effective plan in place and doesn\u2019t understand the level of effort necessary to reach a diplomatic solution\u201d, the aide said. Speaking earlier, Harris indicated a preference for a sizeable show of military force in order to deter North Korea from launching a devastating assault, to include sending the guided-missile submarine USS Michigan to South Korea\u2019s port city of Busan, overflying the Korean peninsula with B-1 and B-52 bombers, and ordering the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group to the waters near Korea. Harris accepted responsibility for \u201cconfusion\u201d stemming from the Vinson deployment, which Trump and the US navy highlighted last week even though the carrier group was still thousands of miles from the peninsula. The Vinson, Harris said, is now in the Philippine Sea, placing its weapons and aircraft within \u201cstriking range\u201d of North Korea. Harris acknowledged that possible reprisals stemming from a strike against North Korea would place at risk the lives of millions of Koreans in Seoul \u2013 as well as the 24,000 US troops in South Korea. \u201cI would say what we\u2019re faced with is that... a lot more Koreans and Japanese and Americans dying if North Korea achieves its nuclear aims and does what [Kim Jong-un] has said it\u2019s going to do,\u201d Harris said. Against the threat of one of the densest concentrations of artillery pieces on earth, aimed at one of the most densely populated areas on earth, Harris said vaguely that the US could \u201caffect North Korea\u2019s military calculus\u201d depending on the sort of pre-emptive strike taken. Harris warned that \u201cfollow-on\u201d measures from any strike would tax US capabilities to sustain a military campaign. He urged Congress to add ballistic-missile interceptors to installations in Alaska and California, and to \u201cstudy\u201d placing interceptors in Hawaii while immediately bolstering defensive radars there. Backing Trump, Harris said China had substantial leverage against North Korea, a treaty ally of Beijing and a primary trade partner, while calling it \u201cpreposterous\u201d that China was pressuring South Korean companies over the looming placement of a powerful US terminal-phase missile defense system known as Thaad. The admiral said the recent summit between Trump and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, reduced the risk of any military conflict escalating to include China. \u201cIt\u2019s early days, but China seems to be helpful here,\u201d Harris said.",
