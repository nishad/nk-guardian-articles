    "content": "An artist may well have invented the internet\u2019s dream: a North Korea meme generator. Inspired by the release of 310 new political propaganda slogans by North Korea last week, Eric Drass, a painter and digital artist based in the UK, has used a mathematical algorithm to randomly generate a new set of political phrases. Like a typical Tweetbot, the program adds the words to a randomly selected picture of Kim Jong-un before tweeting them as @NK_markov. The original statements released by the ruling Worker\u2019s Party of Korea covered everything from green-fingered encouragement: \u201cLet us turn ours into a country of mushrooms!\u201d and \u201cGrow vegetables extensively in greenhouses!\u201d, to orders to celebrate the legacy of the Kim dynasty. On some, the message may have been lost in translation: \u201cGo beyond the cutting edge!\u201d and \u201cPlay sports games in an offensive way!\u201d for example. Drass says he embarked on the project because he is interested in the relationship between the west and North Korea, a country \u201cfar enough away that it seems fair game\u201d. He questions why the totalitarian state is often seen as a source of amusement, despite well-documented human rights abuses, and thinks westerners would not feel as comfortable poking fun at Syrian president Bashar al-Assad or laughing at the eccentricities of Islamic State (Isis). North Korea, he says, has an alien quality about it, from the way the regime communicates with the outside world to the way it\u2019s covered by the global media. He thinks its \u201cbuffoonery makes it a softer target\u201d. \u201cThe fact that Kim Jong-un is the dictator that it\u2019s ok to laugh at is also fascinating,\u201d he says, adding it would be \u201centirely different if I\u2019d chosen Assad or [Robert] Mugabe\u201d. Drass\u2019s argument is perhaps supported by the recent hype surrounding the Hollywood film The Interview \u2013 a comedy about the assassination of a serving world leader. Since its release North Korea has provided the setting for a host of games and apps, almost all using Kim Jong-un as a central figure of fun. To make the bot Drass added the text from all 310 slogans to what\u2019s known as a markov chain generator, which then randomly creates a new sentence every few hours. Time will tell how popular it will be, but he could be onto a good thing. According to Mashable, a picture of Kim Jong-un visiting a tile factory was one of the memes that broke the internet in 2014. Judging by its output so far, Drass\u2019s program is of variable quality. Phrases such as \u201cAdd brilliance to our country and people and gunners!\u201d and \u201cEnhance the principle of self-reliance!\u201d could well be carried by state news agency KCNA. But others such as \u201cRadically improve the officials shoulders\u201d and \u201cJournalists and accurate!\u201d are less convincing.",
