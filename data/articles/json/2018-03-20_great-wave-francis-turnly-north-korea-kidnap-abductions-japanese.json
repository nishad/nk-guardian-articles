    "content": "Sometimes a play grips because of its subject. Such is the case with this new piece by Francis Turnly which, although dramaturgically conventional, opens up the story of the abduction by North Korea of young Japanese citizens. Documentaries and movies have been made about this, but Turnly\u2019s play seems especially timely as we struggle to understand life inside Kim Jong-un\u2019s hermit state. Turnly\u2019s chronological approach spans the years from 1979 to 2003 and covers the mysterious disappearance of a Japanese schoolgirl. The 17-year-old Hanako is young, bolshy and restless. One stormy night, after one of her regular spats with her elder sister, she rushes off to the beach in pursuit of their schoolmate Tetsuo. The rest of the action splits between two locales. In Japan, we see Hanako\u2019s sister, mother and Tetsuo tirelessly seeking to discover what happened to her. In North Korea, we see the captive Hanako being employed to teach a young woman of her own age Japanese language and culture for reasons that gradually become clear. I was strongly reminded of two recent plays at London\u2019s Finborough. As with In-Sook Chappell\u2019s P\u2019yongyang, we glimpse the mixture of veneration and rigidity that characterises North Korea, while the idea that one\u2019s identity can be changed by physical circumstance echoes the theme of Ghassan Kanafani\u2019s Returning to Haifa. But Turnly\u2019s strength lies in his ability to tell a fascinating story and to show how realpolitik intrudes on personal tragedy: if Hanako\u2019s relatives are confronted by stonewalling Tokyo officials in their quest for truth, it is because Japan is desperately anxious not to provoke a nuclear-armed North Korea. Indhu Rubasingham\u2019s production, co-presented with the Tricycle, rightly focuses on swift storytelling and is much aided by Tom Piper\u2019s design of a rotating cube that shifts easily between the two settings. Kirsty Rider captures perfectly Hanako\u2019s enforced assimilation to her new surroundings; there is good work from Rosalind Chao and Kae Alexander as her mother and sister respectively, and Leo Wan impresses as the tenacious Tetsuo, even if his ability to solve the problem of Hanako\u2019s disappearance makes him sound like a Tokyo Sherlock Holmes. Formally, Turnly\u2019s play breaks no new ground but it draws one\u2019s rapt attention to a scandal that long obsessed the people of Japan. At the Dorfman, London, until 14 April. Box office: 020-7452 3000.",
