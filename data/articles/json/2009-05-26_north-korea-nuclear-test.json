    "content": "What do we know about North Korea's nuclear capacity? This is the second time that Pyongyang has detonated a nuclear device; its last test, in October 2006, prompted international condemnation and tough UN sanctions. The key question is North Korea's ability to deliver its devices. Analysts had previously concluded that it could not miniaturise a device enough to mount on to a missile \u2013 but that view is changing. Pyongyang has claimed it has already weaponised enough plutonium for four or five warheads. Mohamed ElBaradei, the International Atomic Energy Agency head, said recently it was a \"matter of fact\" that the country had nuclear weapons. Last month the launch of a rocket by North Korea suggested that its long-range missile technology has improved. But while the Taepodong-2 is theoretically capable of reaching Alaska; it is thought to have managed only a few hundred miles this time and would struggle even more carrying a warhead. How serious a concern is this latest test to the US and regional powers? This test appears to have been considerably more successful than the previous attempt \u2013 one Russian estimate suggested the underground blast could have been 20 times as great, at around 20 kilotonnes. North Korea's state news agency, KCNA, described the test as \"on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology\" \u2013 though it often makes exaggerated claims. Most experts say the greatest concern is technology transfer. In this month's Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Siegfried Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US who gained rare access to North Korea's Yongbyon reactor, warned that restarting it \"may embolden Pyongyang to test another weapon in order to improve its arsenal's sophistication or \u2026 give it an additional incentive to link with Iran in a troublesome alliance of nuclear and missile technology cooperation.\" What is the aim of this latest test? Not just improving its technology. Xu Guangyu, of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told Reuters: \"North Korea's strategic objective has not changed. That objective is to win the attention of the Obama administration, to push the North Korea issue up the agenda.\" A former South Korean foreign minister, Han Seung-joo, added: \"It's one way of breaking in the new US administration to the North Korean way of doing things \u2026 If and when negotiations take place with the US, they want to make it into disarmament or arms control talks between nuclear weapons states, which assumes the US recognises or at least reckons North Korea as a weapons state.\" What can be done now? Despite moves last night towards a new resolution, most analysts say the UN security council can do little more than condemn the test and tighten existing sanctions since Russia and China are unlikely to accept new measures. \"This time we will likely get a stronger response than [to the] rocket launch since there is no ambiguity ... but whether the council will have any tools to use is another question. Against North Korea, it seems highly unlikely,\" Tim Savage, deputy director of the Nautilus Institute, told Reuters. How is China reacting? North Korea's key ally said it was \"resolutely opposed\" to the test, urging its neighbour to avoid actions which would increase tensions. China rarely criticises Pyongyang publicly, but a foreign ministry statement, which said the North had acted in defiance of the international community and its own commitments, was considerably more muted than the response to the 2006 test, when Beijing accused Pyongyang of a \"flagrant and brazen\" violation of global opinion. \"China's goal is to ensure that the six-party talks process does not fall apart,\" said Xu.",
