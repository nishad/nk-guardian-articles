    "content": "North Korea claims the US mainland is now within range of its missiles after it successfully test-fired a new rocket it says is capable of carrying a \u201clarge-scale, heavy nuclear warhead\u201d. Sunday morning\u2019s launch of a mid- to long-range ballistic missile was overseen by the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, who accused the US of \u201cbrowbeating\u201d countries that \u201chave no nukes\u201d. He warned Washington not to misjudge the reality that the US mainland is in Pyongyang\u2019s \u201csighting range for [a] strike\u201d, the KCNA state news agency reported. KCNA said the missile was a new ground-to-ground Hwasong-12 capable of carrying a large-size heavy nuclear warhead. Kim reportedly \u201chugged officials in the field of rocket research, saying that they worked hard to achieve a great thing\u201d, it added. The missile was launched on an unusually high trajectory to avoid threatening the security of nearby countries. KCNA said it flew to an altitude of 1,312 miles (2,111 km) and travelled 490 miles before landing in the Sea of Japan, near Russia. Most experts are sceptical of North Korean claims that it has missiles that can reach the US mainland, but analysts said the flight data suggested the rocket launched on Sunday could fly at least 2,800 miles if launched at a standard trajectory \u2013 putting the Pacific territory of Guam within range. \u201cThis is the longest-range missile North Korea has ever tested,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in the US, told Agence France-Presse. John Schilling, an aerospace engineering specialist, said on the website of 38 North, a Washington-based monitoring project, that the launch appeared to demonstrate an intermediate-range ballistic missile that could reliably strike the US base at Guam in the Pacific. \u201cMore importantly,\u201d Schilling said, it \u201cmay represent a substantial advance to developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\u201d Schilling said the ability to hit Guam was not a game-changer, but the new missile could be the forerunner to an even more powerful missile. \u201cWhat would change the strategic balance is an ICBM capable of reaching the US mainland,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not that missile but it might be a test bed, demonstrating technologies and systems to be used in future ICBMs.\u201d The Trump administration has warned that a first ICBM test, together with any further nuclear tests, would cross a line that could prompt military retaliation, although the president has also called for the proper application of multilateral sanctions against Pyongyang and even held out the possibility of a summit with Kim \u201cif the conditions are set\u201d. Sunday\u2019s launch is also being interpreted as sending a message to South Korea, days after President Moon Jae-in took office, pledging to engage Pyongyang after declaring a decade of isolation and sanctions under his conservative predecessors a failure. On Monday, South Korea\u2019s unification ministry declined to speculate on its neighbour\u2019s intentions, but warned it not to underestimate the strength of international opposition to its missile tests. \u201c[The international community] has the shared view that North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile provocations pose a grave threat to peace and security in the region and beyond the peninsula,\u201d Lee Duk-haeng, a ministry spokesman, said. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, called on China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s main ally and trading partner \u2013 to increase pressure on the regime to end its missile tests. He said the regime\u2019s conduct was reckless, provocative and unlawful. \u201cThe greatest responsibility for bringing North Korea to its senses \u2026 lies with China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the overwhelming dominant economic relationship with North Korea and because they have the greatest leverage, they have the greatest responsibility.\u201d The US military\u2019s Pacific command said the type of missile fired was \u201cnot consistent with an intercontinental ballistic missile\u201d. KCNA said the launch was designed to verify \u201cthe tactical and technological specifications of the newly developed ballistic rocket capable of carrying a large-size heavy nuclear warhead\u201d. The UN security council is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss the missile launch, diplomats said. The US ambassador to the UN called the launch a message by Pyongyang to South Korea after the election of Moon. Nikki Haley told ABC\u2019s This Week programme: \u201cYou first have to get into Kim Jong-un\u2019s head \u2013 which is, he\u2019s in a state of paranoia, he\u2019s incredibly concerned about anything and everything around him.\u201d She said the missile test had quashed any immediate prospects of Trump holding talks with Kim : \u201cHaving a missile test is not the way to sit down with the president, because he\u2019s absolutely not going to do it.\u201d Haley added that Kim \u201ccan sit there and say all the conditions he wants. Until he meets our conditions, we\u2019re not sitting down with him.\u201d The KCNA report on the missile\u2019s flight was largely consistent with South Korean and Japanese assessments that it flew 435 miles and reached an altitude of more than 1,243 miles, which is further and higher than an intermediate-range missile tested in February from the same region, north-west of Pyongyang.
