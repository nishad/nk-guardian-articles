    "content": "North Korea has said it is still willing to hold direct talks between its leader Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, calling the planned summit \u201cdesperately necessary\u201d to resolve potential hostilities after the US cancelled the meeting. \u201cWe express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the US and resolve issues anytime and in any format,\u201d North Korea\u2019s vice foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan said in a statement. \u201cOur commitment to doing our best for the sake of peace and stability for the world and the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged, and we are open-minded in giving time and opportunity to the US.\u201d North Korea\u2019s response moved to place the blame on the US. It has consistently worked to portray itself as the driver of progress in a relationship that has remained hostile for over six decades. Kim Jong-un has been crafting an image of a responsible statesman against an erratic Trump. \u201cInternally we have been quietly giving president Trump high marks for making a decision no other American president had the courage to pursue,\u201d Kim Kye-gwan said. Trump on Thursday abruptly called off the summit, which was scheduled for 12 June in Singapore, citing \u201ctremendous anger and open hostility\u201d in recent North Korean statements. But Pyongyang said Trump\u2019s \u201cunilateral cancellation of the summit was unexpected and very regrettable\u201d. US officials also complained North Koreans did not show up to preparatory meetings and would not answer calls. During a television appearance, Trump left open the possibility talks could still be held. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the existing summit could take place, or a summit at some later date. Nobody should be anxious. We have to get it right,\u201d he said. \u201cIf and when Kim Jong-un chooses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting.\u201d US allies in Asia were blindsided by the announcement. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, called an emergency meeting just before midnight local time, saying: \u201cI am very perplexed and it is very regrettable that the North Korea-US summit will not be held.\u201d \u201cDenuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace are historic tasks that can neither be abandoned nor delayed,\u201d Moon said. A photo of the meeting released by the presidential office showed Moon with a deep frown. North Korea \u201cremains sincere in ... making efforts on denuclearization and peace building\u201d, said Cho Myoung-gyon, the South\u2019s minister in charge of inter-Korean affairs. Japan\u2019s foreign minister, Taro Kono, said it was \u201cmeaningless to hold a summit if it does not bring about progress\u201d, but added he would continue to support the idea of a Trump-Kim meeting at a later date. \u201cThe important thing is not the meeting itself but that there are opportunities to move towards resolving the nuclear and missile issues,\u201d the chief cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters. John Tierney, executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said: \u201cThe first rule of diplomacy is to always consult your allies, yet our key allies in the region were blindsided by the move. President Trump can blame North Korea\u2019s hostile rhetoric for his decision, but the reality is that the Trump administration had no unified diplomatic strategy from the beginning.\u201d The South vowed to continue dialogue with North Korea on denuclearisation, while foreign ministers from South Korea and the US said they would continue working towards a US-North Korea summit. Mike Pompeo, Washington\u2019s top diplomat, said there was \u201cclear will\u201d to continue dialogue with Pyongyang during his call with his South Korean counterpart, according to Yonhap news agency.",
