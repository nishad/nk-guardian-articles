    "content": "However alarming, North Korea's nuclear boast can hardly be said to defy belief (North Korea's nuclear boast dismays Asia, April 26). As events in Iraq seem to bear out, the only obvious deterrent to a US \"pre-emptive\" strike is to actually have weapons of mass destruction (rather than just be accused of having them) and, more to the point, have them on hot standby. The North Koreans appear to be using their nuclear leverage to extract a \"no first strike\" treaty from the US. Ironically, Bush describes the North Korean tactic as \"blackmail\" and \"intimidation\". But what is the threat of pre-emptive attack and open-ended war, if not a form of blackmail and intimidation?
