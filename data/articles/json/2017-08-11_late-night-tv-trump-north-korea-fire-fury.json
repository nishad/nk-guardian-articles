    "content": "Late-night hosts on Thursday addressed Donald Trump\u2019s press conference at his golf resort in New Jersey, where he doubled down on his threats to North Korea. \u201cBefore we start the show tonight I\u2019d like to go on the record: I do not want the world to blow up,\u201d Stephen Colbert began. \u201cThat\u2019s where my house is. \u201cBut things are getting tense between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un,\u201d he continued. \u201cFor the record, we didn\u2019t start it. North Korea has been testing these missiles for a long time now and saying specifically they\u2019re making them to attack the United States. So obviously a firm response is necessary, but maybe not \u2018fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen\u2019,\u201d he added, referencing Trump\u2019s comments from Tuesday. \u201cI understand wanting to say that,\u201d the host went on. \u201cBut this is like a hostage situation. You don\u2019t start with \u2018go ahead kill everybody, I\u2019ll kill \u2019em better, then who wins?\u2019 \u201cThere is one world leader who actually thinks Donald Trump did not go far enough. And that would be Donald Trump. Because this afternoon, he addressed a nervous world from the steps of the Jersey White House.\u201d Colbert then showed footage of Trump answering questions from the press, repeating that his \u201cfire and fury\u201d statement might not have been \u201ctough enough\u201d. \u201cWhat is tougher than fire and fury?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cLava and rage? A paper cut and a lemon? Rizzoli and Isles? Crate and Barrel? Key and Peele?\u201d Colbert continued: \u201cTo be fair, North Korea isn\u2019t helping in this situation. Today they said they\u2019re drawing up plans to launch four intermediate-range ballistic missiles into waters near Guam. Speaking of which, the president addressed those threats this afternoon.\u201d Trump, at that same press conference, said: \u201cLet\u2019s see what he does with Guam.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not see what he does with Guam,\u201d the host shot back. \u201cYou can\u2019t just offer up a US territory for target practice. It\u2019s filled with people!\u201d Seth Meyers of NBC also weighed in on the president\u2019s escalation of his rhetoric toward the North Korean government, and his advisers\u2019 attempts to talk them back. \u201cAs you recall, tensions with North Korea were simmering at a moderate heat until Trump decided to crank up the burner with this reckless comment on Tuesday,\u201d Meyers began. \u201cAlmost immediately after that comment, the adults around Trump tried to tamp down the rhetoric. First up, secretary of state Rex Tillerson.\u201d Meyers then showed a clip of Tillerson addressing the North Korean threat in more modulated terms, telling the American people they can \u201csleep well tonight\u201d. \u201cSleep well tonight? We haven\u2019t been sleeping well since November,\u201d Meyers responded. \u201cOther Trump aides even went a step further than Tillerson, essentially telling the rest of the world not to take Trump seriously. One aide told a reporter for Politico: \u2018Fire and fury was not carefully vetted language from Trump. Don\u2019t read too much into it.\u2019\u201d Meyers continued: \u201cSo naturally, hearing that some of his aides and advisers might have been trying to tone things down, Trump went back in front of the camera today and doubled down, insisting that his original comment might not have been tough enough. \u201cWhat\u2019s crazy about all of this is that the original comments Trump is now doubling down on were improvised on the spot during a briefing on the opioid crisis,\u201d the host explained. \u201cIn fact, the paper he seemed to be looking at wasn\u2019t even a scripted statement on North Korea. It was a fact sheet on [the opioid] crisis.\u201d Meyers then addressed the president\u2019s comments on the opioid crisis, which displayed his unfamiliarity with the issue. \u201cAnd you can tell Trump was familiar with the facts from the ingenious plan he came up with for stopping the opioid epidemic,\u201d Meyers said. About that epidemic, Trump said: \u201cTalking to youth, telling them no good, really bad for you. If they don\u2019t start, it will never be a problem.\u201d Meyers responded: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want people to start taking drugs, stop making them think the end of the world is imminent.\u201d",
