    "content": "North Korea has threatened to shoot down US bombers in international airspace, claiming that, with a weekend tweet, Donald Trump had declared war. The North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-ho said: \u201cThe whole world should clearly remember it was the US who first declared war on our country.\u201d He referred in particular to Trump\u2019s tweet on Sunday that warned that the regime\u2019s leaders \u201cwon\u2019t be around much longer\u201d. In his first address to the UN last Tuesday, Trump had also warned that if the US and its allies were attacked, he would \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea. Ri said the UN and the international community had hoped that the war of words between the two countries would not turn into \u201creal action\u201d. \u201cHowever, last weekend Trump claimed that our leadership won\u2019t be around much longer, and hence at last he declared war on our country,\u201d Ri said, speaking to journalists through an interpreter outside the UN general assembly in New York. \u201cGiven the fact that this came from someone who holds the seat of the US presidency, this is clearly a declaration of war.\u201d Ri added: \u201cSince the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make counter-measures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not yet inside the airspace border of our country. \u201cThe question of who won\u2019t be around much longer will be answered then. The US denied it had declared war but warned it had military options if North Korea does take further \u201cprovocative\u201d actions. \u201cFrankly, the suggestion of that is absurd,\u201d said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cOur goal is still the same: we continue to seek the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s our focus \u2013 doing that through both the most maximum economic and diplomatic pressures as possible at this point.\u201d Katina Adams, a spokeswoman for the state department, said \u201cThe United States has not \u2018declared war\u2019 on North Korea. We continue to seek a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. No nation has the right to fire on other nations\u2019 aircraft or ships in international airspace or waters.\u201d Meanwhile, the Pentagon said it had the right to fly sorties off the North Korean coast and would continue to do so. Col Robert Manning, a defence department spokesman said that the US had weighed military options in confronting the threat from North Korea. \u201cIf North Korea does not stop their provocative actions \u2026 we will make sure that we provide options to the president to deal with North Korea,\u201d Manning said. Ri\u2019s threat came after a week in which tensions between the US and North Korea escalated rapidly, with an exchange of insults between Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, and which culminated in Trump\u2019s Sunday tweet and a sortie by US B-1B heavy bombers escorted by fighter planes off the North Korean coast \u2013 the first time this century that US warplanes have flown north of the demilitarized zone that has separated North and South Korea since the 1950-53 war. The US and North Korea have remained at war ever since, formally speaking. There was no peace treaty, and a UN armistice has remained in force since 1953. North Korea claims its national airspace as more than 50 miles off its coast, while the US recognizes only the international norm of 12 nautical miles. It is not clear how close Saturday\u2019s flight came to the North Korean coast. Nor is it entirely clear whether Pyongyang\u2019s anti-aircraft missiles could shoot down a US bomber. Its KN-06 missiles have an estimated range of nearly 100 miles, but it is not known whether it has the means to target and hit an offshore target. \u201cIt is easier to prevent penetration than strike an aircraft that is offshore. The US military will be calibrating how and where it flies,\u201d said Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress. \u201cIt will be tough to take shots, but we can\u2019t assume that they would fail.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to respond to a nuclear test \u2013 but if a US aircraft is shot at, there is a straightforward response, and many will want to shoot back at the missile site,\u201d Mount added. \u201cSo a conventional provocation is even more dangerous.\u201d This is not the first time the Pyongyang regime has accused the US of declaring war, and it has previously shot down US aircraft, a navy surveillance plane in 1969, killing 31 servicemen, and an army helicopter in 1994, killing a pilot. However, experts and officials say the risks of all out war are now substantially greater. North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), has developed and tested a nuclear warhead, probably a hydrogen bomb, and long range missiles, while the leaders of both countries have made the confrontation between their two countries, a personal test of strength. Vipin Narang, an expert on the Korean peninsula showdown at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said that the Pyongyang regime \u201creally hates the B-1B flights. They\u2019re clearly making the regime nervous about a surprise attack. This is how war by miscalculation starts.\u201d \u201cYesterday\u2019s flight went further north than any this century, though still in international airspace east of DPRK,\u201d Narang said. \u201cBut Kim seems to be worried, and reasonably so, that such a flight is exactly how a surprise decapitation or counterforce strike could start. So what we intend as a \u2018show of strength\u2019 could easily be mistaken as a prelude to a surprise attack, forcing Kim to go preemptively.\u201d He said: \u201cIt is unclear to me what the more aggressive shows of strength achieve \u2013 we can deter DPRK and reassure our allies in a multitude of other ways that are less risky and don\u2019t throw poison ivy all over Kim\u2019s itchy finger trigger.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned that heated rhetoric could only increases the risk of confrontation. \u201cFiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings,\u201d UN spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric told reporters. \u201cThe only solution for this is a political solution.\u201d",
