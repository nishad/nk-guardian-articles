    "content": "\u2018I tick a variety of boxes,\u201d says Francis Turnly, whose play The Great Wave is about to open in London at the National Theatre. \u201cAsian, British, Irish, mixed, none of these. It changes, depending on how I feel that day.\u201d Turnly\u2019s father was a Northern Irish journalist who at one point taught English in Tokyo. There he met Turnly\u2019s mother, and the family settled in County Antrim. When meeting people who are confused by the combination of his looks and accent, Turnly describes himself as \u201ca Japanese Ulsterman\u201d. Perhaps not surprisingly, he adds: \u201cAll my plays are about identity. I\u2019ve often written about someone becoming someone else, someone turning into something else.\u201d In another sense, Turnly has an unusual background for a playwright \u2013 his first profession was sheep farmer. Since 2015, he has been away from the farm a lot \u2013 given an office in London as Channel 4 writer in residence at the Tricycle Theatre. During his post, Turnly wrote two plays, both set in Japan: The Great Wave and Neko. These are the second and third parts of a trilogy that began with Harajuku Girls in 2015. The central characters in all three plays are young Japanese women. In Harajuku Girls, schoolgirls sample aspects of eastern and western culture on a Friday night in Tokyo. Neko, currently under discussion with a big theatre, is \u201cabout a Japanese schoolgirl who turns into a cat\u201d. The Great Wave begins with the disappearance of 17-year-old Hanako during a storm. The girl is believed by Japanese authorities to have drowned. The play takes the form of a moral thriller, with twists and surprises that Turnly reasonably pleads to be left for the audience to discover. One aspect of the narrative involves the so-called \u201ccomfort women\u201d, forced by the Imperial Japanese Army to work as sex slaves in occupied territories. That story has featured in various novels and plays \u2013 including Christopher Chen\u2019s Into the Numbers, which played in London until January \u2013 but Turnly\u2019s main focus is little-known events, such as the local consequence of forced prostitution. During six-months of research, the writer thought of going to North Korea as a tourist, but worried about being arrested as a spy: \u201cBeing stuck in North Korea for two years might have provided good material for a play but, in the end, it wasn\u2019t something I fancied.\u201d He had easier access to Japan because of frequent visits with his mother, who advised on some Japanese-language sequences: \u201cI had to run them past her. I only really have the restaurant basics myself.\u201d Some of Turnly\u2019s biggest artistic influences, though, are Japanese: the novelist Haruki Murakami (Norwegian Wood, A Wild Sheep Chase) and the film director Hayao Miyazaki (whose animated movies include Spirited Away). \u201cAs it\u2019s worked out,\u201d he says, \u201call of my theatre plays are about Japan and all of my BBC radio plays are about Northern Ireland.\u201d If this sounds like a policy, it isn\u2019t the writer\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve written stage plays that aren\u2019t set in Japan, but I can\u2019t get them on. I pitch radio plays about other things, but they say, \u2018Can we have another one in Northern Ireland?\u2019\u201d He hopes to write a dual-nationality play, perhaps about a Japanese tourist catching the wrong plane at Heathrow and landing in Belfast during the Troubles. Growing up, he was part of a \u201ctiny Japanese community in Northern Ireland, maybe a couple of hundred people\u201d. There is a joke about a Belfast resident who excused himself from the hostilities due to being Jewish, and received the reply: \u201cBut are you a Catholic Jew or a Protestant Jew?\u201d Did the Northern Irish Japanese suffer similar scrutiny? \u201cSure,\u201d says Turnly, now 43. \u201cMy mother\u2019s a Shinto, and there weren\u2019t a whole lot of temples out in County Antrim.\u201d He, however, felt little direct consequence of the violent years, through living far from the main trouble spots and because the peace process began when Turnly was a teenager. \u201cThere\u2019s a generation now that knows nothing about the Troubles. I\u2019m from the generation that was affected a little bit. You were aware of it, going to Belfast, checkpoints and so on. But at the moment, I feel safer in Belfast than I do in London.\u201d Two of the biggest tourist attractions, he notes, are the \u201cGame of Thrones locations tour\u201d, because the HBO series is filmed in Northern Ireland, and \u201cthe murals tour\u201d of the loyalist and nationalist wall paintings that reflected the city\u2019s divisions. Previous British productions of shows with Asian characters \u2013 from the original version of Miss Saigon to Howard Barker\u2019s recent In the Depths of Dead Love \u2013 have been criticised for \u201cyellow-face\u201d casting, in which white actors play Asian roles. The National is committed to culturally sensitive representation, but Turnly admits race-specific casting for The Great Wave was not an option: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to cast North Koreans, as there aren\u2019t a vast number of actors from there here. We have had people from Korean communities in London coming in to advise on language and so on. In the cast, we have two Japanese actors, two Malysian, one Vietnamese and four Chinese. So all east Asian. But it would have been impossible to cast like for like.\u201d Begun three years ago, The Great Wave now feels hotly contemporary. On the day we talk, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un suggested that he might suspend his nuclear weapons programme; subsequently, it was announced that the \u201cDear Leader\u201d would meet President Donald Trump. \u201cYes, what is happening now is very relevant to the play,\u201d he says. \u201cI keep hearing echoes of what I\u2019ve written.\u201d \u2022 The Great Wave is at the National Theatre, London, until 14 April.
