    "content": "Christianity is in danger of ceasing to be a truly global faith as increasing numbers of its followers flee violence and persecution across swaths of the Middle East and Africa, according to a new report. \u201cChristians are fast disappearing from entire regions \u2013 most notably a huge chunk of the Middle East but also whole dioceses in Africa. In large part, this migration is the product of an ethnic cleansing motivated by religious hatred,\u201d says Persecuted and Forgotten?, published on Tuesday by the Catholic campaign group, Aid to the Church in Need (ACN). Christianity was \u201cchanging from being a global faith to a regional one, with the faithful increasingly absent from ever-widening areas\u201d. Its latest report, covering the past two years, concludes that the difficulties facing Christians have worsened in 15 out of 19 countries under review. Militant Islamism is the main \u2013 and increasing \u2013 threat, but Christians have also been targeted by extremists of other faiths and totalitarian regimes such as North Korea. The report repeats claims that Christians are being \u201cdriven out of [the church\u2019s] ancient biblical heartland\u201d of the Middle East, saying they are \u201con course to disappear from Iraq possibly within five years \u2013 unless emergency help is provided at an international level on a massively increased scale\u201d. In Africa \u2013 described as \u201cthe one continent which until now has been the church\u2019s brightest hope for the future\u201d \u2013 the rise of militant Islamic groups in countries such as Nigeria, Kenya and Sudan is destabilising Christian presence, the report says. It says that Christians are the most persecuted faith group in the world, citing the Frankfurt-based International Society for Human Rights 2012 report, which estimated that 80% of all acts of religious discrimination were against Christians. The Centre for the Study of Global Christianity in the US estimates that 100,000 Christians die every year, although some question the legitimacy of this figure. The ACN\u2019s report says that in the past two years, the number of countries in which Christians suffered extreme persecution was 10, up from six in the period covered by its previous report. Iraq, Nigeria, Sudan and Syria joined China, Eritrea, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. It said 120,000 Christians had fled Mosul and Ninevah in Iraq after a takeover by Islamic State in the summer of 2014, and by May 2015, 100,000 Catholics had left the Nigerian diocese of Maiduguri in the wake of attacks by Boko Haram. It also warned of rising anti-Christian attacks by militant Buddhists in Burma and Sri Lanka. In a foreword to the report, Jean-Cl\u00e9ment Jeanbart, the Melkite Greek Catholic archbishop of Aleppo in Syria, said his cathedral had been bombed six times, and his home had been hit more than 10 times. Christians were defenceless against assaults by Isis, he said. \u201cWe are facing the rage of an extremist jihad; we may disappear soon.\u201d The Vatican sent ACN a message of support for the report\u2019s launch on Tuesday, saying Pope Francis appreciated efforts to keep \u201cbefore the world the plight and suffering of Christians persecuted for their faith\u201d. David Cameron, the UK prime minister, also spoke out against systematic discrimination against Christians in a message for the report\u2019s launch, saying the government was committed to promoting religious freedom and tolerance in the UK and around the world. \u201cNow is not the time for silence. We must stand together and fight for a world where no one is persecuted because of what they believe,\u201d the prime minister said. ACN has launched fundraising campaigns to assist Christian refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere, although some critics have said all refugees should be eligible for help regardless of their religion.",
