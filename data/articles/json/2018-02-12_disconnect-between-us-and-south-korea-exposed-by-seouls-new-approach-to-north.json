    "content": "South Korea has announced it will press ahead with improving ties with North Korea, arranging family reunions between those divided by the Korean war and seeking to cool military tensions \u2013 despite the US\u2019s commitment to a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Kim Jong-un. The announcement from Seoul\u2019s unification ministry comes a day after a high-level North Korean delegation \u2013 including Kim\u2019s sister \u2013 concluded a visit to the South that culminated in an invitation from Kim Jong-un for his counterpart Moon Jae-in to visit Pyongyang. The growing rapprochement between the two neighbours \u2013 still technically at war \u2013 has exposed a disconnect in policy between Seoul and Washington, a split Pyongyang has been trying to encourage since the end of the 1950-53 Korean conflict. It became plain after US vice-president Mike Pence visited South Korea for the opening of the Winter Olympics at the weekend, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s a definite fissure in the alliance. You can see it in Pence\u2019s face if nothing else,\u201d said Van Jackson, a former policy adviser to the US secretary of defence. \u201cThe US and South Korea want to present a united front, but they have completely different priorities: South Korea doesn\u2019t want war, and the US doesn\u2019t want North Korea to have nuclear weapons.\u201d Despite Washington\u2019s hardline approach to dealing with North Korea, Pence made a small concession on Monday, saying the US was willing to talk directly with North Korea in what he called \u201cmaximum pressure and engagement at the same time\u201d, according to the Washington Post. However, if South Korea\u2019s efforts do lead to direct talks between the US and North Korea, those negotiations would be \u201claughable\u201d, Jackson said. \u201cOne side demands immediate de-nuclearisation and the other says it will never give up its nuclear weapons.\u201d But throughout the Olympic venues there was a sense of euphoria.The days of Kim Jong-un\u2019s threats to attack the US seemed like ancient history. Instead, the focus has been on the combined women\u2019s ice hockey team, the first time in history players from the two Koreas competed together at the Games. Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, will visit Pyongyang sometime after the Games end on 25 February, according to a Reuters report. Bach met North Korean officials \u2013 and watched a hockey match with them \u2013 during their trip to Pyeongchang. \u201cI would love the team to get the Nobel peace prize,\u201d said Angela Ruggiero, a senior US member of the IOC\u2019s executive board, adding she would ask for them to be nominated. \u201cAs someone who competed in four Olympics and knows it isn\u2019t about you, your team, or your country, I saw the power of what it did last night.\u201d North Korean officials watched the game with Moon and state radio hailed a visit by Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un\u2019s sister, as \u201can important occasion in improving relations\u201d, saying it provided \u201can environment for peace on the Korean peninsula\u201d. Meanwhile, media in North Korea took aim at the US. \u201cPence must know that his frantic acts of abusing the sacred Olympics for confrontational ruckus are as foolish and stupid an act as sweeping the sea with a broom,\u201d said a commentary in the Rodong Sinmun, published by the ruling Workers\u2019 party. \u201cHis behaviour is nothing but an ugly sight being reminded of crazy Trump.\u201d Pence had attempted to conceal cracks in the alliance, declaring there was \u201cno daylight\u201d between the US and South Koean in policy toward Pyongyang. During his flight back to the US, Pence said: \u201cNo pressure comes off until they are actually doing something that the alliance believes represents a meaningful step toward denuclearization. \u201cSo the maximum pressure campaign is going to continue and intensify. But if you want to talk, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy, but cautioned pressure would remain the focus of US policy. \u201cPence\u2019s strategy in Pyeongchang backfired in a big way,\u201d Oba said. \u201cHe lent credibility to the narrative of a US-South Korea split and gave North Korea ammunition to blame the United States if inter-Korean engagement falls apart. \u201cHe should have kept his concerns in diplomatic channels while broadcasting US-South Korea unity at every opportunity.\u201d",
