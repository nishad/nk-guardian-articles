    "content": "Donald Trump said on Saturday he was open to talking to Kim Jong-un and hoped good could come from negotiations between North and South Korea over this year\u2019s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The US president also took credit for those talks, saying: \u201cIf I weren\u2019t involved they wouldn\u2019t be talking about Olympics right now. They\u2019d be doing no talking or it would be much more serious.\u201d North and South Korea have agreed to discuss cooperation on the games as well as other issues in rare meetings set to begin on Tuesday in Panmunjom, a village that straddles the demilitarised zone between the two countries. Amid international concern over Pyongyang\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes, the talks will be the first staged since December 2015. The discussions will be held at the Peace House on the South Korean side of Panmunjom. This week began on a less diplomatic note, with Trump tweeting his latest strongly worded messages to the North Korean leader, whom he has tauntingly referred to on social media and even at the United Nations as \u201cRocket Man\u201d or \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d. \u201cNorth Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the \u2018Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times\u2019,\u201d the president wrote on Tuesday. \u201cWill someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d The tweet prompted alarm and criticism around the world. Speaking to reporters at Camp David in Maryland on Saturday, at the end of a week marked by the publication of an explosive book about his administration and his mental capacity for his job, the president was asked if he would speak to Kim on the telephone. \u201cSure, I believe in talking,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 Absolutely I would do that, no problem with that at all.\u201d Asked if that meant there would be no prerequisites for such talk, the president said: \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said at all.\u201d Trump added: \u201c[Kim] knows I\u2019m not messing around, not even a little bit, not even 1%. He understands that. \u201cAt the same time, if we can come up with a very peaceful and very good solution, we\u2019re working on it with [secretary of state] Rex [Tillerson], we\u2019re working on it with a lot of people. \u201cIf something good can happen and come out of those talks it would be a great thing for all of humanity. That would be a great thing for the world. Very important.\u201d Trump also said President Moon Jae-in of South Korea had thanked him \u201cvery much for my tough stance\u201d and added that previous US governments \u201cyou know, for 25 years they haven\u2019t been using a tough stance, they\u2019ve been giving everything\u201d. \u201cYou have to have a certain attitude and you have to be prepared to do certain things and I\u2019m totally prepared to do that,\u201d he said, in a more allusive version of previous threats to turn to military action that have included the promise of \u201cfire and fury\u201d that gave Michael Wolff\u2019s book its title. Trump added: \u201cA lot of people have said and a lot of people have written that without my rhetoric and without my tough stance \u2013 and it\u2019s not just a stance, I mean this is what has to be done \u2013 that they wouldn\u2019t be talking about Olympics, they wouldn\u2019t be talking right now.\u201d",
