    "content": "On the presidency \u201cI loved my previous life. I had so many things going. This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier. You\u2019re really into your own little cocoon, because you have such massive protection that you really can\u2019t go anywhere. I like to drive. I can\u2019t drive any more.\u201d On Kim Jong-un \u201cHe\u2019s 27 years old, his father dies, took over a regime, so say what you want but that\u2019s not easy, especially at that age. You know you have plenty of generals in there and plenty of other people that would like to do what he\u2019s doing. So I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019ve, I\u2019m just telling you, and I\u2019m not giving him credit or not giving him credit. I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he\u2019s rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he\u2019s rational.\u201d On Chinese president Xi and North Korea \u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to see turmoil and death. He doesn\u2019t want to see it. He\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s a very good man and I got to know him very well ... We\u2019ll see how it all works out. I know he would like to be able to do something. Perhaps it\u2019s possible that he can\u2019t. But I think he\u2019d like to be able to do something.\u201d On North Korea \u201cThere\u2019s a chance that we could end up having a major, major, conflict with North Korea, absolutely.\u201d Q: Is that your biggest global worry at this point? \u201cYes, I would say that\u2019s true, yes ... North Korea would be certainly that.\u201d On South Korea and Thaad \u201cOn the Thaad system, it\u2019s about a billion dollars. I said, \u2018Why are we paying? Why are we paying a billion dollars? We\u2019re protecting. Why are we paying a billion dollars?\u2019 So I informed South Korea it would be appropriate if they paid. Nobody\u2019s going to do that. Why are we paying a billion dollars? It\u2019s a billion-dollar system. It\u2019s phenomenal. It\u2019s the most incredible equipment you\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 shoots missiles right out of the sky. And it protects them and I want to protect them. We\u2019re going to protect them. But they should pay for that, and they understand that.\u201d On the end of Islamist terrorism \u201cWe can\u2019t let them come over here. I have to say, there is an end. And it has to be humiliation. There is an end. Otherwise it\u2019s really tough. But there is an end. We are really eradicating some very bad people. When you take a look at what\u2019s going on with the cutting off of the heads. We haven\u2019t seen that since medieval times. Right?\u201d On Nafta \u201cYou know I was really ready and psyched to terminate Nafta. You saw that, you wrote about it. And I said I\u2019ve had it. I\u2019ve had it ... I\u2019m not looking to hurt Canada and I\u2019m not looking to hurt Mexico. They\u2019re two countries I really like. So they asked to renegotiate, and I said yes. On speaking to Taiwan\u2019s leader again \u201cWell, my problem is that I\u2019ve established a very good personal relationship with Xi. And I really feel that he is doing everything in his power to help us with a big situation, so I wouldn\u2019t want to be causing difficulty right now for him ... So I would certainly want to speak to him first.\u201d On a possible government shutdown \u201cIf there\u2019s closure, there\u2019s closure. We\u2019ll see what happens. If there\u2019s a shutdown it\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 fault. Not our fault. It\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 fault. Maybe they\u2019d like to see a shutdown.\u201d On peace in the Middle East \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility, we\u2019re talking to both. It\u2019s a possibility, but I want to see peace with Israel and the Palestinians. There is no reason there\u2019s not peace between Israel and the Palestinians \u2013 none whatsoever.\u201d",
