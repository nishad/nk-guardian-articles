    "content": "Malcolm Turnbull has clarified Barnaby Joyce\u2019s suggestion that Australia would have sympathy for imposing trade sanctions on China over its relations with North Korea, reiterating that longstanding sanctions are imposed under the United Nations. Speaking in Hamburg before the G20 summit, the prime minister said Australia already supported sanctions on individual companies dealing with North Korea over its continued nuclear weapons program. \u201cWe are a party to and of course support the sanctions imposed by the United Nations and we also have autonomous sanctions of our own against North Korean entities and individuals,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cBut we will work cooperatively through the United Nations and taking measured steps autonomously, but focused on bringing the economic pressure to bear on North Korea to bring that regime to its senses without conflict.\u201d On Thursday, after North Korea\u2019s successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, the deputy prime minister said Australia would have sympathy for US trade sanctions against China for \u201caiding and abetting\u201d North Korea. On Friday Donald Trump said he was considering some \u201cvery severe things\u201d and called on other countries to exert pressure on Pyongyang over its \u201cvery bad behaviour\u201d. Turnbull refused to speculate on what steps the US might take but he reiterated that North Korea\u2019s missile program was illegal and dangerous and again urged China to act as the country with the greatest leverage over Pyongyang. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, also clarified that Australia had no plans to impose trade sanctions on China. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said Joyce was talking about sanctions on individual companies dealing with North Korea, not just Chinese companies, already imposed under the UN. Labors\u2019s foreign affairs shadow, Penny Wong, said more thinking before speaking would be useful as North Korea escalated its global threat to all nations. \u201c[Joyce] did clarify that afterwards, but really a little more thinking before speaking would have been useful,\u201d Wong said. \u201cNorth Korea has escalated the threat to all nations. They are a risk to global security and the global community must act together to counter that threat. \u201cI think that Barnaby\u2019s approach is not the right way of approaching this. I think we should be urging China to do more, we should be urging all the nations of the world to work together to deal with what is a global threat.\u201d Turnbull met the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, overnight when they discussed countering terrorism and radicalisation. The meeting also confirmed a \u201cshared commitment to an open, rules-based trading system\u201d as the US ramps up its rhetoric of trade sanctions. \u201cWe obviously have a great deal to discuss about trade to ensure that we maintain free and open markets in the world today, on which our economy and our economic growth and the opportunity of Australians depend,\u201d Turnbull said. The meeting reaffirmed the Paris climate change agreement and a shared commitment to women\u2019s economic empowerment and workforce participation. But the North Korean issue has overshadowed the G20 meeting, which has been marked by protests. German police have used water cannon and pepper spray to disperse an anti-capitalist protest dubbed the \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d march.",
