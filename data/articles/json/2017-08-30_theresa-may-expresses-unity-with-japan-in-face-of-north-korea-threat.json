    "content": "Theresa May has promised that the UK will stand \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with Japan over the threat from North Korea, with the prime minister due to announce in Tokyo an increase in mutual cooperation over defence and cyber-security. However, the prime minister faced a rebuff from China over her call for North Korea\u2019s neighbour and sometime ally to exert more pressure on Pyongyang, with the foreign ministry in Beijing calling such attitudes hypocritical. May spent most of her discussions with her Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, on the first of a three-day trip to Japan discussing security issues in the wake of North Korea\u2019s decision to fire a missile over northern Japan on Tuesday, her spokeswoman said. The missile triggered warning sirens before breaking apart over the sea. \u201cThe prime minister told Prime Minister Abe that the UK stood shoulder to shoulder with Japan in facing North Korean aggression,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThe prime minister also discussed the importance of the show of unity at the UN security council last night in speaking with one voice against North Korean aggression.\u201d She added: \u201cPrime Minister Abe and the prime minister agreed that it was important to send a powerful message to North Korea that it won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201d May and Abe discussed the possibility of new sanctions against North Korea, and were due to discuss the issue again on Thursday, when May will visit a Japanese warship. Earlier in the day, May\u2019s message on the issue had been to call for China to do more to exert influence on the issue. Calling the firing of the missile \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201ca provocation\u201d, May urged the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to do more, saying his country was \u201cthe key in this\u201d. \u201cChina has, I think, a very key role to play in terms of the pressure it can bring,\u201d May said. \u201cI have said this to President Xi, other have as well. We think that China has a role to play and we\u2019d encourage China to do everything it can to bring pressure on North Korea to stop this.\u201d This brought a robust response from China\u2019s foreign ministry, with a spokesman, Hun Chunying, saying critics of Beijing\u2019s stance \u201conly pay attention to sanctions and pressure, and ignore peace talks\u201d. She added: \u201cYou will reap what you sow. The parties directly concerned should take responsibility.\u201d On Thursday, May was to address Japan\u2019s national security council, where she is due to announce what is billed as an era of closer cooperation over security matters, in part prompted by North Korea. The countries are to sign a so-far slightly vague joint declaration on security, covering defence, cyber-security and terrorism. May was to tell the security council that the closer ties \u201cmust include confronting the threat that North Korea poses and ensuring the regime stops its aggressive acts\u201d, according to an excerpt of the speech released by Downing Street. The British PM is also seeking to use her three-day visit to Japan to reassure the country that the UK can swiftly replicate the trade benefits of EU membership after Brexit. The first day of the trip saw the pair take in a traditional tea ceremony in Kyoto, Japan\u2019s former imperial capital, before a dinner, where the dishes included salted sea cucumber entrails with yam. During a joint train trip to Tokyo on a Shinkansen (bullet train), May briefed Abe on the progress of Brexit. Discussions on Thursday will centre on May\u2019s hope to kick-start post-Brexit trade by replicating existing or pending deals agreed by the EU, starting with Japan. May said she would be urging Tokyo to push ahead with longstanding talks to seal a wide-ranging EU-Japan trade deal, with the idea this could then be used as a model for a British deal. She said the UK could then push for bespoke changes to the arrangement in future. \u201cEven if we start on the basis of an existing trade deal that a country has with the EU, it will be up to the United Kingdom and that country if we wish to renegotiate and change those terms in the future,\u201d she said. However, the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, ridiculed her approach, saying it amounted to a \u201ccut and paste Brexit\u201d. He said: \u201cBrexiteers promised a new dawn of improved trade deals across the world. But rather than jet-setting round the globe, Liam Fox might as well be left in a room with a photocopier.\u201d",
