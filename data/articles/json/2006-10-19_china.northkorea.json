    "content": "International pressure was mounting on North Korea today to abandon plans to conduct another nuclear test as a Chinese presidential envoy met the regime\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-il, while the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, arrived in Seoul to bolster regional support for UN sanctions. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman confirmed that Tang Jiaxuan, a state councillor, had flown to Pyongyang yesterday to deliver a message from the Chinese president, Hu Jintao. \u201cThis is a very significant visit, against the backdrop of major changes on the Korean peninsula,\u201d Liu Jianchao said, adding that he did not know the contents of the message. Ms Rice, meanwhile, was expected to apply pressure on South Korea to support the sanctions regime agreed last weekend by the UN security council after the North detonated a nuclear bomb on October 9. The US is known to be irritated by South Korea\u2019s perseverance with its \u201csunshine\u201d policy of economic engagement with the Pyongyang regime, although signs emerged today that Seoul was ratcheting up the pressure on its neighbour. The Yonhap news agency reported that South Korea was about to cut off funding for a joint tourism venture with the North and would step up inspections of cargo and North Korean ships. It was also considering a ban on shipments of emergency aid provided after floods hit the North in July. The region was waiting to see what success, if any, China would have in persuading Mr Kim not to conduct more tests amid signs that the regime was preparing to detonate a second nuclear bomb. Chung Hyung-keun, a South Korean MP who sits on the country\u2019s intelligence committee, said the North could be preparing for as many as four more tests. \u201cChecking indications coming from intelligence agencies of different countries, it is certain that the North will conduct three or four additional nuclear tests in the future,\u201d he said. China is North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner and longtime political ally, although its patience with Mr Kim appeared to be wearing thin after last week\u2019s nuclear test. A US official travelling with Ms Rice told reporters that Washington was expecting the Chinese delegation to take a tough line with the North. \u201cI\u2019m pretty convinced that the Chinese will have a very strong message about future tests,\u201d the official said. The test has also sparked fears that North Korea may attempt to sell nuclear technology to other states and terrorist organisations. In Washington, the US president, George Bush, said the North would face \u201ca grave consequence\u201d if it was found to be attempting to transfer nuclear technology. \u201cI want ... the leader of North Korea to understand that he\u2019ll be held to account,\u201d he said. In the morning, Ms Rice secured Japan\u2019s agreement to do all it could to assist US inspections of North Korean ships for nuclear technology and materials, although Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, which prohibits its troops from involvement in overseas conflicts, may limit its ability to provide military backup. \u201cEnsuring the implementation of the UN security council resolution will lead to changing North Korean policies,\u201d the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said after his talks with Ms Rice. \u201cIn order to do so, we will work out the details of what we can do and what we need to do on the working level.\u201d In a television interview Ms Rice said Japan had a critical role to play in enforcing sanctions, despite the constitutional restraints. \u201cI think there is no doubt Japan will be a strong pillar,\u201d she said in an interview with the public broadcaster NHK. \u201cThere is plenty that can be done under existing authorities.\u201d",
