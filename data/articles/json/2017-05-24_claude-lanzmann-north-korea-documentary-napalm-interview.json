    "content": "At 91, Claude Lanzmann is a virtual folk memory of cinema. He is the former teenage fighter in the French resistance whose Jewish family went into hiding when war broke out. In 1985, he directed Shoah, the eight-hour documentary about the Holocaust composed almost entirely of first-person testimony. Now in Cannes, he has premiered a film about his personal experiences in North Korea. Napalm is a movie that, initially, takes its cue from the underreported fact that the US used the incendiary weapon in the Korean war of 1950-53. Last year, Lanzmann bluffed his way into North Korea on the bizarre pretext of making a film about the country\u2019s love of taekwondo, and indeed his documentary does contain hilarious footage of terrifying fighters. But Lanzmann had another purpose: he wanted to revisit the place in Pyongyang where, in the 1950s, he had an extraordinary experience. Visiting as part of a cultural delegation, Lanzmann felt unwell one day and asked for vitamin injections. These were administered by a beautiful nurse called Kim Kum-sun , who made daily visits to his hotel room and with whom he ended up having a passionate romance \u2013 until they were discovered by the authorities. The second half of the film is given over to his first-person account. It is a story that is political, personal, erotic and sad. Lanzmann spoke to me about the experience in a villa on the Croisette. He is a solid, Buddha-like man, sometimes resting his chin on his cane, gazing impassively out to sea as he considers my questions. How did he approach such a personally painful subject? \u201cIt was a challenge to make a film with a story from my own life. Another man might have said, \u2018OK, we will shoot this film as fiction. It will be in another country, in Asia, yes, but another country, another river \u2013 and with actors.\u2019 But no, this story happened to me. It would be difficult to give my part to just anyone, to an actor. It would be a betrayal.\u201d What about the difficulties of shooting in North Korea? \u201cIt was almost impossible. There were always people there holding me \u2013 very strongly.\u201d He grabs his right forearm to show me. \u201cSometimes they put me in pain. But I couldn\u2019t say what I was doing. They thought I was making a film about taekwondo.\u201d Lanzmann giggles at the absurdity. But those scenes allowed him to get around in Pyongyang, although always harassed by his official minders with their strange fixed grins. \u201cThose scenes about taekwondo are very funny,\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut then we get to the main story, about me. I am now old and wrinkled, and did the best I could.\u201d It is a tremendous tale. But how about an ending? Was he tempted to try to contact the nurse? Lanzmann\u2019s reply is emphatic, even curt: \u201cNon. No. I did not want. She is probably dead. Life is shorter there than here. But even if she is alive, to see her as an old woman, I did not like this idea.\u201d I thought, on watching the film, that there was something incurious, even ungallant, about Lanzmann\u2019s reluctance. But now I can see his pain at the thought. It would have been a kind of taboo. But could this nurse have been some sort of honeytrap, someone who knew more than she was letting on, and had some complicity with the authorities? Again, Lanzmann\u2019s response is cutting: \u201cIt is impossible. When we started to \u2026 to \u2026 embrace\u201d \u2013 he mimes hugging \u2013 \u201cand kiss each other madly, there was no preparation. It would be impossible. It is probably because you read too much John le Carr\u00e9 that you think this. But I like your idea. It is a very British idea.\u201d Like any film-maker who has been in North Korea, he is fascinated by Pyongyang, an extraordinary place, a final frontier of strangeness. \u201cIt is like a dream. It is a city that is monumental. And empty. It is a city of \u2018as if\u2019. When I was there in the 50s, you could see a policewoman with Soviet uniform and cap, directing traffic at the corner of the street, mechanically. It was funny because the traffic was only pedestrians. There were no cars.\u201d Does he think North Korea will be the site of a new Cuban-missile-type crisis with Donald J Trump? \u201cI cannot think this. There is a lot of bluff. They are very, very far from being able to launch a missile at the US. They play with this, they are clever. But you know, the North Koreans will become the best friend of Trump. It is not impossible. Trump is a very funny bloke.\u201d Perhaps he should make a film about the US president? Lanzmann nods and smiles. \u201cYes, it is possible. If I do this, I will call you.\u201d",
