    "content": "The first time Joseph Kim heard the words \u201cChristian\u201d and \u201cchurch\u201d, he had no idea what they meant. He had never seen a church and Christianity was as unfamiliar to him in his famine-ravaged North Korea as Disneyland. \u201cKwang Jin\u201d, a friend said to him, using the Korean name by which Kim was then known, \u201cif you ever go to China, the churches will give you money.\u201d To which Kim replied: \u201cWhat\u2019s a church? Why would they just give you money?\u201d \u201cBecause they\u2019re Christians,\u201d the friend said. \u201cWhat are Christians?\u201d Kim asked. That Kim should have known nothing about Christianity when he was growing up in North Korea was hardly surprising. Born in 1990, the only belief system to which he was exposed as a child was reverence, mixed with fear, for the Great Leader. When he was very young he was taught in kindergarten about the magical powers of Kim Il-sung, then supreme leader of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Kim learned that the dictator was the smartest man in the world and that he was able to fly around the countryside keeping watch over all his children. But if the cult of the Great Leader left no room for Christianity, or any other organised religion in Kim\u2019s youth, the importance of money was most certainly not lost on him. Prolonged famine had struck the country when he was five, killing more than a million people and in effect turning Kim into an orphan. His father died of hunger-induced illness, his mother ended up in a North Korean prison camp, and his beloved sister was probably sold as a child bride in China. As he describes in his memoir of becoming a defector, Under the Same Sky: From Starvation in North Korea to Salvation in America, Kim was driven to increasingly desperate measures to survive. He ate wild plants and raspberry leaves, snails and grasshoppers, lived by petty crime and joined a network of homeless thieves called the \u201cgangster brothers\u201d. Eventually in 2006, at the age of 16, he decided he had nothing left to lose and made the perilous journey from his town of Hoeryong in the north of the country across the Tumen river into China. He remembered what his friend had told him about churches giving money, which chimed with what somebody told him as he knocked on doors in search of food inside China. \u201cYou must go to a Christian church,\u201d a Chinese woman said. \u201cHow do I find this church?\u201d he asked. \u201cLook for a cross,\u201d she replied. His search took him to a number of churches in Tumen City, the Chinese town where he arrived close to the North Korean border, and through them he was introduced to a network of Chinese-Korean Christians who were to prove his salvation. \u201cIf that hadn\u2019t happened, I don\u2019t know what other route I could have taken,\u201d Kim said in an interview with the Guardian in New York, where he now lives. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any relatives or friends I could find inside China, so this was my only hope.\u201d Unbeknown to Kim at that time, his connection with the Christians meant that he had entered the most sophisticated underground support network for North Korean defectors then in existence inside China. Backed with money and logistical support from South Korean-based, largely Presbyterian, churches, an intricate system was in place for hiding away, and then providing escape routes, for people who had fled famine or persecution in the DPRK. In Kim\u2019s case, he was sheltered in the home of a Korean-Chinese woman, aged about 75, whom he called Grandma. A woman of strong faith, she was a member of a South Korean church, which paid some of her rent and the expenses she incurred looking after North Korean defectors. It was a dangerous arrangement. If Grandma had been caught harbouring Kim, she would have faced a 5,000-yuan (\u00a3520) penalty \u2013 an enormous sum for her. If Kim had been caught, he would have been deported back to North Korea, where his connection with Christianity would have been severely punished. \u201cPublic execution would have been highly possible, but definitely I would have been sent to a prison camp back in North Korea,\u201d he said. The shelter and food that Kim received from Grandma and her Christian network did not come entirely without a cost. He was expected to embrace the religion. He attended Bible-reading lessons, and later Grandma took him to underground church services. At first it was all gobbledygook to him. When he arrived in China from North Korea he was, he said, \u201cnothing more than an animal who wants to live and have a bite to eat. There was nothing else. My primary concern was to find food. If you didn\u2019t constantly put yourself first, you would die. So ethics meant nothing to me, it was nothing more than a word.\u201d He admits in the early days he was only interested in what Christianity could give him. \u201cI was merely interested in the aid I could get from them. There was no sense of moral development.\u201d Over time, though, he did come to appreciate the lessons and to embrace the religion. The sacrifices made on his behalf by Grandma and other local Christians chimed with what he was reading in the Bible, and he started to understand the value of altruism. \u201cGrandma made a huge sacrifice and took great risks to help me. And that matched the story of Jesus I read in the Bible and I started to understand.\u201d But there was another sacrifice he found more difficult to accept. Early on in his contact with the Christians in China, he was told to change his name from Kwang Jin to the biblical Joseph Kim. He was shocked and offended by the demand. \u201cIt was a mixture of anger plus sadness,\u201d he said. \u201cI literally gave up everything I had to survive. I gave up my personality. I gave up the pride of being human. I had nothing to tie me to my parents and my past life. The only thing that identified me was my name \u2013 and now I was being told to give that up too.\u201d After around three months living under Grandma\u2019s protection, Kim was introduced to a non-religious group called Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), which works with defectors hiding in China and helps them seek asylum. LiNK facilitated his journey to the US consulate in Shenyang, and after four months there he was relocated to the US, where he has lived for eight years. Today he is preparing to start as an undergraduate at Bard College, New York, studying political science. He describes himself as a Christian and belongs to a South Korean church in Brooklyn. \u201cI\u2019m not the most ideal Christian, but I am Christian,\u201d he said. Over time he has grown to appreciate Christianity as a loving, altruistic faith. But he has also wrestled with doubts about the religion and why he had to join it in exchange for food and shelter. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel tremendous force to join the religion, but it\u2019s also true that I didn\u2019t have any other option. No one said to me, \u2018By the way you don\u2019t have to become a Christian to get help.\u2019 \u201cOne thing Christianity could do to help address the question is to say to North Korean defectors, \u2018It\u2019s totally up to you \u2013 whether you join the religion or not \u2013 we\u2019re going to help you regardless.\u2019 I think that could be helpful, but I don\u2019t know whether South Korean missionaries are prepared to do that.\u201d At moments of extreme doubt, Kim wonders whether Christianity could be another form of indoctrination. \u201cEven though no one forced me into Christianity, I definitely had internal pressure: if I didn\u2019t believe in God, would they still be helping me?\u201d He said he was still struggling with that moral conundrum. But he also remains enduringly grateful for the sacrifices made on his behalf by Grandma, and he deeply regrets that he has been unable to contact her since leaving China to thank her personally for the new life she gave him. \u201cShe played a huge role in my life \u2013 without her I wouldn\u2019t be here today,\u201d he said.",
