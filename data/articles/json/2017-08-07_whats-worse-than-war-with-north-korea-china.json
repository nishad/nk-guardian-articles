    "content": "On Saturday, the United Nations security council passed its most sweeping North Korea sanctions yet. The council banned the international sale of coal, Pyongyang\u2019s largest export, and other valuable items like iron ore and seafood \u2013 a move the White House said could slash North Korea\u2019s annual exports of roughly $3bn by a third. The vote represented the culmination of months of Trump\u2019s blandishments, cajolements and threats to Chinese leader Xi Jinping over how to contain North Korea\u2019s expanding nuclear weapons and missiles program. And by once again allowing North Korea to dominate US-China relations, it represents a further strategic mistake for the Trump administration. North Korea is a shadow puppet enlarged by American fears. This desperately poor nation of 25 million people captures Americans\u2019 attention because of its government\u2019s belligerence, missile and nuclear weapons capability, and ability to wreak havoc on South Korea, a key US ally. Yet China, which boasts 1.4 billion people, the world\u2019s largest army, and the potential to supplant the US as the most powerful and consequential nation, is the puppeteer. China has more influence on and leverage over Pyongyang than any other nation. In the extremely unlikely event that Pyongyang makes the suicidal decision to launch nuclear weapons at the US, China will go to war with North Korea \u2013 regardless of whether the missiles are successful. The determining factor in that war is the level of support Beijing gives the US \u2013 or North Korea. China is not only a potential threat or ally to the US when it comes to North Korea. The country\u2019s increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea, its tense relationship with Japan and its current border standoff with India are all flashpoints which could exceed North Korea in importance, and all of which could drag the US into a war. As America\u2019s largest and most important trading partner, strategic competitor in Europe and Africa, and occasional collaborator in the fight against Isis, China has more influence over the US economy, global standing and national security than North Korea does. China, in other words, is the nation that matters in US foreign policy. And yet North Korea remains center stage. After the November election, Barack Obama reportedly advised Donald Trump that North Korea should be the top national security priority \u2013 a poor suggestion that Trump has seemingly internalized, to the detriment of smart thinking about Chinese-US relations. Over the past several months, when Trump mentions China, he often does so with reference to North Korea. Like with so many other aspects of his life and ideas, Trump\u2019s Twitter feed serves as a barometer for his views on international relations. Since taking office in January, 19 of Donald Trump tweets have mentioned China, and slightly more \u2013 27 \u2013 mentioned Russia. While most of his Russia tweets serve to deny the Trump team\u2019s alleged 2016 collusion with Moscow \u2013 sample tweet: \u201cJust out: the Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8 about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?\u201d \u2013 the majority of his China tweets mention North Korea; demonstrating how interlinked those two issues are to Trump. Instead of viewing its relationship with China through the lens of North Korea, the US should see its relationship with North Korea as a part of its relationship with China \u2013 a country far more important to the safety and prosperity of the US. Why is the current situation problematic? For one, it allows Beijing to exploit Trump\u2019s focus on North Korea to further expand its interests elsewhere. While North Korea\u2019s existence as a buffer state \u2013 and the danger of it collapsing \u2013 are important to Beijing, the leaders of China\u2019s ruling communist party likely don\u2019t view Pyongyang existential threat to the party\u2019s grip on power. It\u2019s unclear what, if anything, the White House secretly traded to Beijing in exchange for more cooperation on North Korea. But it could be something more central to both nations\u2019 interests \u2013 like American support for Japan, or even Taiwan \u2013 than Beijing joining US sanctions against North Korea. More worryingly, the Trump administration\u2019s focus on North Korea seems to overlook the (hopefully remote) possibility Beijing would join a war on North Korea\u2019s side. A \u201cpreventive war\u201d is among the many options the US has to curb Pyongyang\u2019s missile and nuclear threats, national security adviser HR McMaster recently told MSNBC. In April, China\u2019s foreign minister Wang Yi ominously warned that if war comes to the Korean peninsula, there will be \u201cnothing but losing all round and no could become a winner\u201d. Would Beijing idly allow the US to bomb its neighbor? The answer to that question is unknown, but it\u2019s a dangerous uncertainty. Defense secretary James Mattis was more accurate when he warned in May that a war with North Korea would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and likely \u201cthe worst kind of fighting in most people\u2019s lifetimes\u201d. That\u2019s not to say Pyongyang isn\u2019t a threat, or that sanctions won\u2019t work. It is, and they might. Rather, let\u2019s not forget that no matter how large it looms, North Korea will never come close to dominating the 21st century. China might.",
