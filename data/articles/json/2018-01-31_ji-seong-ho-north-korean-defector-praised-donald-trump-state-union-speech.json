    "content": "Some of the loudest applause during Donald Trump\u2019s state of the union address greeted his introduction to Ji Seong-ho, a human rights and disability campaigner who must now be the world\u2019s most recognisable North Korean defector. After paying tribute to Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died last summer after being held in North Korea, Trump devoted several lines to Ji\u2019s dramatic flight to freedom. With North Korea in the grip of a famine that would kill hundreds of thousands, Ji was 13 years old living in North Hamgyeong province when he lost his left hand and his left foot in a train accident while searching for coal to exchange for food. He underwent a four-and-a-half-hour operation without an anaesthetic. Denied rehabilitative care, he has attributed his survival to his family, who shared their rations with him as he recuperated. \u201cNorth Korea is already a society where everybody is trying to eat and survive on their own, so they don\u2019t really care whether you are disabled or not,\u201d Ji wrote in the Guardian in 2014. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it was. There aren\u2019t any groups that focus on or cater to the disabled community. There was no help from the government.\u201d His only means of getting around was a pair of wooden crutches made by his father, who would later be tortured to death by North Korean authorities after a failed attempt to defect. His mother and sister defected in 2004. Ji held those crutches aloft in the US House of Representatives on Tuesday night, prompting cheers and a standing ovation. \u201cToday he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYour great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.\u201d The same crutches had taken Ji across thousands of miles during his journey to South Korea, which began when he and his brother, Ji Cheol-ho, crossed the freezing Tumen river under cover of darkness in 2006. After separating from his brother, Ji made his way across China and on to Thailand, Laos and Taiwan, before being reunited with his family in Seoul six months later. Like many other North Korean defectors, he struggled financially and lived in a tiny flat while studying law at Dongguk University in the South Korean capital. \u201cBut I\u2019m definitely happier here,\u201d he said in a 2012 interview. \u201cThe difference between South and North Korea is like the difference between heaven and hell.\u201d As president of Now Action and Unity for Human Rights \u2013 a group that raises awareness of North Korean human rights abuses and helps defectors settle in the South \u2013 Ji has travelled the world highlighting the brutality of the regime. The 35-year-old addressed the British parliament in 2014 and has spoken at the Oslo Freedom Forum. And on Wednesday, Ji was honoured by the US president, who said: \u201cSeong-ho\u2019s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.\u201d",
