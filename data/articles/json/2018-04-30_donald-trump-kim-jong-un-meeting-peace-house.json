    "content": "Donald Trump on Monday tweeted a suggestion that his planned meeting with Kim Jong-un could take place at the Peace House on the border between North and South Korea, the same site as Kim\u2019s historic meeting last week with South Korean president Moon Jae-in. Moon, meanwhile, suggested that Trump should win the Nobel peace prize for his efforts to end the nuclear standoff with Pyongyang. \u201cNumerous countries are being considered for the MEETING,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cbut would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North &amp; South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? \u201cJust asking!\u201d Later Trump gave the most detailed preview yet of potential venues for the talks. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at various countries, including Singapore, and we are also talking about the possibility of the DMZ,\u201d he told reporters in the White House rose garden. \u201cAnd there\u2019s something that I thought was intriguing. I think that some people maybe don\u2019t like the look of that and some people like it very much. I threw it out today as idea ... There\u2019s something that I like about it because you\u2019re there, you\u2019re actually there, where if things work out, there\u2019s a great celebration to be had on the site, not in a third-party country.\u201d Speaking at a joint press conference with Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari, Trump made clear his appetite for spectacle and suspense. \u201cI will say this, the good news, everybody wants us, it has the chance to be a big event ... The United States has never been closer to potentially having something happen with respect to the Korean peninsula that can get rid of the nuclear weapons, can create so many good things, so many positive things, and peace and safety for the world. So we\u2019ll see what happens. I often say, who knows?\u201d He described Kim as having been \u201cvery open and very straightforward so far. I can only say again, so far.\u201d On Sunday, some of Trump\u2019s key advisers counselled caution on North Korea, despite the historic events of last week and conciliatory messages coming out of Pyongyang about possible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, the expressed aim of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy. The new national security adviser, John Bolton, a noted hawk, told CBS: \u201cWhat we want to see from them is evidence that it\u2019s real and not just rhetoric.\u201d The new secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who as CIA director met Kim in North Korea at Easter, told ABC the administration would not be fooled. \u201cWe know the history, we know the risks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to negotiate in a different way than before, we\u2019re going to require steps that demonstrate denuclearization is going to be achieved. We\u2019re not going to take promises or words, we are going to look for actions and deeds.\u201d At a rally in Michigan on Saturday night, Trump gave a hint about the timing of his possible meeting with Kim. \u201cI think we will have a meeting over the next three or four weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going be a very important meeting, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But we\u2019ll see how it goes. I may go in, it may not work out, I leave.\u201d Trump\u2019s words were greeted with chants of \u201cNobel! Nobel!\u201d South Korea\u2019s president agrees. Moon told a cabinet meeting the American president should win a Nobel peace prize, a South Korean official said on Monday. \u201cPresident Trump should win the Nobel peace prize,\u201d Moon said, according to a presidential Blue House official who briefed media. \u201cWhat we need is only peace.\u201d On Friday, Moon and Kim pledged to end hostilities between the two countries and work towards the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean peninsula in the first inter-Korean summit in more than a decade. Trump\u2019s meeting with Kim was the main subject of a private walk and chat Kim and Moon had during their meeting at the border, the South Korean official said. In January, Moon said Trump \u201cdeserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks. It could be a resulting work of the US-led sanctions and pressure.\u201d The president\u2019s breezy tweet about his meeting with Kim followed on the heels of a tweet in which he complained about a comedian\u2019s routine at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner in Washington on Saturday. The event was \u201ca total disaster and an embarrassment\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201cFAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented.\u201d",
