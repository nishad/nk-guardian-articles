    "content": "Dennis Rodman is at it again, talking about two of his favourite subjects: sports and North Korea. The celebrity gossip website TMZ caught up with the former NBA star this week as he got on to a bus, and it was evident that he believes his sporting relationship with the country is still going strong. Dodging questions about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s recent time out of the public eye, Rodman said that he would be returning to the peninsula in November to bring pro-wrestling to the North. It was unclear whether Rodman knew that he is not the first to have this idea. Earlier this month a throwdown, organised by a Japanese wrestler-turned-MP, saw North Koreans wrestlers line up against an international competitors in front of dozens of reporters, tourists and celebrity guests. In 1995 Collision in Korea was the largest pay-per-view event in the history of pro-wrestling. It attracted a crowd of 340,000 people and was described by one of the news anchors at \u201cwrestling and diplomacy at it\u2019s best.\u201d Critics have previously dismissed the Kim Jong-un-Dennis Rodman relationship as ego-driven, dysfunctional and damaging for diplomatic relations. He has skirted around the human rights issue during his previous trips, and got himself tangled up in the case of Kenneth Bae \u2013 the American serving 15 years hard labour in North Korea for crimes against the state. If the claim comes good, it will be the fifth big trip for Rodman to the country in just under two years. We take a look back at his most prolific visits, what he said and how the world reacted. February 2013 Rodman makes headlines by arriving in North Korea with a group of players for the Harlem Globetrotters and a Vice film crew for some self-styled \u201cbasketball diplomacy\u201d. Rodman and Kim watch basketball together and the visiting entourage was reportedly treated to alcoholic drinks provided by the leader. Rodman tells Kim \u201cyou have a friend for life\u201d. The trip took place amid continued hostility between the US government and North Korea. An official statement from the White House said that it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for North Korea to have spent money on such a big spectacle when people were being starved and denied their human rights. When asked about the trip secretary of state John Kerry said: \u201cYou know what? Dennis Rodman was a great basketball player, and as a diplomat, he was a great basketball player. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave it\u201d. Whilst Rodman is there he also makes internet history becoming one of the first to tweet from the country on a 3G network newly opened for foreign tourists, using the hashtag #WORMinNorthKorea (Worm being his nickname from his basketball playing days). September 2013 A few months later Rodman was back again but this time it was a more low-key affair. \u201cThe Marshal Kim and I had a relaxing time by the sea with his family\u201d said Rodman, before accidently announcing to the world the name of Kim\u2019s daughter: Ju-ae. Leaving Vice behind (the regime wasn\u2019t happy about the negative coverage from his last visit, according to Buzzfeed), Rodman finds new facilitators led by Michael P Spavor, a consultant specialising in sports and cultural exchanges with the DPRK. Spavor\u2019s website features him enjoying a few laughs with Kim Jong-un, and he describes September\u2019s trip as \u201ca blast\u201d. December 2013 Squeezing in a last trip in 2013 Rodman arrived back in North Korea in December for a sponsored trip to help train the North Korean basketball team in preparation for the leader\u2019s birthday. Rodman\u2019s team arrive shortly after the dramatic, highly publicised execution of Kim\u2019s uncle Jang Song-thaek: thought to be a strong message from the regime about the importance of absolute loyalty. Ahead of the trip, Rodman says he does not intend raise the issue with the leader because he doesn\u2019t want to exploit his friendship for political reasons, but then refuses to say whether the pair even met up on his return. Shortly after, the sponsors, Paddy Power, pull out in \u201creaction to the worldwide focus and total condemnation of the North Korean regime over recent events\u201d. January 2014 In January, Rodman is back \u2013 again \u2013 with a team of NBA players to perform an exhibition game, a birthday present to Kim Jong-un. Not content with the basketball spectacle, Rodman takes to centre court to sing a quick happy birthday is hushed tones in front of the crowds applauding uniformly. This time it\u2019s the NBA who speak out against the Rodman show, arguing that \u201cbirthday parties for dictators that torture and kill\u201d should not be thought of as sports diplomacy. Rodman also found himself again embroiled in controversy around American prisoner Kenneth Bae, whose detention is a tense sticking point between US and North Korea. In May 2013 he had tweeted that he would ask his friend Kim to \u201cdo me solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose\u201d. In September, he backtracked, saying it was the job of then-US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and president Barack Obama to sort it out. After the January trip he was questioned again about Bae, and attempted to blame Bae and his actions in North Korea for his detention. Bae\u2019s sister condemned Rodman saying: \u201cThis isn\u2019t some game. This is about a person\u2019s life \u2013 father of three, a son and a brother and a husband.\u201d",
