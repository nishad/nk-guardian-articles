    "content": "It\u2019s an odd place to screen my North Korean documentary Aim High In Creation! \u2013 a St Petersburg multiplex, with its own Starbucks and Hollywood blockbusters on fast turnaround. Vasily Koretsky, curator of the North Korean section of the St Petersburg international media forum, leads me to a cinema next to Jennifer Aniston\u2019s rom-com We\u2019re the Millers. \u201cDon\u2019t expect an audience,\u201d he warns. \u201cSince the mayor fell out with Putin, the festival\u2019s been in chaos.\u201d The forum may be chaotic, but its budget is impressive. Produced by Katya Mtsitouridze, chief executive of the state film agency Roskino, the 10-day extravaganza sees 1,200 media players converge on the old stock exchange on Vasilyevsky island to network, pitch and party. With 50 film premieres, a caviar-and-blinis-studded conference and lavish digs at the Hotel Astoria (which claims Rasputin, Thatcher and Bush are former guests), it has attracted Russian oligarchs, US heavyweights HBO and Showtime, and the French director Fran\u00e7ois Ozon. Outside the forum\u2019s cozy bubble, Vladimir Putin\u2019s hand is everywhere. Rock stars Andrei Makarevich and Diana Arbenina, both critics of the war in Ukraine, have been blacklisted: their concerts cancelled, and their names published in a Moscow tabloid alongside others \u201csupporting the Nazis in Kiev\u201d. In the Zeiferberg caf\u00e9, police have shut the \u201cSt Petersburg against homophobia\u201d concert, turning a blind eye as anti-gay radicals sprayed attendees with an \u201cunidentified\u201d gas that sent many to hospital. In tourist shops on Nevsky, busts of the president sit beside Stalin and Peter the Great. Gorbachov is absent. Aim High! is about North Korean propaganda, but it flips the mirror back on spin and censorship in the free world. To make it, I secured total access to North Korea\u2019s hidden film industry. With western newsfeeds depicting North Koreans as starving, brainwashed automatons, I sought to humanise and understand them. I\u2019ve already been savaged by the Murdoch press for \u201cfraternising with an enemy state\u201d. I\u2019m curious if the Russians will do the same. The forum website bills it as \u201ca politics-free venue, open for any discussions within the context of universal values\u201d. I ask Koretsky if this means I can mention Putin\u2019s media monopoly in my press conference. \u201cSay what you want \u2013 but If you mention Pussy Riot, they\u2019ll cut it out,\u201d Koretsky says flatly. To get Roskino\u2019s backing, he spun his North Korean program as \u201cpost-political\u201d, but talking censorship in Putin\u2019s Russia is as political as it gets. \u201cWe\u2019re on the brink of war,\u201d he explains. \u201cEveryone knows there\u2019s censorship here \u2013 just like in the west. The US media is owned by corporations who run one story; here the CEO is Putin; 80% of Russians believe in what he is doing. The idea that Ukrainians want to split off and join the EU is anathema. Putin has worked the nationalist spirit masterfully.\u201d Koretsky almost starved in the years before the USSR\u2019s collapse in 1991: his family survived on vinegared meat, sent by relatives in Ukraine. \u201cBack then, the government was stupid. Nothing worked. Now the government is still stupid but powerful and Putin has destroyed everything: my daughter\u2019s education, good health care, our ability to protest.\u201d Putin is \u201cvery cunning\u201d, Korestsky says. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t positioned the war as Russians fighting Ukrainians \u2013 we\u2019d never do that. Instead, the Ukrainian government is the enemy: it\u2019s corrupt, fascist, a \u2018Jew hater\u2019. The National Bolsheviks were censored until they said Crimea and south-east Ukraine should be part of Russia, and we must fight western imperialism. That fits Putin\u2019s agenda. So suddenly, the Bolsheviks are in the press again.\u201d Like many Putin critics, Koretsky survives by playing the system. Officially, he\u2019s a film writer for a government-friendly magazine. The pay is low but the accreditation means he can run a subversive cultural webzine, with 80,000 unique users a month. In May, Koretsky\u2019s friend, the pro-Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, was tortured for \u201cterrorism\u201d and is languishing in a Moscow jail. Koretsky is philosophical: \u201cAnyone can be accused of anything in Russia \u2013 they shoot blind. The fact I\u2019m not involved in any anti-regime activity except saying how shitty the films of [pro-Russia director] Nikita Mikhalkov are is no guarantee of safety. If they dislike you, they\u2019ll find a law to accuse you. You have no choice but not to care.\u201d At university, Koretsky hung out with leftist punks in the Juche study group. Juche is North Korea\u2019s take on Marxist-Leninism. It still has Russian fans today: among the 50 punters watching Aim High! are Vlad and Viktor, proud leaders of the National Juche Association. The film ends and we\u2019re quickly ejected to make way for How to Train Your Dragon 2. We gather at a vodka bar for a Q&amp;A, and Vlad, who\u2019s been to North Korea 12 times, buys the shots: \u201cI love your film. It\u2019s the first time a westerner has correctly positioned Juche as relevant to us all.\u201d Viktor, the only Russian to have written a biography of Kim Il Sung, says the North Korean films in Aim High! make him nostalgic for Soviet propaganda films of his youth \u2013 except they\u2019re kitschier. I ask my new comrades what they think of North Korea\u2019s notorious gulags. Vlad shrugs: \u201cThey\u2019re not what we think. People clock off and go home. They\u2019re re-education centres for those who\u2019ve lost their way.\u201d Viktor frowns: \u201cWhy are you so interested in gulags? Is it because Australia was founded on convict labour and locks up refugees? North Korea is poor. But the system works. The people are happy. We have 1,000 North Korean builders in St Petersburg. They see the flaws in our system. They go home voluntarily. One North Korean doctor was sick of getting taxis to work. He said: \u2018Fuck this, I don\u2019t care about the benefits. I\u2019m going home.\u2019 \u201d Others aren\u2019t so starry-eyed. \u201cCinema is powerful in North Korea because they have no internet. That\u2019s why their leaders are gods,\u201d says a Moscow student. \u201cBut millions support the Kims. You can\u2019t argue with the will of the people,\u201d Vlad counters. I ask if the men feel free to criticise their own leaders. Viktor is scathing: \u201cLife expectancy for Russian men is lower under Putin than under Stalin, and in North Korea. But Putin\u2019s right about Ukraine. We must protect our national identity.\u201d I look at the Starbucks logos and Tom Cruise posters, and wonder what identity is left to protect. At midnight, Koretsky takes me to a secret bar, in a crumbling tenement near St Isaac cathedral. The Jewish satirist Psoy Korolenko is wowing a glamorous crowd with subversive, high-speed raps. \u201cAll the world\u2019s a brothel, and we\u2019re all whores,\u201d he yells between saccharine renditions of the national anthem. \u201cIt\u2019s not political, but it is,\u201d Koretsky says happily. The same scenario would be unthinkable in Pyongyang. Despite Putin\u2019s stranglehold, Russians clearly still enjoy a thriving culture of resistance. But it\u2019s getting harder. In a mall outside the Akimov comedy theatre, we see a young woman holding a poster. A burly cop accosts her, then a man in a beret. They hammer her with questions \u2013 but she stands silent. \u201cYou can only picket alone,\u201d Koretsky says. \u201cIf you talk to someone, it\u2019s a \u2018riot\u2019. Without official approval, you\u2019ll be arrested.\u201d The poster has a French quote from a 1928 novel about greed in Soviet Russia. Koretsky decodes: \u201cSechin, I haven\u2019t eaten for six days.\u201d Igor Sechin leads the Kremlin\u2019s Silovoki faction of ex-KGB agents, and is one of Putin\u2019s closest allies. Ten minutes later, the brave woman is gone. \u2022 Aim High In Creation! won best film at the 2014 St Petersburg international media forum \u2013 find out more about the film here",
