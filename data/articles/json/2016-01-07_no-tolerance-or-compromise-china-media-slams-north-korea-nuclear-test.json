    "content": "Beijing should show \u201cno tolerance and compromise\u201d towards Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons programme, China\u2019s international mouthpiece said on Thursday following Kim Jong-un\u2019s unexpected nuclear test. In an editorial, the China Daily newspaper said the test \u2013 which China has said it was not told about in advance by North Korea \u2013 was \u201crisky, irresponsible and reckless\u201d. \u201cChina\u2019s foreign ministry has strongly urged the DPRK to keep its promise on denuclearisation and stop actions that will lead to the situation deteriorating,\u201d the newspaper said. \u201cThere should be no tolerance and compromise on this issue.\u201d The English language edition of the Global Times, a state-run tabloid, said Pyongyang was attempting \u201cto use nuclear deterrence to make up for its economic losses and political insecurity\u201d. \u201c[But] if Pyongyang is determined to develop its economy, it should engage with the outside world, including the west. Nuclear weapons are not the solution to its domestic woes,\u201d the newspaper argued. Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at the Renmin University in Beijing, said the test would further damage already strained relations between China and North Korea. Kim Jong-un\u2019s snub to China showed how the North Korean leader remained \u201cquite a provocative radical\u201d, he said. Zhang Liangui, a North Korea expert from the Central Party School in Beijing, told the Beijing News China was growing tired of its neighbour\u2019s \u201cbrink-of-war\u201d policy. \u201cThis policy is very dangerous,\u201d he said. But while experts say Beijing will have been furious at Kim\u2019s latest move, they also believe China will be reluctant to punish its neighbour with too much economic pressure for fear of triggering a potentially catastrophic collapse. The North Korean nuclear question was so complex that the \u201ccarrot and stick policy\u201d of sanctions and aid remained the most sensible option in the short term, argued Caixin, a respected Chinese magazine. Speaking in Beijing on Wednesday, British foreign secretary Philip Hammond recognised Chinese concerns over its renegade neighbour. \u201cThey know that if there was a meltdown on the Korean peninsula they would face potentially a very significant wave of refugees trying to move into China and the risk of instability on their borders, which they wouldn\u2019t welcome,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cSo China has a huge stake in maintaining stability on the the Korean peninsula and a huge stake in trying to find an enduring solution to the division of the Korean peninsula.\u201d China would have to play a key role in any solution to the North Korean conundrum, Hammond added. \u201cThe Chinese do have more access, I think, than any of the rest of us to North Korea and I think it is actually in the interest of the international community that somebody who is a responsible player does have some degree of access and maintains some degree of access.\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao",
