    "content": "North and South Korea have confirmed they are to field a joint women\u2019s ice hockey team and will march under a pro-unification flag at next month\u2019s Winter Olympics, in the clearest sign yet of a thaw in tensions between the two countries. The two sides are to present their plan for a \u201cpeace games\u201d to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at the weekend, following three days of talks in the border village of Panmunjom. The South Korean unification ministry said the two countries had also exchanged opinions on the size of the North Korean team, joint cultural events and the possible use of the Masikryong ski resort in North Korea. North Korea also offered to send 230 members of its all-female cheerleading squad to the Games in Pyeongchang, which open on 9 February. Reports said the delegation would probably walk across the demilitarised zone, the heavily armed border separating the two Koreas, in a highly symbolic move. Arrangements for North Korean athletes to compete in Pyeongchang have been made at breakneck speed since the start of the year, when North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, offered to send a delegation to the Games. \u201cInter-Korean relations have been strained for almost 10 years,\u201d the North\u2019s chief delegate, Jon Jong-su, said as the Panmunjom meeting started. \u201cWe hope that ties can open,\u201d he added. Three officials from each side took part in the talks and the results will be discussed by both Koreas with the IOC in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday. \u201cThis will then enable the IOC to carefully evaluate the consequences and the potential impact on the Olympic Games and the Olympic competitions,\u201d an IOC spokesperson said. \u201cThere are many considerations with regard to the impact of these proposals on the other participating NOCs [national Olympic committees] and athletes.\u201d Pyongyang and Seoul must work out how the North Korean delegation \u2013 which could comprise up to 500 athletes, cheerleaders, musicians, officials and journalists \u2013 will cross the border into South Korea, and who will pay for their accommodation and other costs. South Korea is under pressure not to agree to any proposals that could violate sanctions against the North, particularly if the delegation includes senior government officials blacklisted by UN security council measures agreed in response to Pyongyang\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear tests. The two Koreas have previously sent joint teams to major international sports events twice, both in 1991. One event was the world table tennis championships in Chiba, Japan, and the other was soccer\u2019s World Youth Championship in Portugal. During an era of detente in the 2000s, their athletes marched together during the opening and closing ceremonies of nine international sporting events, including the Olympics and Asian Games, but they failed to produce a joint team. The current mood of reconciliation began after the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said in a new year\u2019s speech that he was willing to send a delegation to the Games. Critics have said Kim\u2019s overture is an attempt to use improved ties with South Korea to weaken US-led international sanctions on North Korea while buying time to perfect his nuclear weapons programme.",
