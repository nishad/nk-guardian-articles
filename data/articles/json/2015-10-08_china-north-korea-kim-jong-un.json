    "content": "It sounds like 21st-century China: a consumer\u2019s paradise where glass skyscrapers race towards the heavens, Porsche convertibles cruise the streets and towering billboards advertise Gucci and Prada. In fact, some believe this is a vision of North Korea\u2019s future if the country\u2019s rulers resolve to follow the footsteps of their neighbours to the north. While many experts view regime collapse as the most likely \u2013 and bloody \u2013 endgame for Kim Jong-un\u2019s reign, one of the most optimistic scenarios is that North Korea may instead look to China\u2019s experience of economic reform. \u201cThat is the inevitable road that they have to take,\u201d said Paik Hak-soon, the director of the Centre for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, who believes Kim has already embarked on a gradual path of political \u2013 as well as economic \u2013 reform reminiscent of China and Vietnam in the 70s and 80s. \u201cThe die is cast. There is no way of returning,\u201d Paik said. Officials and academics in South Korea repeatedly evoke Deng Xiaoping \u2013 a charismatic pragmatist who led China out of the chaos of the Mao era and into a new period of explosive economic growth \u2013 as a potential inspiration for North Korea\u2019s young leader. In the late 70s, Deng masterminded Beijing\u2019s \u201creform and opening up\u201d, a period of economic modernisation that allowed hundreds of millions of Chinese to lift themselves from poverty and helped make their country the world\u2019s second largest economy. Moon Chung-in, a political scientist from Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University, said Pyongyang was only too aware of the need to embark on a similar process. \u201cThey want to do it. They are damn smart. They think about the regime\u2019s survival 24 hours a day, 365 days [a year],\u201d he said. But Moon cautioned against outsiders pushing North Korea towards imitating China. \u201cIf you really want to change North Korea don\u2019t use the word change. If you really want to push North Korea in the direction of opening and reform then never use \u2018opening\u2019 and \u2018reform\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have all the examples, all the models. But the very moment [someone says]: \u2018Kim Jong-un is adopting the Deng Xiaoping model,\u2019 they will stop. If they adopt the Deng Xiaoping model you simply say: \u2018That is the Kim Jong-un model. It is a good model, it is doing well.\u2019\u201d Chung Chong-Wook, who was Seoul\u2019s ambassador to Beijing from 1996 to 1998, is another for whom Chinese history provides a source of optimism. Chung said the two countries were different but, asked if Deng could be a role model for Kim Jong-un, he replied: \u201cI hope so.\u201d The former diplomat said he already saw signs that Kim was moving away from the \u201cmilitary-first\u201d policy adopted by his father, Kim Jong-il. \u201cUnder Kim Jong-un of course the nuclear priority is [still] there but the economy is also being emphasised,\u201d Chung said. \u201cI think that Kim Jong-un, as time goes on \u2026 will have to rely on the economy to support his legitimacy as the leader. I do not think that that will happen right away \u2026 it will be the same at least for many, many years to come. But the change, the shift is [there].\u201d Andrei Lankov, author of The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia, said it was his dream to see Pyongyang follow Beijing\u2019s footsteps and become a developmental dictatorship. But Lankov said Kim Jong-un would be unwise to stick too closely to Deng\u2019s rulebook for reform. For a start, North Korea\u2019s leader would have to be far more repressive than the Chinese leader, who ordered the brutal Tiananmen crackdown but nevertheless presided over a major relaxation of individual freedoms compared with the Mao era. The staggering economic gulf between North and South Korea would likely spark a popular revolt in the North if Kim relaxed his grip, Lankov argued. \u201cIf he becomes Deng Xiaoping he is going to be killed. He needs to be a cross between Deng Xiaoping and Stalin. He has to be very trigger-happy because South Korea is so damn successful. Deng Xiaoping, yes, but significantly more repressive.\u201d Paik Hak-soon said he believed Kim Jong-un had already set his country\u2019s course towards reform and opening up, pointing to the special economic zones he had established since taking power in December 2011. \u201cThe key word in North Korean society is change, change, change,\u201d Paik said. Whether Kim has already begun this transformation into a Deng with North Korean characteristics remains unclear but many believe he will ultimately have little choice. \u201cKim Jong-un could become like Deng Xiaoping,\u201d said one government adviser in Seoul. \u201cIf not he may end up like Ceau\u0219escu of Romania.\u201d",
