    "content": "North Korea has said it is considering a missile strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after Donald Trump warned the regime that any threat to the United States would be met with \u201cfire and fury\u201d. The threat, carried by the state-run KCNA news agency, marked a dramatic rise in tensions and prompted warnings to Washington not to become embroiled in a bellicose slanging match with North Korea. Pyongyang said it was \u201ccarefully examining\u201d a plan to strike Guam, located 3,400km (2,100 miles) away, and threatened to create an \u201cenveloping fire\u201d around the territory. Guam is home to a US military base that includes a submarine squadron, an airbase and a coastguard group. Guam\u2019s governor, Eddie Calvo, on Wednesday attempted to reassure residents that there was \u201cno threat\u201d of a North Korean strike, but added that the island was prepared for \u201cany eventuality\u201d. Calvo added: \u201cGuam is American soil \u2026 We are not just a military installation.\u201d In an online video message he said he had been told by the US defence and homeland security departments that there was no change in the threat level. A Korean people\u2019s army (KPA) spokesman said in a statement Wednesday that a plan would be put into practice as soon as the order to attack Guam was issued by the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. \u201cThe KPA strategic force is now carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam with medium- to long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 in order to contain the US major military bases on Guam, including the Anderson airforce base,\u201d the spokesman said. KCNA quoted a second army spokesman accusing Washington of devising a \u201cpreventive war\u201d, adding that any attempt to attack the North would provoke \u201call-out war, wiping out all the strongholds of enemies, including the US mainland\u201d. The US should cease its \u201creckless military provocation\u201d against North Korea to avoid such a reaction, the spokesman added. In response, South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, called for an overhaul of the country\u2019s armed services, citing an \u201curgent\u201d need to improve its ability to defend against North Korean missile attacks. \u201cI believe we might need a complete defence reform at the level of a rebirth, instead of making some improvements or modifications,\u201d Moon told senior military officials, according to Yonhap news agency. \u201cAnother urgent task now facing us is securing defence capabilities to counter North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile provocations.\u201d The unification ministry, which handles cross-border relations, said the threat against Guam would damage attempts to improve inter-Korean ties. A ministry spokesman said the South was committed to dialogue and sanctions, and urged Pyongyang to end its provocations. Beijing issued a brief foreign ministry statement on Wednesday calling on \u201call parties to avoid any words or actions that might escalate the situation\u201d France and Germany also called on all sides to use restraint. \u201cWe are watching the increasing rhetorical escalation regarding the Korean Peninsula with the greatest concern,\u201d German foreign ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer told reporters. Tensions in the region have risen since North Korea carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and test-launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month. The UN security council responded last weekend by unanimously agreeing sanctions designed to deprive the regime of around a billion US dollars in hard currency. North Korea\u2019s bellicose language is causing anxiety in Japan. Its defence ministry warned on Tuesday that it was possible that Pyongyang had miniaturised its nuclear weaponry. A leaked US intelligence assessment also claimed the regime had successfully produced a miniaturised nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles. Japanese fighters conducted joint air drills with US supersonic bombers near the Korean peninsula on Tuesday, Japan\u2019s air self-defence forces said. A day earlier, two US B-1 bombers flew from Guam over the Korean peninsula as part of its \u201ccontinuous bomber presence\u201d, a US official said. US security and defence officials in Guam, which is within range of North Korean medium- and long-range missiles, said there was no imminent threat to people there or elsewhere in the Northern Mariana Islands. Guam\u2019s department of homeland security and office of civil defence said they were monitoring North Korea with US military and government officials. Guam\u2019s homeland security adviser, George Charfauros, said officials were confident that the US defence department was \u201cmonitoring this situation very closely and is maintaining a condition of readiness\u201d. But the speaker of the Guam legislature, Benjamin J Cruz, said people on the island were \u201cjust praying that the United States and the \u2026 defence system we have here is sufficient enough to protect us\u201d. Cruz told the Associated Press that the threat was \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d. He added: \u201cIt forces us to pause and to say a prayer for the safety of our people.\u201d In his strongest warning yet to North Korea, Trump told reporters in New Jersey on Tuesday: \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\u201d The New Zealand prime minister condemnded Trump\u2019s comments, in an unusually strong statement. \u201cI think the comments are not helpful in an environment that is very tense,\u201d Bill English told local media. He said his government had yet to express concerns to the US administration directly, but \u201ccertainly if that type of commentary continued we would\u201d. English added: \u201cI think we are seeing reaction from North Korea that indicates that kind of comment is more likely to escalate rather than settle things.\u201d But North Korea experts played down the potential for a military strike on Guam. \u201cThere\u2019s rhetoric on both sides \u2013 it\u2019s like two bullies in the playground yelling at each other,\u201d said Robert Kelly, associate professor at Pusan National University. \u201cI think the North Koreans just pulled the Guam threat out of the air. Sure, there\u2019s some sort of rough plan on a shelf somewhere, because Guam is an important American reinforcement point, but I don\u2019t think there is anything immediately in the offing. \u201cThey just needed to say something in response \u2013 you poke the North Koreans in the eye and they poke you back.\u201d Additional reporting by Eleanor Ainge Roy and agencies",
