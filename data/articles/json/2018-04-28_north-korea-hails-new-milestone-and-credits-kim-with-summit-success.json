    "content": "North Korea has hailed its summit with the South as \u201cnew milestone\u201d in the history of the two countries after the two leaders pledged to pursue a permanent peace and rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. The official KCNA news agency carried the text of the leaders\u2019 Panmunjom declaration in full and said the encounter opened the way \u201cfor national reconciliation and unity, peace and prosperity\u201d. In flowery prose, the news agency said the meeting was \u201caccompanied by sunny April weather\u201d and \u201cborn with a new energy of endless joy and hope\u201d. A band played \u201cjolly music to heighten the welcoming atmosphere\u201d, it said. In the Panmunjom document, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the South\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, \u201cconfirmed the common goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula\u201d. Leaders from around the world welcomed the summit outcome, but analaysts warned that previous displays of inter-Korean affection and pledges by the North have come to nothing. For years, Pyongyang insisted it would never give up the \u201ctreasured sword\u201d of its nuclear arsenal, which it says it needs to defend itself against a possible US invasion. But it has offered to put it up for negotiation in exchange for security guarantees, according to Seoul \u2013 although Kim made no public reference to doing so at Friday\u2019s spectacular summit. In a separate report, KCNA said the two leaders had a \u201ccandid and open-hearted exchange of views\u201d on issues including \u201censuring peace on the Korean peninsula and the denuclearisation of the peninsula\u201d. The Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the mouthpiece of the North\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 party, devoted the first four of its six pages to the event, carrying a total of 60 photos, 15 of them on page one. When Kim stepped over the military demarcation line that divides the peninsula he became the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean war hostilities ceased in 1953 with an armistice rather than a peace treaty. He then persuaded Moon to step into the North \u2013 a fact reported by KCNA on Saturday \u2013 and the two leaders shared a day of smiles, intimate moments and a half-hour-long one-on-one conversation. The North has made rapid progress in its weapons programmes under Kim, detonating its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last year and launching missiles capable of reaching the US mainland, in moves that triggered increasingly strict UN security council sanctions against the regime. Kim and the US president, Donald Trump, traded personal insults and threats of war, sending tensions soaring before Moon seized on the Winter Olympics to broker dialogue, beginning a dizzying whirl of diplomacy that led to Friday\u2019s meeting in the demilitarised zone between the two countries. Analysts and diplomats say that a combination of factors were behind Pyongyang\u2019s change of heart, including feeling that it was in a position to negotiate from strength, the looming impact of sanctions and fear of potential US military action. But KCNA gave Kim the credit. \u201cThe historic meeting at Panmunjom came to be realised thanks to the supreme leader\u2019s ardent love for the people and will for self-determination\u201d independent of outside influence, it said. Washington is pressing Pyongyang to give up its weapons in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way, and analysts say that meaningful progress will depend on the outcome of Kim\u2019s much-anticipated summit with Trump in the coming weeks. Trump hailed the Korea summit as historic, but warned \u201conly time will tell\u201d.",
