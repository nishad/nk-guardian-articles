    "content": "In the wake of North Korea\u2019s sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date, the US has called for the toughest possible sanctions at the United Nations and said there are ample military options on the table. Experts warn that there are few good options the US can take without assistance from China, which has been wary of pushing the North Korean regime to the brink of collapse. China has advocated a freeze on development of the North\u2019s nuclear program in return for an end to joint US-South Korea military exercises, an idea the US has rejected. Donald Trump has floated three ideas as a candidate and later US president to deal with the crisis: military strikes, punishing China economically and direct talks. War US defence secretary James Mattis warned earlier this week of \u201ca massive military response\u201d to any threat from North Korea against the US or its allies, and Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the UN, accused leader Kim Jong-un of \u201cbegging for war\u201d. \u201cKim Jong-un doesn\u2019t want to talk: he wants to develop the economy and a nuclear arsenal, not one or the other but both at the same time,\u201d said Park Byung-kwang, director of centre for north-east Asia at the Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul, a thinktank affiliated with the country\u2019s intelligence agency. \u201cThe crisis on the Korean peninsula is getting worse, which means the likelihood of Trump exerting more pressure and even [a] military strike is becoming more feasible.\u201d According to Park, Trump has three options: ratcheting up pressure through sanctions, starting a direct dialogue with Kim or considering surgical strikes on North Korean military facilities. But it remains uncertain if Trump would coordinate with South Korea and Japan, two important US allies in the region, ahead of a military strike. Both countries would likely vehemently oppose attacking North Korea, Park said, given that their citizens are most likely to die in any conflict. Talk of war could bolster Kim\u2019s position in the short term. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s sabre-rattling plays into Kim\u2019s logic of domestic power that positions the US as a dire threat, justifying the regime\u2019s political repression,\u201d according to Benjamin Habib, a politics professor at La Trobe University. \u201cOne could be forgiven for observing the current US-North Korea standoff as a game played by privileged men in suits on either side, gambling with the lives of ordinary citizens,\u201d he added. \u201cMillions of lives on both sides of the demilitarised zone and beyond are placed at unnecessary risk through such high-stakes brinkmanship. \u201cTrump\u2019s penchant for military posturing does little to increase the likelihood of denuclearising North Korea.\u201d Military action could also draw China into a conflict. Beijing is opposed to North Korea\u2019s nuclear program but does not want to see the Kim regime collapse. China sent more than a million troops to fight in the 1950-1953 Korean war, which is still officially known there as the \u201cwar to resist US aggression and aid Korea\u201d. Tariffs on China China is North Korea\u2019s most important ally and largest trading partner, accounting for 90% of its foreign trade. The isolated country exported $2.3bn in goods to China in 2015, while the second biggest destination \u2013 India \u2013 bought only $98m, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Imports into North Korea follow a similar pattern. But despite Trump\u2019s threat to stop \u201call trade with any country doing business with North Korea\u201d, China is also the US\u2019s largest trading partner, and banning trade with the country would likely require an act of Congress. Trump does have the power to impose tariffs that would make importing Chinese goods prohibitively expensive, but experts warn that could set off a trade war that ultimately harms US consumers. \u201cIt may be that [Trump] thinks that being able to say that such tariffs have been imposed for reasons of national security, such as a response to the threats posed by North Korea, it will mean that they will be subject to less criticism,\u201d said Saul Eslake, an independent economist who has consulted the Australian government on trade. \u201cOther options include denying access to the US capital markets, or to the use of the US dollar, or to travel to the United States, and exerting pressure on US allies, including Australia, to impose similar measures,\u201d he added. \u201cLike tariffs, though even more so, measures such as these would cause more harm to the US than to China.\u201d Tariffs would increase the cost of goods almost overnight, hitting low-income and industrial consumers the hardest. \u201cThere are very few avenues for the US to exert pressure on North Korea, other than to make threats of military action, and perhaps even to carry them out,\u201d Eslake said. China is also the largest holder of US debt, giving it significant leverage if it decides to sell en masse. \u201cRisking global recession through a foolish protectionist spiral or forcing China to drop the \u2018dollar bomb\u2019 is not a credible strategy for soliciting Chinese assistance with handling North Korea,\u201d Habib has written. Direct negotiations Most experts agree that North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons. Kim is aware that Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi relinquished his nuclear programme in 2003 only to have US and European forces aid an insurrection against him less than a decade later. Shen Dingli, head of the Centre for American Studies at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, said he believed both China and the US now needed to accept North Korea\u2019s status as a nuclear power and normalise relations with Pyongyang. Shen pointed out that Richard Nixon had reestablished ties with Mao Zedong during the early 1970s, just a few years after China\u2019s first nuclear test, and said Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping now needed to do the same with Kim. \u201cNixon hated China, he never liked China. It was a Communist country staging the Cultural Revolution. But Nixon was smart. He needed China to counter the Soviet Union,\u201d Shen said. \u201cThe US had to live with China\u2019s nuclear weapons peacefully. China has to live with North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons peacefully, rather than opposing it, which is destined to fail.\u201d Shen predicted Trump would soon realise he had no choice but to sit down with Kim just as Nixon sat down with Mao. \u201cTrump is a smart man \u2026 He will be the first US president to accept North Korea.\u201d",
