    "content": "Plans are being drawn up to evacuate British athletes from the Winter Olympics in South Korea if there is an escalation in tensions between North Korea and the west. The British Olympic Association is \u201cworking on all possible contingency plans\u201d because of the deteriorating situation in the region. Its assessment came hours before a North Korean official warned the world should take Kim Jong-un\u2019s threat to detonate a nuclear device above ground \u201cliterally\u201d. With Donald Trump also threatening to unleash \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d on North Korea, British officials are aware they must take precautions \u2013 especially given Pyeongchang, where the Winter Olympics will be staged in February, is only 65km from the demilitarised zone that separates South Korea from its neighbour. Bill Sweeney, the chief executive of the BOA, said: \u201cWe are working on all possible contingency plans. We will go there with a clearly laid-out evacuation plan if it is necessary. I don\u2019t think it will be necessary but the health and welfare of the delegation is our No1 priority. We will do everything possible around the issue.\u201d Sweeney insisted Pyeongchang is still a safe place for the Games, based on the latest Foreign Office advice. \u201cClearly there is an issue around the escalation of tensions between North and South Korea and the Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I lost a lot more sleep going to Rio than I do Pyeongchang. The security threat in Rio was a lot more personal, a lot more unpredictable. We were prepared against any opportunity around mugging and crime and the violent nature of Rio.\u201d The Team GB chef de mission, Mike Hay, said British athletes were regularly being updated with the situation on a special Facebook page but stressed no one is considering pulling out. \u201cIt\u2019s the pinnacle of an athlete\u2019s career so it would be a very big decision to decide not to go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly felt very safe on a visit last week. We are conscious it\u2019s 65km from the DMZ but everything seemed really good.\u201d Sweeney, meanwhile, has urged the International Olympic Committee to implement urgently \u201cmeaningful sanctions\u201d on Russia following last year\u2019s McLaren report that revealed how the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 had been corrupted by Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping. He said: \u201cThere is nothing more disheartening than preparing and finding you are up against people who are cheating the system. Our priority is to have a level playing field for our athletes. We want meaningful sanctions and for it to be decided and confirmed as soon as possible, and certainly before Christmas.\u201d Sweeney stopped short of saying what sanctions should be imposed but added: \u201cMcLaren and a number of other people have said it was a very wide state-sponsored system and we have all watched Icarus [the Netflix documentary]. I\u2019ve done so three times. And we don\u2019t want the same situation that occurred in Rio with four or five days to go, wandering around the village, wondering if the Russians are going to be there or not.\u201d Sweeney also insisted the British Bobsleigh coach Lee Johnson, who the Guardian revealed this month had said \u201cblack drivers do not make good bobsleigh drivers\u201d back in 2013, retained the support of the team. \u201cYou have had a number of departures from bobsleigh,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cThe CEO, Richard Parker, has gone. The performance director has gone. The team leader has gone. There are new people in place. \u201cThere has been a lot of comment around Lee Johnson and some of the remarks he made. He has the support of the athletes going out to Pyeongchang. When we get there he comes under our jurisdiction and we will manage it that way. Everything that has been need to be done in bobsleigh has been done.\u201d Hay confirmed the BOA will have a welfare officer at the Games for the first time to address any problems that athletes or staff might raise. \u201cWe\u2019ve had psychologists and people like that before but this is somebody who both HQ staff and athletes can approach for whatever reason,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that we will take into future Games as well, I\u2019m sure.\u201d",
