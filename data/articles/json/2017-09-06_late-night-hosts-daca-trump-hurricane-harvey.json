    "content": "Late-night hosts on Tuesday addressed Donald Trump\u2019s controversial decision to rescind the \u201cDreamers\u201d program, protecting the children of illegal immigrants, as well as his fumbling response to Hurricane Harvey and the administration\u2019s continued saber-rattling with regard to the North Korean nuclear threat. \u201cWhile Harvey\u2019s a natural disaster that seems to be bringing people together in very heartwarming ways, there\u2019s a manmade disaster unfolding in Washington right now because the Trump administration has announced they\u2019re ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or Daca,\u201d Stephen Colbert began. \u201cThe thing is, the vast majority of Americans like this program, so by canceling it Trump has stepped in some steep Daca,\u201d he continued. \u201cEven though his decision is unpopular, Trump bravely stepped up, then cringed back, and had somebody else announce it. That someone was attorney general and turnip-that-learned-to-hate Jeff Sessions.\u201d Colbert showed footage of the press conference in which Sessions said the Dreamers weren\u2019t \u201cbad people\u201d and that the decision to end the program was not meant to \u201cdisrespect\u201d or \u201cdemean\u201d them. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Jeff,\u201d Colbert quipped. \u201cDeporting innocent children does not mean they\u2019re bad people. It means you\u2019re a bad person.\u201d He went on: \u201cThese Dreamers, they aren\u2019t the only ones being hurt. In fact, a recent study estimated that terminating Daca would cost the federal government $60bn and reduce economic growth by $280bn in the next ten years. Wow, Trump really is a dealmaker.\u201d Colbert then did his best impression of Trump, mocking his negotiating tactics: \u201cI\u2019ll trade you 800,000 productive young people and, wait, $280bn, for nothing. Final offer.\u201d Seth Meyers also addressed the president\u2019s decision to terminate the program, but began by discussing Trump\u2019s response to the tragedies afflicting Houston in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. He said: \u201cOn top of everything else he\u2019ll face in the next several months \u2013 the budget, the debt limit, North Korea\u2019s nuclear program \u2013 Trump has had to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.\u201d \u201cTo be fair to Trump, we don\u2019t need elbow grease from our president in times of tragedy,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cWe need their inspirational words, but even there, Trump wasn\u2019t quite up to the task.\u201d Meyers then showed clips of the president making a speech in Houston, mentioning the \u201cgreat turnout\u201d and thanking people for coming to see him. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?,\u201d Meyers asked. \u201cYou\u2019re the president, not a standup comic. But of course, as quick as he was to praise himself, Trump is even quicker to needlessly attack others, as he did on Saturday when he was praising emergency responders for their heroic work and, out of nowhere, took this false, gratuitous swipe at the media.\u201d Trump, in a clip that aired on television, said responders had gone into the winds the media was not willing to confront. \u201cOf course, the media was on those choppers with the coast guard during many of those rescues, which is why you saw those rescues on the news,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cAnd the coast guard and the media weren\u2019t the only ones braving dangerous conditions to save lives. There were also countless emergency responders like Houston-area paramedic Jesus Contreras. Contreras is protected from deportation under the Obama-era program known as Daca. He spent six straight days rescuing people from floodwaters in Houston, so how did the president thank him?\u201d \u201cWell, today Trump announced that he was rescinding Daca, supposedly with a six-month delay to allow Congress to pass legislation to replace it,\u201d Meyers explained. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision throws the lives of nearly 800,000 Americans who were brought here as children, and who work here and go to school here, into chaos.\u201d Meyers continued: \u201cTo be clear, Daca recipients were brought here as children, have known no other country, pay taxes, have no criminal record, and are as American as anyone else living here.\u201d \u201cSo, a president who backed himself into a corner by catering to the racial resentments of his base is now needlessly throwing the lives of hundreds of thousands of hardworking Americans into chaos,\u201d Meyers said. Trevor Noah also discussed some of the latest news coming out of the White House, principally North Korea\u2019s escalating nuclear program and the response to it from representatives of the administration. \u201cYou know that saying: find something you love and do it as much as possible,\u201d Noah began. \u201cWell, North Korea\u2019s problem is that what they love doing is testing nuclear weapons.\u201d He showed cable news coverage explaining that the country\u2019s most recent nuclear test was its sixth, amplifying international concerns about Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear capabilities. \u201cThe whole thing that the world has spent the last 25 years to prevent North Korea from getting, now it has,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBoth a missile that can reach the United States and a thermonuclear bomb, a bomb more powerful than Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.\u201d \u201cNow, coming after multiple warnings from the White House to cut this shit out, North Korea\u2019s new nuclear test was a huge provocation,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd the Trump team got bigly provoked.\u201d Noah showed a speech given by the US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, in which she said North Korea was asking for war. He also aired footage of the defense secretary, James Mattis, stating that, while it did not intend to do so, the US had the ability to annihilate North Korea. \u201cBut look, there\u2019s no need to freak out,\u201d the host added. \u201cThat\u2019s just the United Nations person and the Pentagon guy. The real time to panic is when you hear saber-rattling from the commander-in-chief. So I guess what I\u2019m saying is: panic.\u201d Noah showed a brief clip in which a reporter asked Trump if he planned to attack North Korea, to which he responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see? Dude, you don\u2019t Ryan Seacrest nuclear war! Will the planet be consumed in a radioactive hellfire, or will Fantasia take home this season\u2019s crown?\u201d Noah joked. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d",
