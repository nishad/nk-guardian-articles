    "content": "The potential of a US war with North Korea is growing each day, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser said on Saturday. Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California, HR McMaster said North Korea is \u201cthe greatest immediate threat to the United States\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s increasing every day, which means that we are in a race, really, we are in a race to be able to solve this problem,\u201d he said. Asked about North Korea\u2019s latest ballistic missile test this week, McMaster said US president Donald Trump is committed to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. McMaster said China could impose more stringent economic sanctions against North Korea, saying it has \u201ctremendous coercive economic power\u201d over Pyongyang. \u201cThere are ways to address this problem short of armed conflict, but it is a race because [Kim Jong-un\u2019s] getting closer and closer, and there\u2019s not much time left,\u201d CNN reports McMaster said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking China not to do us or anybody else a favour,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking China to act in China\u2019s interest, as they should, and we believe increasingly that it\u2019s in China\u2019s urgent interest to do more.\u201d McMaster said China should cut off North Korean oil imports: \u201cYou can\u2019t shoot a missile without fuel.\u201d He added that both he and Trump felt a 100% oil embargo would \u201cbe appropriate at this point\u201d. He said Kim was unlikely to scale back on his missile program \u201cwithout some significant new actions in the form of much more severe sanctions\u201d and \u201ccomplete enforcement of the sanctions that are in place\u201d. The agency tasked with protecting the US from missile attacks is scouting the west coast for places to deploy new anti-missile defences, two congressmen said, as North Korea\u2019s missile tests raise concerns about how the country would defend itself from an attack. West coast defences would probably include Terminal High Altitude Area Defence anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack. Congressman Mike Rogers, who sits on the house armed services committee and chairs the strategic forces subcommittee which oversees missile defence, said the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), was aiming to install extra defences at west coast sites. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of the location, and the MDA making a recommendation as to which site meets their criteria for location, but also the environmental impact,\u201d the Alabama congressman and Republican said during an interview on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum. In North Korea, Kim thanked workers during a visit to the factory that built the tires for a huge vehicle used to transport the new intercontinental ballistic missile test-launched on Tuesday. The launch of the Hwasong-15 ICBM in violation of international sanctions was celebrated on Friday with a huge public rally and fireworks in Pyongyang. At the factory, Kim complimented workers for manufacturing the tires for the nine-axle missile truck without relying on imported equipment. He also called for efforts to raise production to \u201csatisfy the daily-increasing needs in developing the country\u2019s economy and beefing up national defence capabilities,\u201d the North\u2019s official news agency reported. Kim in September tasked the Amnokgang tire factory to make the tires for the \u201cgreat event in November,\u201d it said. South Korea\u2019s military believes the latest missile, which flew 950km (600 miles) before splashing down in waters near Japan, is potentially capable of striking targets as far as 13,000km, which would put Washington within reach.
