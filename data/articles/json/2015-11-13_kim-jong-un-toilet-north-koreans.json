    "content": "North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un travels with a mobile toilet built into one of the vehicles in his convoy when he conducts routine inspections of military bases and state-run factories around the country, according to sources close to his personal guards. \u201cThe restrooms are not only in Kim Jong-un\u2019s personal train but whatever small or midsize cars he is traveling with and even in special vehicles that are designed for mountainous terrain or snow,\u201d said a source in South Pyongan province, who is close to the Escort Command tasked with guarding the leader. \u201cThere are multiple vehicles within the convoy so that people cannot tell which one he is in, and there is a separate car that acts as his restroom.\u201d The claim was corroborated by another source close to Kim\u2019s Escort Command. \u201cHe has to travel around the entire country for field guidance, so there always needs to be a personal restroom exclusively for the Suryeong [Supreme Leader] Kim Jong-un,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt is unthinkable in a Suryeong-based society for him to have to use a public restroom just because he travels around the country.\u201d Even high-ranking North Korean officials such as Hwang Pyong-so, the director of the Korean People\u2019s Army general political bureau, would face severe punishment, even death, if he was found using Kim\u2019s personal facilities, the source said. \u201cIn the North, the leader\u2019s restroom needs are managed by the Escort Command, which oversees the personal safety of the leader and the Kim family,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t use the bathroom as he would in the morning or if he needs to go while traveling, it requires additional security protocol for command soldiers, and when traveling on the highway in his Mercedes, he is said to have a separate chamber pot in the car that he can use.\u201d The source went on to explain that all events involving the leader required elaborate preparations, including his use of the restroom. Because the matter requires absolute secrecy, this can be one of the most challenging and sensitive issues for members of the Escort Command. Such is the personality cult surrounding North Korea\u2019s Kim dynasty that the state has claimed in the past that the leaders have magical powers and do not need to use the toilet.
