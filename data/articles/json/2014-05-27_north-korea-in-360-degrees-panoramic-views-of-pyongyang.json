    "content": "Singapore-based photographer Aram Pan is providing a new way of looking at North Korea through some spectacular panoramic images and videos of the country. Pan has just arrived back from his latest trip to Pyongyang and has already posted a panorama from Mansudae hill and a night one of Kim Il-sung square. Highlights from his previous visits include this one inside Puhung metro station. Pan said the project began when he started emailing and faxing North Korean embassies and organisations for permission \u2013 \"and one day someone replied\". \u201cI\u2019ve heard that it ranged from difficult to impossible for journalists and photographers to do something even remotely similar so I have no idea how everything fell into place,\u201d said Pan. \u201cI wasn\u2019t some basketball star or Google CEO\u2026 I\u2019m just a regular photographer\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s luck, maybe someone likes my portfolio? No idea man.\u201d He took a Nikon D800 and a D7000 on the trip, taking still photographs as well. \u201cYou don\u2019t need specialised cameras to shoot great panoramas at all. In fact, even a cheap DSLR in the right hands produces far better panoramas than anything those expensive Google street view systems can achieve. You really can\u2019t ever take the photographer out of the equation when it comes to good image capturing.\u201d He\u2019s also taken a Ricoh Theta \u2013 a small, handheld panorama camera. Pan also filmed inside the Munsu Water Park in Pyongyang... ... and attached a GoPro camera to the front windshield of a car for a 22-minute trip through Pyongyang. He\u2019s also taken a Ricoh Theta \u2013 a small, handheld panorama camera. Pan also attached a GoPro camera to the front windshield of a car for a 22-minute trip through Pyongyang. \"My guides did the explaining to the driver after I explained to them so there wasn\u2019t any issue sticking the GoPro to the windscreen of the car,\u201d he said. As for what\u2019s next, Pan said he still has images from his most recent trip that are waiting to be processed and posted on his DPRK 360 website. \u201cI\u2019ve used the GoPro in North Korea for horseback riding, general video capture and swimming with the locals,\u201d he said. \u201cYup. I went swimming in their public pool. I\u2019ll be publishing that video later on.\u201d Other favourites from his earlier work include: \u2022 Arirang games \u2022 Juche Tower floating \u2022 Mangyongdae children's palace \u2022 Panmunjom \u2013 the north side of the DMZ \u2022 Koryo history museum",
