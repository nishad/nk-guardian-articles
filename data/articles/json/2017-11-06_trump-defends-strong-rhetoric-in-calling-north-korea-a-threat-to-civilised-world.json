    "content": "Donald Trump has said large Japanese orders for US-made military equipment will help it counter the threat from North Korean ballistic missiles, as he called the regime a \u201cthreat to the civilised world\u201d on the second day of his tour of Asia. North Korea has test-launched two missiles over the Japanese island of Hokkaido in recent months and threatened to \u201csink\u201d Japan into the sea. Trump, at a press conference in Tokyo with Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, said Japan should have shot down the missiles, and that buying missile defences would boost both the US economy and Japanese security. \u201c[Abe] will shoot missiles out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of equipment from the United States,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOne very important thing is that Prime Minister Abe is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. \u201cWe make the best by far \u2026 it\u2019s a lot of jobs for us, and a lot of safety for Japan.\u201d Trump said the US would consider all options, including military force, to counter North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, and defended his occasionally provocative choice of words to describe its leader, Kim Jong-un. Trump has referred to Kim as \u201clittle rocket man\u201d and threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d his country if the US and its allies are forced to defend themselves. \u201cSome people say my rhetoric is very strong, but look what has happened with very weak rhetoric in the last 25 years,\u201d Trump said, declaring that the era of strategic patience favoured by previous US administrations was over. Abe, who has been unwavering in his support of Trump\u2019s line on the nuclear crisis, noted that previous efforts to strike deals with the regime in Pyongyang had failed. \u201cEach time, North Korea broke its promises and bought itself time to continue developing nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be no talks for talks\u2019 sake. Now is the time for Japan and the US to exert maximum pressure on North Korea, using all possible means.\u201d Abe said he welcomed the stronger pressure being applied by China after sanctions were agreed by the UN security council, adding: \u201cIt is incumbent on China to play a greater role in getting North Korea to end its development of nuclear weapons. \u201cJapan supports President Trump when he says that all options are on the table. I reaffirmed [to Trump] that the US and Japan are 100% together.\u201d The former US Secretary of State, John Kerry, on Monday warned that Trump\u2019s personalisation of the dispute with Kim had only served to harden positions and make a settlement harder to reach. Speaking at Chatham House in London, Kerry, the top diplomat in the second term of the Obama administration, said Trump had given North Korea a good reason to keep nuclear weapons by threatening in an address to the United Nations in September to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the country. \u201cWe would be greatly helped by not having a personal Twitter war that could make it far more dangerous,\u201d Kerry said. Insisting diplomacy is not exhausted, he urged Trump to persuade China when he arrives in Beijing later this week that it has many options for putting pressure on North Korea to come to the negotiating table and agree a freeze in military activity on both sides. \u201c100% of the fuel that drives every car, every truck, every aeroplane comes from China and 100% of the banking, such as it is, that North Korea is able to effect, comes from Beijing,\u201d he said. \u201cBeijing has every possibility in the world to put greater pressure on North Korea. Some people say they are worried about the implosion of the regime, and the stability of the peninsula. We are not close to the point of implosion. China has many tools available in its tool box to put on pressure.\u201d After months of ruling out engagement, Trump suggested on Sunday he would be open to talks with Kim. \u201cI would sit down with anybody. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s strength or weakness, I think sitting down with people is not a bad thing,\u201d he said in a television interview. \u201cSo I would certainly be open to doing that but we\u2019ll see where it goes, I think we\u2019re far too early.\u201d North Korea responded with another personal attack on Trump, whom Kim in September labelled a \u201crogue\u201d and a \u201cdotard\u201d. The Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers\u2019 party, called the US president the \u201clunatic old man of the White House\u201d and said there was no telling when he would trigger a nuclear war. Trump and Abe earlier on Monday met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean spies during the 1970s and 80s. \u201cWe\u2019ve just heard the very sad stories about family members, daughters, wives, brothers, uncles, fathers \u2013 it\u2019s a very, very sad number of stories that we\u2019ve heard,\u201d Trump said. The relatives included Sakie Yokota, the mother of Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she was snatched and taken to North Korea in 1977. \u201cNo child should ever be subjected to such cruelty, and no parent should ever have to endure 40 years of heartbreak,\u201d Trump said. Five of 17 people officially listed as abductees by the Japanese government were allowed to return in 2002 after a summit in Pyongyang between the then Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. North Korea claimed at the time that eight of the remaining abductees had died and four had never entered the country. \u201cIt would be a tremendous symbol if Kim Jong-un sent [the rest of them] back,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat could be the start of something special if he did that. The families think they\u2019re alive but they don\u2019t know \u2026 it probably makes it tougher that way.\u201d Abe, who has been involved in the abduction issue for much of his political career, said he would not rest until the waiting families \u201ccan hold their sons, daughters and relatives in their arms\u201d.",
