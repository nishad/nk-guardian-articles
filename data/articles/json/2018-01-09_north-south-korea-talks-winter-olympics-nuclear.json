    "content": "North Korea is to send athletes and cheerleaders to next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in South Korea after the two countries ended their first official talks for more than two years. The agreement represents a cautious diplomatic breakthrough after months of rising tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme and came with a pledge to reopen a military hotline and hold further talks to reduce the chances of a conflict breaking out due to an accident or miscalculation South Korea said Seoul would temporarily lift sanctions to allow the North to attend the Pyeongchang Games, which open on 9 February, and proposed that the two Koreas march together during the opening and closing ceremonies. The North said its delegation would include athletes, high-ranking officials, a cheering squad, art performers, reporters and spectators. South Korea\u2019s unification minister, Cho Myoung-gyon, said Seoul believed \u201cguests from the North are going to join many others from all around the world\u201d at Pyeongchang. \u201cThe people have a strong desire to see the North and South move towards peace and reconciliation,\u201d he said. The North, however, said it would not discuss its nuclear weapons in coming talks with Seoul because they were aimed only at the US, not its \u201cbrethren\u201d in South Korea. In a joint statement after 11 hours of talks, the North made a \u201cstrong complaint\u201d after Seoul proposed talks to denuclearise the Korean peninsula. \u201cAll our weapons including atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs and ballistic missiles are only aimed at the United States, not our brethren, nor China and Russia,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis is not a matter between North and South Korea, and to bring up this issue would cause negative consequences and risks turning all of today\u2019s good achievement into nothing.\u201d The South\u2019s unification ministry said in a separate statement: \u201cWe will closely coordinate with the United States, China, Japan and other neighbours in this process.\u201d The North Korean delegation travelled to the border in a motorcade and then walked across the military demarcation line into the southern side of the truce village of Panmunjom at about 9.30am local time. The village straddles the demilitarised zone (DMZ), the heavily armed border that has separated the two Koreas for more than six decades. \u201cLet\u2019s present the people with a precious new year\u2019s gift,\u201d said Ri Son-gwon, the chairman of the North\u2019s committee for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and head of the country\u2019s delegation. \u201cThere is a saying that a journey taken by two lasts longer than the one travelled alone.\u201d But as the two sides sat down for their first face-to-face talks since December 2015, North Korean media hit back at Donald Trump\u2019s claim that his tough stance against Pyongyang had facilitated the Olympic negotiations. The Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers\u2019 party, said the US president\u2019s claim that sanctions and pressure on the regime had brought him \u201cdiplomatic success\u201d during his first year in the White House was \u201cridiculous sophism\u201d. Discussions focused on North Korean participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Games, but included other inter-Korean issues such as the resumption of reunions between family members who were separated at the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. South Korea has suggested holding reunions during the Lunar new year holidays next month. The two sides will have to work out details such as the size of the North Korean delegation, which is expected to be dominated by members of the country\u2019s female cheerleading group. The North Korean party could spend the Games staying on a cruise ship in Sokcho, about an hour\u2019s drive from the Olympic venue, enabling the hosts to closely monitor their guests. South Korean media said the delegation could include Kim Yo-Jong, the younger sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in her capacity as a senior official in the ruling party. South Korea risks angering the US and Japan, however, if, as some have speculated, it has to lift travel bans against several North Korean officials who plan to attend the Games. A foreign ministry spokesman said Seoul would take \u201cprior steps\u201d in tandem with the UN security council to allow the officials to cross the border. China\u2019s foreign ministry said it was \u201cpleased to see this high-level talk between the two sides, while a Kremlin spokesman said: \u201cThis is exactly the kind of dialogue that we said was necessary.\u201d The two Koreas previously made joint entrances to Olympics opening and closing ceremonies in Sydney in 2000, Athens in 2004 and at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin. Preparation for the resumption of high-level dialogue \u2013 albeit focusing on sport rather than security \u2013 have proceeded at breakneck speed since New Year\u2019s Day, when Kim Jong-un said he was willing to discuss North Korean participation in the Games. That was quickly followed by the reopening of a cross-border hotline that had not been used for almost two years. The North agreed to meet on Tuesday after Seoul and Washington said they would delay joint military exercises until after the Winter Paralympics end on 18 March. North Korea regards the drills, which the allies say are designed to demonstrate their overwhelming conventional firepower, as a rehearsal for an invasion and has often cited them as an obstacle to dialogue. Katina Adams, a spokeswoman for the US state department, did not respond directly to suggestions that the two Koreas could march under a single flag at the Pyeongchang opening ceremony and possibly compete as a single nation in some events. The US, Adams said, remained \u201cclear-eyed about [North Korea\u2019s] track record when it comes to negotiations\u201d, and added: \u201cTime will tell if this is a genuine gesture.\u201d",
