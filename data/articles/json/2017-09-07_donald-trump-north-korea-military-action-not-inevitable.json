    "content": "Donald Trump said military action against North Korea was not \u201cinevitable\u201d in a foreign policy focused press conference with the emir of Kuwait. Trump also told reporters \u201cwe have very little to do in Syria but kill Isis\u201d and expressed caution about success in the push for the Israel-Palestinian peace process. Just a few days after North Korea tested a hydrogen bomb, Trump made clear again that \u201cmilitary action would certainly be an option\u201d to deal with the crisis on the Korean peninsula. However, he said \u201cnothing\u2019s inevitable\u201d and stated: \u201cI would prefer not going the route of military.\u201d Trump did make clear that if military force was used \u201cit will be a very sad day for North Korea\u201d. The comments came as Trump has continued diplomatic efforts to encourage China, North Korea\u2019s number one trade partner, to pressure the rogue regime to end its development of intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as its nuclear program. However, when asked if he was willing to tolerate a nuclear but contained North Korea, Trump said he would not negotiate with reporters . Trump also expressed caution about prospects for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Although he boasted about the \u201ctremendous talent working on that particular transaction\u201d, he once again called it the world\u2019s most complex and difficult deal. In Trump\u2019s opinion there was some hope for a deal. \u201cI think the Palestinians would like it happen and the Israelis would like to see it happen and when you have two groups that would like to see things happen, good things happen.\u201d However, he then added: \u201cI think there is a chance there could be peace but then again, I say that a little bit reluctantly.\u201d The president also weighed in on several other Middle Eastern conflicts during the press conference. Of the Syrian civil war, Trump said: \u201cWe have very little to do with Syria other than killing Isis.\u201d He went to brag that his administration had been more successful in the conflict against Isis in eight months than Barack Obama had in years. Trump also proclaimed his willingness to personally mediate the crisis between gulf countries and Qatar. \u201cI will be a mediator here in the White House,\u201d Trump said of the conflict, which has led Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to cut ties with Qatar.",
