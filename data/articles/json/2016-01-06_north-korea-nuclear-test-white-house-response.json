    "content": "Barack Obama\u2019s administration has greeted North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test in a decade with the same mix of condemnation, exasperation and pleas for collective action prompted by Pyongyang\u2019s previous nuclear detonations. Once again, US officials said they refused to accept North Korea as a nuclear state \u2013 even though two decades of diplomacy, sanctions, and threats have failed to reverse the country\u2019s nuclear programme. An emergency meeting of the UN security council is expected to add economic sanctions atop longstanding ones intended to punish Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear violations. A senior US State Department official said: \u201cWe would like to see additional sanctions that are very tough to continue to hold this regime to account.\u201d The now-familiar response \u2013 accompanied by similarly routine Republican calls for a harsher reaction \u2013 came as the White House echoed skepticism among independent experts that Pyongyang had indeed detonated a hydrogen bomb, a far more powerful weapon than its arsenal has previously possessed. But White House press secretary Josh Earnest signalled that the US is unlikely to veer from the policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d that Obama has adopted since North Korea carried out a nuclear test four months after he came into office. Washington has been unwilling to make concessions and held out for Pyongyang to make the first move, but economy-crippling sanctions appear to have little impact on the leadership. \u201cThere is only one path out of the extreme poverty and isolation that they currently face and it\u2019s not a path that is advanced by pursuing nuclear weapons,\u201d Earnest said. Though some might argue that horse has already bolted, the US continues to guard the stable door. John Kerry, the secretary of state, said: \u201cWe do not and will not accept North Korea as a nuclear armed state, and actions such as this latest test only strengthen our resolve.\u201d At a State Department press briefing, spokesperson John Kirby was asked if such a position is \u201cfantasy\u201d considering North Korea\u2019s known nuclear capabilities. \u201cI would challenge this idea that it\u2019s a fantasy,\u201d he replied. \u201cAt this level of foreign policy, you have to make choices. You don\u2019t have to accept everything even at face value. We are not going to accept North Korea as a nuclear armed state; we\u2019re not going to recognise that. We are, however, going to deal with their efforts at developing that programme.\u201d Kirby called for a response that is \u201cmeasured, deliberate, tough, clear, concise and multinational and international in scope. Screaming and yelling about it isn\u2019t going to solve it.\u201d He also denied the tests had any implications for the multinational nuclear deal reached with Iran last July. \u201cIt was different with Iran. Iran showed an interest. Sanctions had an effect and brought them to the table.\u201d Ashton Carter, the US defense chief, did not reprise the call for a pre-emptive strike on the North that he sounded during George W Bush\u2019s administration, instead calling his South Korean counterpart, Han Min-koo, to pledge solidarity with Seoul and vow \u201cappropriate alliance responses to these provocations\u201d. But the Pentagon offered no elaboration on any steps it might take. As with previous verification efforts, US air force surveillance planes are expected to contribute to an assessment of what North Korea has detonated. The politicians running to succeed Obama in the White House seized on the test to showcase their approaches to foreign policy. Hillary Clinton urged imposing additional multilateral sanctions \u201cimmediately\u201d, advocated strengthening missile defenses, and urged a more \u201cassertive\u201d Chinese response. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, rival candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, both described the test as the fruit of a failed \u201cObama-Clinton foreign policy\u201d, though neither offered details of alternative strategies to deal with North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Congressional reaction by party elder statesmen on the security-focused committees followed predictable lines as well. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, urged \u201cnew and more biting\u201d international economic sanctions on North Korea, with China exercising its political influence over Pyongyang. Representative Mac Thornberry, the Texas Republican who chairs the armed services committee, proposed deploying theater missile defense systems with South Korea, bolstering national missile defense and expanding the US nuclear arsenal. \u201cUnfortunately, the view around the world is that US leadership is in decline, while the administration\u2019s inaction only fuels those concerns,\u201d Thornberry said. Yet as with previous tests, there was little appetite in either the administration or Congress for a militarized or unilateral response. Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said the North Korean problem continued to defy either solution, and urged China to more stridently enforce existing United Nations sanctions. \u201cWith every test, the political reality is they\u2019re advancing their knowledge and getting close to a warhead that can be miniaturized and used on a ballistic missile,\u201d Kimball said. North Korea is believed to possess between 10 and 16 nuclear weapons, using both plutonium and highly enriched uranium, according to a 2015 study from the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University. The study predicted \u201csignificant expansion\u201d in both Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs by 2020. A more difficult political step for Obama would be to revisit dormant multilateral disarmament talks with Pyongyang without preconditions, Kimball noted \u2013 a step the administration has resisted, despite pursuing it aggressively with the recent Iran nuclear deal. \u201cIran took up a great deal of bandwidth from the Obama administration, Congress and the international community in terms of time, attention and energy, and the North Korea problem festered by degree,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cThe Bush and Obama administrations have both missed opportunities to rein in the North Korean nuclear and missile programs. Realism demands a shift in US strategy at this point.\u201d Earnest, however, signalled more continuity than departure, saying that once the North Korea ends its \u201cprovocative acts\u201d, the US \u201ccould start to see North Korea emerge as a responsible participant in the international community\u201d. A State Department official also urged caution, characterising Kim Jong-un as a youthful outlier immune to the normal rules of diplomacy. \u201cEverybody understands that this is a tough nut to crack. This is a guy that\u2019s not necessarily all that driven by the concerns of the international community. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you get a hair-trigger and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to overreact. Part of this is about eliciting reaction and how the world reacts to him. There\u2019s an awful lot of people at risk here through this guy\u2019s unpredictability and rashness, and I think woe betide the international community that overplays a hand and reacts too harshly too quickly.\u201d Some commentators called for a tougher US stand. Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow for north-east Asia at the Heritage Foundation thinktank, wrote: \u201cIn addition to UN actions, Washington should augment US sanctions. President Barack Obama\u2019s assertion that North Korea is the most heavily sanctioned country in the world is simply not true. \u201cThe Obama administration has not fully implemented US laws and has targeted fewer North Korean entities than those of the Balkans, Burma, Cuba, Iran, and Zimbabwe. The US should target financial and regulatory measures against any government, financial, or business entity assisting North Korean nuclear, missile, and conventional arms; criminal activities; money laundering; or import of luxury goods.\u201d",
