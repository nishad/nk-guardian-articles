    "content": "Donald Trump has declared his 12-day Asia tour a \u201ctremendous success\u201d, claiming that \u201cAmerica is back\u201d as a global leader. The US president did not take questions from reporters, instead delivering an extended account of his five-nation trip, in which he claimed to have unified the world against the North Korean nuclear weapons programme, paved the way for a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific\u201d, and insisted on \u201cfree and reciprocal\u201d trade relations with the Pacific Rim. \u201cThe days of the United States being taken advantage of are over,\u201d Trump declared in the Diplomatic Room at the White House. On North Korea, Trump claimed to have had a productive meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, but restated the US rejection of the diplomatic option that Beijing has been promoting \u2013 a \u201cfreeze-for-freeze\u201d deal under which Pyongyang would pause its nuclear and missile development and the US would rein in military exercises with its regional allies. Trump did not repeat his prior threats of military action against Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime, simply noting the oft-repeated formula that \u201call options remain on the table\u201d. The president also claimed to have won agreement from China and other countries in the region to exert \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on North Korea, but Chinese officials have stressed that Beijing will do nothing to trigger a collapse of the Pyongyang regime. Perhaps as notable as what Trump said in the 24 minutes he spent behind the podium was what he did not say. He made no mention of the fate of the embattled Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, and ignored reporters\u2019 shouted queries of whether Moore should quit the race. Trump left the room without taking any questions. Republican leaders, who have called on Moore to step aside, have been eager for Trump to weigh in on allegations Moore sexually assaulted and preyed upon teenage girls. The controversy represents a crisis for the Republican party, and jeopardizes its precarious 52-48 majority in the Senate. Trump declined to weigh in on the allegations against Moore during his trip to Asia, telling reporters he was focused on his visit. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said last week that Trump believes Moore will \u201cdo the right thing and step aside\u201d if the claims are true, but cautioned against a rush to judgment. Since those comments, more women have come forward to accuse Moore of sexual misconduct, while reports have also surfaced that the former judge was banned from a shopping mall because of predatory behavior toward teenage girls. Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, became the first White House official to condemn Moore on Wednesday, telling the Associated Press: \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for people who prey on children.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a valid explanation [from Moore] and I have no reason to doubt the victims\u2019 accounts,\u201d Ivanka, a senior adviser, said. She did not, however, call on Moore to exit the race. The bulk of the president\u2019s statement on foreign policy was clearly aimed at his supporters, assuring them he was keeping his election promises on fighting for American jobs. He portrayed the Asia tour as being devoted to renegotiating trade deals in the US favor, getting regional allies like Japan and South Korea to pay more for the US military presence and the protection it provides. Trump claimed he had persuaded Japanese and Korean companies to make investments in the US that would create thousands of jobs. It was not immediately clear how many of those investments were a consequence of Trump\u2019s policies and how many had already been planned. He noted that the US and South Korea would soon start talks on a bilateral trade agreement, and said South Korea and Japan were willing to buy billions of dollars in US military hardware. Trump did not mention that during his tour, 11 US allies had decided to move ahead with the creation the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade zone without US involvement, following the president\u2019s withdrawal in March. Richard Haass, the president of Council on Foreign Relations, said in a tweet that Trump \u201cclaims to have established a new framework for trade in Asia when the reality is that the US has placed itself outside the best available framework for trade in the region.\u201d \u201cThe country will pay an enormous economic, strategic price as a result,\u201d Haass said. Lacking any real news, Trump\u2019s speech prompted more headlines for an awkward pause in which the president reached for a sip of water. He twice stopped mid-speech to quench his thirst, drawing instant comparisons to the viral moment in 2013 when Florida senator Marco Rubio made headlines with a desperate lunge for an out-of-shot water bottle while delivering the formal Republican response to Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union address. Trump chided Rubio at the time, tweeting: \u201cNext time Marco Rubio should drink his water from a glass as opposed to a bottle \u2013 would have much less negative impact.\u201d The incident even made its way to the 2016 Republican primary, when Trump mocked Rubio, then his opponent, over the infamous moment. At a rally in Texas, Trump splashed a water bottle on stage while exclaiming: \u201cIt\u2019s Rubio!\u201d The former rivals have shared a cordial rapport since Trump took office. Rubio swiftly responded to Trump\u2019s own water moment by tweeting in jest: \u201cSimilar, but needs work on his form. Has to be done in one single motion &amp; eyes should never leave the camera. But not bad for his 1st time.\u201d",
