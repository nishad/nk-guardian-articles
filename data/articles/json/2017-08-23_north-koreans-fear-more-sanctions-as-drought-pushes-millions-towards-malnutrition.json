    "content": "Sanctions and the worst drought for almost two decades threaten to cause severe hardship for millions of people in North Korea, while the country\u2019s leadership continues to plough scarce resources into its missile and nuclear programmes, according to UN agencies and those with contacts in the impoverished nation. A drought that ravaged crops earlier this summer will leave the North unable to properly feed many of its people, including soldiers in the country\u2019s million-strong army, the groups have warned. While living standards have improved for some North Koreans under Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership, many of the country\u2019s 25 million people face a struggle to secure enough food while others risk losing their jobs due to sanctions, according to Jiro Ishimaru, a Japanese documentary maker who runs a network of citizen journalists inside North Korea. \u201cFor one thing, there are too many soldiers to feed,\u201d Ishimaru, whose contacts are equipped with contraband mobile phones, told the Guardian at his Asia Press office in the western Japanese city of Osaka. \u201cAnd corruption is rife, so that by the time senior military officers have taken their share of food provisions to sell for profit on the private market, there is next to nothing left for ordinary soldiers.\u201d Ishimaru, who spoke to several contacts about living conditions in North Korea from the Chinese border earlier this month, added: \u201cOne of them told me that there was talk of war with the US, but that many North Korean soldiers are in poor physical condition and in no fit state to fight.\u201d Ishimaru fears the focus on missile launches and rising tensions between Pyongyang and Washington means the plight of ordinary North Koreans is being overlooked. \u201cThis is exactly what Kim Jong-un wants \u2013 to project an image of strength, that he and the people are one and the same. In an ordinary country there would be riots over the food shortages, but not in North Korea.\u201d The state\u2019s inability to provide has spawned a private market in food and Chinese-made clothes that is tolerated, if not encouraged, by officials. \u201cThe authorities allow it to continue because they know the state would collapse otherwise,\u201d he added. The UN, concerned about the prospect of widespread malnutrition and other illnesses after the country suffered its worst drought since 2001, has approved $6.3m in aid to help it cope with shortages of corn, rice, maize, potatoes and other essential crops. The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the ruling Workers\u2019 party of Korea, reported that \u201cprevention battles\u201d had been launched to counter an \u201cabysmal drought\u201d that began in May according to the NK News website. In a special alert last month, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimated North Korea\u2019s early-season crop production was down almost a third from the same period last year. \u201cMore rains are urgently needed to avoid significant decreases in the main 2017 cereal production season,\u201d the report said. \u201cShould drought conditions persist, the food security situation is likely to further deteriorate.\u201d It added: \u201cMost of the country\u2019s population is critically dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. At this point, it is vital that farmers receive appropriate and timely agricultural input assistance.\u201d UN officials are determined to prevent a repeat of a famine in the mid-1990s that, according to some estimates, killed as many as one million North Koreans. Ishimaru, who last week witnessed \u201cclearly undernourished\u201d soldiers washing their uniforms in the Yalu river near the Chinese border, said: \u201cThe drought, combined with sanctions, will take the North Korean economy in a dangerous direction by next spring. This is a time of real hardship for ordinary people.\u201d As Kim and Donald Trump traded verbal blows over Pyongyang\u2019s missile tests, reports emerged of public discontent towards the regime\u2019s focus on weapons development. Soon after North Korea successfully launched a Hwasong-14 ICBM late last month, some residents in the country\u2019s North Pyongan province questioned the wisdom of inviting more international reprisals by testing ballistic missiles. The Daily NK website quoted a source in North Korea as saying that some residents felt \u201cdisillusioned by the Kim Jong-un regime, which spends more money on developing missiles than improving their livelihoods\u201d. The anonymous source added: \u201cEveryone is aware that whenever the regime launches a missile, economic sanctions will follow. There\u2019s nothing to celebrate for ordinary citizens. In the beginning, the residents were proud of the regime openly opposing the US with nuclear development and missiles, but these days, anti-US sentiment has weakened, while respect for the regime has plummeted.\u201d New UN sanctions that aim to slash by a third North Korea\u2019s $3bn annual export revenue risk creating an extra layer of misery for ordinary North Koreans. The measures are expected to threaten export-dependent jobs, including those at Musan mine, the country\u2019s biggest producer of iron ore. The ban on seafood exports will hit fishermen whose livelihoods depend on selling part of their catch to China.",
