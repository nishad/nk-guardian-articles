    "content": "Donald Trump has suggested he is open to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff with North Korea, urging Pyongyang to come to the table and make a deal in a marked shift from his previous rhetoric. The US is making progress in resolving the nuclear issue, the US president said at a joint press conference with South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in. \u201cI think we\u2019re making progress \u2026 I do see certain movement, yes, but let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d Trump said in Seoul, where he is spending two days of his 12-day tour of Asia. \u201cIt makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and to make a deal that\u2019s good for the people of North Korea,\u201d he said. Rather than give a specific update on recent developments over the North\u2019s nuclear programme he said he preferred to \u201cplay our cards close to the vest\u201d. Trump lowered the temperature on his previously incendiary language about North Korea. There were no threats of unleashing \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the North, as Trump has previously warned, nor did the president revive his derisive nickname for North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, \u201cLittle Rocket Man.\u201d However, North Korea showed little sign of retreating from efforts to develop nuclear armed missiles. \u201cAs long as the US and its followers continue their hostile acts against us, we will further bolster our nuclear, treasured sword of justice,\u201d the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers party, said in a commentary. In response to the North Korean threat, Trump said South Korea would be purchasing \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d worth of military equipment from the US. \u201cThat, frankly for them, makes a lot of sense and for us it means jobs, it means reducing our trade deficit,\u201d he said. In brief remarks welcoming him to the presidential residence, Moon lavished the US leader with praise, congratulating Trump on \u201cmaking great progress on making America great again\u201d. Later on Tuesday the two leaders will sit down for a state dinner that features an \u201cexquisite, 360-year-old soy sauce\u201d, meaning it predates the US itself. Trump\u2019s focus on renegotiating a trade deal with South Korea \u2013 his opening remarks repeatedly referred to economic issues before North Korea \u2013 drew criticism from some quarters. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to discuss trade and economic deals,\u201d said Park Ju-min, a South Korean politician. \u201cReassuring the US commitment to its alliance with South Korea is what Trump needs to focus on, and dealing with North Korea in a peaceful way.\u201d \u201cThis can\u2019t just be seen as Trump using the visit to sell weapons to South Korea,\u201d said Min Pyung-do, a lawmaker from the ruling Democratic party. \u201cWeapons are a part of it, but it\u2019s more important to build a cooperative relationship, not one where the US acts unilaterally.\u201d Many in central Seoul were unhappy at Trump\u2019s arrival. Throngs of protesters lined the streets outside the meeting, some holding signs that said: \u201cNo war, yes peace\u201d. \u201cWe should never trust someone who said a war will be not on US soil,\u201d said Kim Jun-sung, a protester, making a reference to Trump\u2019s earlier comments. Seung Hee-han, a member of the People\u2019s Democratic party, had been on a hunger strike for two days, holding a placard that likened Trump to Adolf Hitler. \u201cSouth Koreans are accustomed to living with the threat of war, the main difference now is Trump and his tendency to increase tensions with Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Won-thaek Kang, a politics professor at Seoul National University. \u201cI hope he can see what Seoul is like, a vibrant and thriving city, and that he will realise how damaging a war would be for us.\u201d But not everyone was opposed to Trump\u2019s visit. In the days before Trump arrived, nationalist protesters erected a sign on the pavement outside the US embassy in Seoul that read: \u201cMr Trump, we are not afraid to die. We want you to strike North Korea now!\u201d \u201cTrump needs to do something about North Korea right now,\u201d said Kim Min-su, a preacher at the All World Church who was waving a US flag in one hand and a South Korean flag in the other. \u201cPeople in North Korea are praising Jesus in underground churches, and South Korea is doing nothing about it, so it is up to Trump to free them.\u201d",
