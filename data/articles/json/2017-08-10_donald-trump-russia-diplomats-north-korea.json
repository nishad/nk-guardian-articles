    "content": "Donald Trump has thanked Vladimir Putin for expelling 755 American diplomatic staff from Russia, claiming that it will save the US \u201ca lot of money\u201d. The US president on Thursday held a characteristically freewheeling, subject-hopping, occasionally stunning question-and-answer session over 20 minutes with reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. When Putin announced last month that the American diplomatic mission in Russia must cut its staff by 755 employees, an ill-tempered response to new US sanctions, the gesture was seen as putting relations at their lowest ebb since the cold war. But Trump, widely criticised for his warm relationship with Putin, said on Thursday: \u201cI want to thank him, because we\u2019re trying to cut down our payroll and as far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll. \u201cThere\u2019s no real reason for them to go back. I greatly appreciate the fact that we\u2019ve been able to cut our payroll of the United States. We\u2019re going to save a lot of money.\u201d The claim was just one of many surprise insights into the thinking of Trump, who was flanked by Mike Pence, the vice-president, and the national security adviser, HR McMaster. Here are subject-by-subject highlights of the session, which the New York Times columnist Frank Bruni described as a \u201cmelodious aria\u201d of self-praise: North Korea \u201cHe does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody\u2019s seen before, what will happen in North Korea.\u201d Asked if that was a dare, Trump bristled: \u201cIt\u2019s not a dare. It\u2019s a statement. It has nothing to do with dare. That\u2019s a statement. He\u2019s not going to go around threatening Guam and he\u2019s not going to threaten the United States and he\u2019s not going to threaten Japan and he\u2019s not going to threaten South Korea. No, that\u2019s not a dare, as you say. That is a statement of fact.\u201d How the threat of nuclear weapons compares with climate change \u201cNuclear to me, No 1, I would like to \u2018de-nuke\u2019 the world. I know that President Obama said global warming is the biggest threat. I totally disagree. I\u2019d like to de-nuke the world. I would like Russia, the United States and China and Pakistan and many other countries that have nuclear weapons get rid of them. But until such time that they do, we will be the most powerful nuclear nation on earth, by far.\u201d Why he announced a ban on transgender personnel in the military \u201cI have great respect for the community. I think I\u2019ve had great support, or I\u2019ve had great support from that community. I got a lot of votes. But the transgender, the military\u2019s working on it now \u2026 It\u2019s been a very difficult situation and I think I\u2019m doing a lot of people a favour by coming out and just saying it. As you know, it\u2019s been a very complicated issue for the military, it\u2019s been a very confusing issue for the military, and I think I\u2019m doing the military a great favour.\u201d Investigations into leaks from the White House \u201cWe\u2019re looking. We\u2019re always looking. We have two leaks. You have the leaks coming out of intelligence and various departments having to do with Syria, having to do with all sorts of different places, having to do, frankly, with North Korea. And those are very serious. And then you have the leaks where people want to love me and they\u2019re all fighting for love. Those are not very important but certainly we don\u2019t like them. Those are little inner-White House leaks. They\u2019re not very important. But actually I\u2019m somewhat honored by them. But the important leaks and the leaks that the attorney general is looking at very strongly are the leaks coming out of intelligence and we have to stop them for the security and the national security of our country.\u201d Whether he will dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller \u201cI haven\u2019t given it any thought. Well, I\u2019ve been reading about it from you people. You say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to dismiss him.\u2019 No, I\u2019m not dismissing anybody. I mean, I want them to get on with the task. But I also want the Senate and the House to come out with their findings. Now, judging from the people leaving the meetings, they leave the meetings all the time and they say we haven\u2019t found anything \u2026 \u201d Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election \u201cWe\u2019re working with him. We have a situation that\u2019s very unusual. There was no collusion between us and Russia. In fact, the opposite. Russia spent a lot of money on fighting me ... Additionally, it seems that Russia spent a lot of money on that false report, and that was Russian money, and I think it was Democrat money too. You could say that was collusion. Plus the Democrats colluded on the Ukraine, so they colluded. \u201c... So, we have an investigation of something that never took place. And all I say is work with them, because this is an event that never took place. Now, as far as somebody else, where did they file the right papers, or did they forget to file a paper. You know, like I guarantee that if we went around and looked at everybody who made a speech or whatever these people did, that\u2019s up to them. \u201cDid they do something wrong because they didn\u2019t file the right document or whatever? Perhaps, you\u2019d have to look at them, but I guarantee you this, there are probably a lot of people in Washington who did the same thing.\u201d FBI raid of former campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s home \u201cI thought it was a very, very strong signal, or whatever. I know Mr Manafort. Haven\u2019t spoken to him in a long time, but I know him. He was with the campaign for a relatively short period of time. I thought it was a very \u2013 you know, they do that very seldom, so I was surprised to see it. I was very, very surprised to see it.\u201d Asked if he had talked to the attorney general or FBI about the raid, Trump replied: \u201cNo, I have not, but to do that early in the morning, whether or not it was appropriate, you\u2019d have to ask them. I\u2019ve always found Paul Manafort to be a very decent man. He\u2019s like a lot of other people, probably makes consultant fees from all over the place, who knows, I don\u2019t know, but I thought it was pretty tough stuff to wake him up, perhaps his family was there. I think that\u2019s pretty tough stuff.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, transportation secretary Elaine Chao \u201cElaine is doing a very good job. We\u2019re very proud of Elaine as secretary of transportation, as you know. She\u2019s doing a very good job. I\u2019m very disappointed in Mitch. If he gets these bills passed, I\u2019ll be very happy with him and I\u2019ll be the first to admit it.\u201d Measuring his own success \u201cI actually said to Tim Cook of Apple, I said, \u2018You know Tim, I won\u2019t consider myself successful as president unless I see you start building those big, beautiful plants that you have all over China, you start building them in the United States.\u2019 And he\u2019s gonna do that.\u201d",
