    "content": "It is fair to say that the reporter tasked with working Kim Jong-un\u2019s comments into North Korea\u2019s latest statement on Tuesday\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile test did their job with even more relish than usual. As taunts go, Kim\u2019s comments, carried by the state KCNA news agency, raised the insult index several notches from Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion a day earlier that his North Korean counterpart find a more productive use of his time than developing a nuclear deterrent. The international response to the launch will only have inspired Kim to wring every last drop of propaganda value from the wave of opprobrium emanating from the White House and the Pentagon. His response was straight from the North Korean propaganda playbook \u2013 designed to both grab the world\u2019s attention and remind his domestic audience that, five-and-a-half years after his coronation following the sudden death of his father, Kim Jong-il, he has dramatically strengthened his country\u2019s hand. While Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, attempted to galvanise world opinion, the KCNA\u2019s description of Kim \u201cfeasting his eyes\u201d on the ICBM and breaking into a \u201cbroad smile\u201d \u2013 complete with photos of him punching the air in the company of delirious generals \u2013 would not have been out of place had he been attending an inter-Korean football match, with the North 3-0 up with only minutes on the clock. Just as significant anniversaries in the North Korean calendar provide opportunities for the Kim dynasty to burnish its reputation at home, Kim was canny enough to spy the opportunity for maximum mischief offered by the most auspicious date in US history. According to KCNA, he described the ICBM as a gift for the \u201cAmerican bastards\u201d as they celebrated the anniversary of their country\u2019s independence. Kim did not stop there, blithely urging his nuclear scientists to \u201cfrequently send big and small \u2018gift packages\u2019 to the Yankees\u201d in the form of yet more missile and nuclear tests. After inspecting the Hwasong-14 missile, he \u201cexpressed satisfaction, saying it looked as handsome as a good-looking boy and was well made\u201d. This, of course, was the potentially game-changing development in North Korea\u2019s brinkmanship with the US that Trump vowed would never happen. But with a succession of high-level \u2013 and occasionally brutal \u2013 purges of would-be challengers at home, experts say Kim is now more closely associated with North Korean military might than his father or grandfather, the country\u2019s founder Kim Il-sung. \u201cKim Jong-il\u2019s legacy was mixed \u2013 he let the army run the country for 10 years because he was afraid of a coup,\u201d said Robert Kelly, a North Korea expert at Pusan National University. \u201cKim Jong-un has tied himself to the success of the nuclear programme, which is why denuclearisation is not going to happen. Trump\u2019s public comments on North Korea had played into the stereotype of Americans propagated by the state\u2019s media. \u201cThe US is central to North Korean propaganda, so when Trump talks about sending an armada to the Korean peninsula, or bombing North Korea, that plays into their hands.\u201d Nicholas Smith, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, believes that Kim\u2019s rhetoric and actions are \u201ca carefully crafted strategy of brinkmanship, designed mostly for maintaining his domestic grip on power\u201d. \u201cThe biggest challenge in his position as supreme leader \u2013 one all autocrats face \u2013 is how to maintain his authoritarian rule,\u201d Smith wrote in an opinion piece for the Conversation. \u201cKim Jong-un, like his father Kim Jong-il, has been able to pursue this strategy of brinkmanship with great success, at least for domestic purposes. This is mainly because despite all the international repercussions to date \u2013 ostracism, sanctions, and threats of intervention \u2013 China has been willing to prop up North Korea.\u201d The retaliatory launch of ballistic missiles by US and South Korean forces on Wednesday morning will not only have reminded remind Kim of the military might of his enemies, but reinforced a tenet of Kim dynasty propaganda: that North Korea is surrounded by hostile forces intent on its eradication. \u201cKim Jong-un loves this, because it reinforces the image of North Korea standing up to a big, bullying imperialist,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt fits exactly with the way North Korea wants to be portrayed, rather than the rogue, gangster state that it really is.\u201d \u201cIt would help if Trump backed away a little. His childish, personalised tweets bring the US down to the level of the North Koreans, and we know from the racist and sexist things it said about Barack Obama and Park Geun-hye that you are never going to win a mud-slinging contest with the KCNA.\u201d No one knows if Kim ever received the copy of Trump\u2019s Art of the Deal that Dennis Rodman presented to the North Korean sports minister during his recent visit to Pyongyang. If the deal in question is how to wrong-foot a far more powerful nemesis, then he can probably live without the advice. Having thrust his country to the top of the US\u2019s foreign policy \u201cto do\u201d list and cemented his domestic image as all that stands between North Korea and US aggression, round one of the post-ICBM era must surely go to Kim. In Trump\u2019s words: a pretty smart cookie indeed.",
