    "content": "The Australian federal police have arrested a man in Sydney over allegedly acting as an economic agent for North Korea, attempting to sell missile components and coal on the international black market. Choi Han Chan, a 59-year-old man from Sydney\u2019s Eastwood, allegedly breached United Nations sanctions and Australian federal law, and has been charged with brokering sales and discussing the supply of weapons of mass destruction. The alleged deals involved entities in Indonesia, Vietnam and other undisclosed countries. Choi is a naturalised Australian citizen of South Korean descent who had lived in Australia for about 30 years, Australian federal police (AFP) assistant commissioner Neil Gaughan told the media in Sydney on Sunday. Gaughan stressed there was no threat to Australians and that the man was not considered a \u201cspy\u201d. \u201cThis man was acting as a loyal agent for North Korea who believed he was acting to serve some higher patriotic purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day he would sell whatever he could to make money for the North Korean government.\u201d He said evidence suggested there had been contact \u201cwith high ranking North Korean officials\u201d but he wouldn\u2019t provide further details. The AFP alleges Choi acted as a broker for the North Korean regime, unsuccessfully attempting to sell missile components \u2013 namely software for a guidance system \u2013 and technical expertise to unnamed international entities. \u201cWe believe this man participated in discussions about the sale of missile componentry from North Korea to other entities abroad, as another attempt to try and raise revenue for the government of North Korea, in breach of sanctions.\u201d Gaughan would not identify the international entities or their location, but said there were no governments or government officials involved. \u201cThis is black market 101,\u201d he said. At least two charges relate to an alleged attempt to transfer North Korean coal, misrepresented as Russian anthracite, to entities in Indonesia and Vietnam in breach of UN sanctions. The man is also believed to have attempted to sell gemstones and other product. Financial records indicated transfers of more than A$500,000 but if the alleged trades had been successful it would have raised \u201ctens of millions\u201d of dollars, Gaughan said. The investigation began this year, triggered by information provided by a foreign law enforcement agency about a different matter. Choi was arrested on Saturday morning at his home in the northern Sydney suburb of Eastwood, and later charged with six offences stretching from 2008 up to this year. Further charges have not been ruled out. The case went before the Parramatta local court on Sunday morning. He was reportedly refused bail. It\u2019s the first time anyone in Australia has been charged with offences under the country\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, and the first time anyone has been charged specifically over alleged breaches of UN sanctions against North Korea. The charges attract penalties of up to 10 years in prison. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, congratulated the efforts of the AFP. He said he\u2019d been briefed on the arrest on Saturday morning, and the charges were \u201cof the greatest nature\u201d. \u201cThese are very serious matters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is vitally important that all nations enforce these sanctions.\u201d Efforts by North Korea to build its intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities have accelerated in recent months. This year alone has seen three long-range test launches. The Australian government has repeatedly expressed its support for the US in opposition to the actions of the North Korean regime. Citing the ANZUS treaty between Australia, New Zealand, and the US, Turnbull said in August that Australia would join the US in war. \u201cIf there is an attack on the United States by North Korea, then the ANZUS Treaty will be invoked and Australia will come to the aid of the United States just as if there was an attack on Australia, the United States would come to our aid,\u201d he said. In October North Korean state media said Australia was \u201cshowing dangerous moves of zealously joining the frenzied political and military provocations of the US against DPRK\u201d. In response the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, who had recently visited the demilitarised zone, dismissed the threat. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s threats only strengthen our resolve to find a peaceful solution to the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula caused entirely by North Korea\u2019s illegal, threatening and provocative behaviour,\u201d she said. The growing concerns about North Korea have been met with inconsistent messages from the US, particularly with mixed responses from the state department and the White House. On Saturday the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, appeared to stand by an offer of dialogue with North Korea, saying the US would \u201ckeep our channels of communication open\u201d. \u201cAs I said earlier this week, a sustained cessation of North Korea\u2019s threatening behavior must occur before talks can begin. North Korea must earn its way back to the table,\u201d he said at a ministerial meeting of the UN security council.",
