    "content": "Chinese officials have been quick to take credit for some of the outcomes of a historic summit between the US and North Korea on Tuesday. Following the meeting between US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, China\u2019s foreign minister Wang Yi hailed China\u2019s \u201cindisputable\u201d role in the process. \u201cIt is fair to say that the relevant approach and initiative proposed by China and its endeavours \u2026 have played a positive and constructive role in getting the situation on the peninsula to where it is now.\u201d China\u2019s state-run media called the summit a \u201csuccess\u201d and something China had long been \u201cworking toward.\u201d China, North Korea\u2019s largest trading partner and most powerful ally, was not present at the summit in Singapore but Beijing has emerged as a clear winner. Trump surprised allies by announcing the US would stop holding military exercises with South Korea, a measure China first proposed to Washington last year, known as the \u201cfreeze for freeze\u201d initiative. Trump initially rejected the proposal, in which North Korea would stop conducting nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a halt in military exercise between the US and South Korea. \u201cThe China-proposed \u2018suspension for suspension\u2019 initiative has been materialised and now the situation is moving forward,\u201d Wang said, in comments to reporters in Beijing. Trump also called the war games \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cinappropriate,\u201d echoing language both Beijing and Pyongyang have used to characterise the annual war games that have been conducted for decades. \u201cTrump suspending joint drill between the US and South Korea shows sincerity,\u201d said Lu Chao, an expert in North and South Korea relations at the Liaoning Academy of Social Science. China may benefit in other ways. Soon after the summit\u2019s conclusion, Beijing called for lifting international sanctions on Pyongyang, a move that would give trade in China\u2019s northeastern regions across the border from North Korea a needed boost. \u201cAs a neighbour, China\u2019s role is to take more responsibility as a regional power. China is an important mediator between the US and North Korea, and China will maintain this role,\u201d Lu said.",
