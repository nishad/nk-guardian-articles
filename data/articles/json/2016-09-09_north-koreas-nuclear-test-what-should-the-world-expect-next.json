Coming only nine months after its last nuclear detonation and following ever-advancing ballistic missile tests, including a successful submarine launch just two weeks ago, Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest wake-up call to world leaders will be hard to ignore. But why now? And, for a leadership recently experiencing a flurry of high-profile defections, what does the latest test mean about stability in Pyongyang? 1. Why now? Duyeon Kim, visiting senior fellow, Korean Peninsula Future Forum This apparent nuclear test is not surprising, because we have been \u2013 and should continue to expect \u2013 North Korea to continue testing its nuclear devices and missiles. Pyongyang has every technological, political and strategic reason to continue testing, and continued launches will only help perfect its technology. Today\u2019s timing is also politically advantageous, because it coincides with the anniversary of the regime, Founding Day, and a series of international summits in the region. I\u2019d be curious to learn if this was one or two simultaneous tests. India tested two nuclear devices together before calling it quits, and I have wondered if or when North Korea would think about following suit. Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation Korea watchers endlessly debate the timing and motivation of North Korean actions, looking for a linkage to anniversaries, potential regime instability, or a supposed response to US or South Korean movements. Such debate is the lifeblood of analysts but is ultimately worthless. Instead, the focus should be on the North Korean actions \u2013 which are provocations, violations of UN resolutions or laws, or deadly attacks \u2013 rather than the array of possible regime motivations. Perhaps the latest nuclear test was indeed timed to celebrate North Korean Founding Day, a major national holiday, but more important than the timing is that the test is another blatant defiance of UN resolutions and the international community must respond. 2. What does this signify about the regime? Bruce Bennet, RAND During Kim\u2019s four-year reign, Pyongyang has conducted 37 missile tests, more than twice as many as his father Kim Jong-il did during 17 years in office. The nuclear test is not reflective of regime stability or instability, but is rather the manifestation of Pyongyang\u2019s decades long quest to develop, augment, and refine its nuclear arsenal and the means to deliver them via missiles against the US and its allies. This year North Korea has engaged in a rapid-fire series of tests. In addition to the two nuclear tests, Kim has successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile, a road-mobile intermediate-range missile, a submarine-launched ballistic missile, upgraded medium- and short-range missiles, re-entry vehicle technology, a new solid-fuel rocket engine, and an improved liquid-fuel ICBM engine. Cha Du-Hyeogn, Korean Institute of Reunification This North Korean test is a cynical message to the Seoul government, which has been claiming that the North is undergoing an internal breakdown. We do not have the confirmed data on its magnitude yet, but if the result is significantly better \u2013 for example, twice as stronger than before \u2013 then its message [of strength] will carry far more weight. Eom Sang-Yoon, The Sejong Institute The test can consolidate internal unity. However, the impact on regime stability would have been greatest after their first test. This is the fifth test (so it will have a smaller ripple effect), but Kim Jong-un doesn\u2019t have any other option available to him to consolidate his power. In reality, the best way to stabilise the regime is by developing economy and making people live well. However, Kim has limited options, and boasts his leadership through military armaments. 3. What does this mean for South Korea and the US? John Delury, associate professor of Chinese Studies, Yonsei University The North Korean regime is very aware of American politics. They are certainly aware that there is an election coming up. On the one hand, they are getting a fifth test over with before the new president takes office, while they are also putting a kind of exclamation point on the end of the eight years of the Obama policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d. This is the North Korean way of saying \u201cSee look, here\u2019s what you\u2019ve reaped.\u201d For South Korea, what we\u2019ve seen this year is South Korea reverting to a traditional, conservative approach and just really not talking to the North Koreans. So what does the fifth test do? I think it will just prompt Seoul to apply more pressure internationally, so I don\u2019t think this was any type of game changer. 4. Will this be enough to get China back on onboard with sanctions? Duyeon Kim, KPFF The latest apparent nuclear test places a burden on China, but Beijing is unlikely to crack down on Pyongyang the way the international community desires, because of its own strategic interests and because it believes in positive inducements like dialogue and a peace treaty to change North Korean behaviour. But Beijing might consider rethinking its current position if Washington\u2019s response creates a negative security environment for China. Bruce Bennet, RAND China has recently been placing major pressure on South Korea to prevent the US deployment of the THAAD missile defence system in Korea \u2013 a system designed for protection against the growing North Korean nuclear and missile threat. As part of that pressure, China has apparently been lax in imposing the sanctions from UN Security Council Resolution 2270 (reportedly, trade between China and North Korea actually grew 9% in 2016 versus 2015). It is hard to tell whether China will decide to assume the role of a regional Great Power and seek to curtail the North\u2019s provocative behaviour \u2013 thus far, China has not decided to do so. It is ironic that China opposes the THAAD missile defence system being deployed in South Korea when China deploys a similar missile system referred as the HQ-19, which it appears to deploy against the North Korean NoDong and Musudan missiles \u2013 the same threats that worry South Korea.
