    "content": "North Korea has raised the prospect of a pre-emptive strike with nuclear weapons in an official statement. However, there is no imminent danger from North Korea to the US mainland. Our military personnel and facilities in the Asia-Pacific and our allies such as South Korea, Japan, and Australia, are more vulnerable. But US military capabilities, both conventional and nuclear, are potent forms of deterrence against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK). If we worry, it should be about the DPRK\u2019s ceaseless efforts to develop more advanced nuclear technology and other weapons of mass destruction, including biological and chemical ones. So how many weapons do they have? The DPRK possesses about 1,000 missiles of various capabilities, but only their short-range (1,000km or less) and medium-range ballistic missiles (1,000-3,000km) are accurate enough to attack cities, ports and military bases. Estimates of the number of nuclear warheads range from 10 to 16. Are their missiles capable of reaching the US? Yes and No. North Korea may be able to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile (5,500km), but lacks key technical requirements for a successful missile attack \u2013 such as re-entry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and accuracy of targeting. Its missile technology has improved considerably since 2009, including progressive efforts to miniaturize warheads and increase payloads (explosive power). Its long-range missiles can hypothetically hit the west coast of the US, but successful flight-testing of such a weapon system has not occurred. The rocket launch in February 2016 used the Taepodong-2, but the rocket\u2019s later stages did not reach the altitude required for an ICBM, climbing to 466-500km above the Earth; a peak altitude of more than 1,000km is needed for a successful attack. Even if the range and altitude were sufficient, a re-entry vehicle would have to survive hitting the atmosphere at roughly 16,000 miles per hour in order to do damage. As of yet, there is no evidence that North Korea has such capabilities. Would they be able to get past missile defense systems? Even if they did launch a missile, it would probably be intercepted quite quickly. Four of the six US command centers (Stratcom, Norad, Northcom and Pacom) that oversee ballistic missile defense system are prepared to detect and intercept strikes from North Korea. There are 30 ground-based interceptor missiles stationed in Fort Greely, Alaska, and Vandenberg air force base, California. There is a push to increase this to 40, but questions over their reliability remain. In the Asia-Pacific, the US has four Aegis (ballistic missile defense) capable ships and the AN/TPY-2 radar in Japan. In addition, the recent decision to permanently station the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in Guam is a direct response to North Korea\u2019s provocations. Formal consultations with South Korea over THAAD deployment in that country are now under way, while Australia has also welcomed greater cooperation with the US on missile defense systems. Why is North Korean doing this? North Korea is doing this mainly as a response to sanctions. The rhetoric, \u201cnuclear weapons to be ready at any time\u201d, is North Korea\u2019s far-fetched attempt to persuade the world that they have successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead, which is highly doubtful. More so than the international audience, the statement is directed towards North Korean citizens, in an attempt to bolster support for the leadership. At the same time, North Korea is flexing its muscles in the face of joint US-South Korean military exercises, which are held annually around this time. It is a \u201ctradition\u201d for the DPRK to lash out in some form to protest against the military might of that bilateral alliance. Described as being record-breaking in terms of scale, this year\u2019s joint exercise includes more than 90,000 South Korean and 15,000 US troops (four times the number of US troops used last year). North Korea also regularly conducts tests in order develop their nuclear and missile technology. In 2014 alone, the UN counted at least 13 ballistic missile tests from various locations inside the DPRK.",
