    "content": "In the ongoing debacle about The Interview \u2013 a film in which Seth Rogen is sent to assassinate Kim Jong-un \u2013 North Korea has taken aim at the United States. Calling the country a \u201ccesspool of terrorism\u201d, officials accused Washington of being directly involved with the film plot and threatened retaliation. \u201cThe army and people of the DPRK are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the US in all war spaces, including cyber warfare to blow up those citadels,\u201d said a statement on the KCNA, the country\u2019s official news channel. The Interview was cancelled by Sony Pictures last week after hackers calling themselves Guardians of Peace made threats against potential cinema audiences. Last month the company suffered a serious cyberbreach, which the US has blamed on North Korea. Pyongyang has praised the cyber attack but denies it was responsible, calling the White House \u201creckless\u201d for saying it was. So, could a such juvenile film be the start of world war three? Unlikely, according to those familiar with North Korea who doubt Pyongyang\u2019s capacity to follow through on such threats. The country is well practiced in the art of brinkmanship, using threatening, often Shakespearean language, against its key antagonists, Tokyo, Seoul and Washington, and beyond. We take a look at who they lashed out at in 2014 and why. The neighbours The North\u2019s immediate neighbours are a popular target for attacks, with the South, who are within the boundary of short-and medium-range missiles, bearing the brunt. In November, upset about a UN decision to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court over its human rights record, KCNA put out a series of eight bellicose articles in which they threatened to nuke South Korea\u2019s Blue House. They also called Japan a \u201cpolitical pygmy\u201d and threatened to send the country to the bottom of the sea. Political leaders Sometimes the threats got personal. In May, after an official US visit to Seoul, North Korea called the South Korean president a \u201ccrafty prostitute\u201d in thrall to her \u201cpimp\u201d Barack Obama who, in a related editorial, was called a \u201cwicked black monkey\u201d. In August North Korea lashed out at John Kerry calling him \u201ca wolf with a hideous lantern jaw\u201d after the US and South Korea carried out joint military drills. They said they were also unhappy about Kerry\u2019s comments on North Korea\u2019s human rights record. The UN International organisations did not escape. The North threatened a nuclear attack ahead of a UN vote on whether to to refer the country to the ICC. After the vote was passed the North declared the motion \u201cgrave political provocation\u201d orchestrated by the US, although it was drafted by the UN and the European Union. Pyongyang then organised mass protests in Kim Il-sung square, accusing the UN of relying on trumped-up allegations by defectors backed by the US and other countries seeking to overthrow its ruling regime. Earlier in the year North Korea released its own rosy report on human rights claiming that they were enjoyed by the popular masses. In a sprawling document it again took aim at the US and its allies, accusing them in being \u201csteeped in repugnancy toward the DPRK\u201d. Defectors were called \u201chuman scum who betrayed their homeland and people\u201d. In an earlier editorial Michael Kirby, the chair of UN Commission Inquiry into human rights, was attacked over his sexuality. Plants A Christmas tree also became diplomatic sore spot, as plans by a South Korean Christian group to rebuild an illuminated installation, three miles from the atheist North\u2019s border, were shelved. North Korea had called it a \u201csymbol of frantic anti-North confrontation rackets\u201d aimed at aggravating \u201cextreme tension\u201d between the two Koreas. They warned of a \u201ccatastrophic impact\u201d if the reconstruction was to go ahead, leaving some living near the tower site in Gimpo to raise concerns about their safety Balloons Balloons containing anti-Pyongyang leaflets, which have been periodically floated across the border by South Korean activists, also came under fire. The North said it considered these leaflet drops \u201ca war-provoking act\u201d and that they would \u201cmercilessly crush the source of provocation and forces behind this operation.\u201d They also said that: \u201cspeaking ill of and criticising our highest leadership and system with evil bad mouthing through these consistent cross-border leaflets is the gravest act of hostility that obstructs inter-Korean relations and peace and unity in the nation.\u201d",
