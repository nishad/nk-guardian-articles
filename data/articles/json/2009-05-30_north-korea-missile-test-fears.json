    "content": "Spy satellites have spotted signs that North Korea may be preparing to transport another long-range missile to a test-launch site, South Korean officials said today, as the US defence secretary issued his harshest warning to the North since its recent nuclear test. \"We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in Asia \u2013 or on us,\" Robert Gates told a regional defence meeting in Singapore. He said the North's nuclear program was a \"harbinger of a dark future\", but wasn't yet a direct threat. Since the nuclear blast on Monday, North Korea has test-launched six short-range missiles and announced it was abandoning a 1953 truce ending fighting in the Korean War. The communist state appears to be preparing to move a long-range missile by train from a weapons factory near Pyongyang to its north-eastern Musudan-ni launch pad, a South Korean defence ministry official said. Images of the movements were captured by US satellites. North Korea will need about two weeks to complete the launch preparation, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. The missile might be tested around 16 June, when the US and South Korean presidents are to meet in Washington, Yonhap quoted an unidentified intelligence official as saying. The agency said the size of the missile was similar to that of a long-range rocket the North tested in April. Experts have said the three-stage rocket has a potential range of more than 4,100 miles (6,700km), putting Alaska within striking distance. Officials in Washington said yesterday they had noticed indications of increased activity at the test site, but did not provide many details. The UN has been negotiating a new resolution in response to the North's nuclear test, the second it has conducted. A partial draft resolution obtained by the Associated Press calls on all countries to immediately enforce sanctions imposed by an earlier resolution after the North's first test in 2006. The sanctions include a partial arms embargo, a ban on luxury goods and ship searches for illegal weapons or material. They have been sporadically implemented, with many of the 192 UN member states ignoring them. The draft would also have the security council condemn \"in the strongest terms\" the North's recent nuclear test \"in flagrant violation and disregard\" of the 2006 resolution. At the defence meeting in Singapore, Chinese Lt Gen Ma Xiaotian said Beijing was \"resolutely opposed to nuclear proliferation\", but called on nations to \"remain cool-headed\". The South Korean defence minister, Lee Sang-hee, said the test \"has made a solution of the North Korean nuclear problem more difficult\". North Korea has said it conducted the nuclear test in self-defence. It has accused the US of planning a pre-emptive strike to oust the regime of its leader, Kim Jong Il \u2013 an allegation Washington has repeatedly denied. North Korea has warned it will not accept sanctions or other punitive measures from the security council. Some analysts say one of the aims of the North's nuclear and missile tests is to strengthen Kim's regime and boost morale in the impoverished nation. Rallies were being held across the country for citizens and soldiers who were celebrating the nuclear test, the North's official Korean central news agency said today. It said speakers offered their \"ardent congratulations\" to nuclear scientists and engineers for bolstering the country's dignity.",
