    "content": "Donald Trump has vowed to take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to protect United States allies from North Korea\u2019s evolving military threat, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said following a phone conversation with the US president. The talks between Trump and Abe came after North Korea conducted its second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test on Friday \u2013 a move analysts said put most of the US within range of Pyongyang\u2019s missiles. The US mounted a show of force aimed at Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime on Sunday, flying two supersonic B-1B bombers over the Korean peninsula. The commander of the Pacific air forces, General Terrence J O\u2019Shaughnessy, warned his units were ready to hit North Korea with \u201crapid, lethal, and overwhelming force\u201d. Trump, who has been trying to convince Beijing to ramp up the pressure on Kim, condemned China for doing \u201cNOTHING\u201d to rein in the North Korean dictator. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said on Monday it was concerned about recent developments on the Korean peninsula and accused the US of trying \u201cto shift responsibility for the situation to Russia and China.\u201d China\u2019s state-run media hit back on Monday, with one newspaper branding Trump a \u201cgreenhorn\u201d who had lashed out at Beijing because he felt embarrassed by his failure to prevent North Korea\u2019s latest test-launch. \u201cIt is unreasonable for Trump to turn his temper into criticism against China,\u201d the English-language Global Times tabloid said in an editorial, claiming Beijing had \u201cexerted enormous pressure\u201d on Pyongyang. \u201cTrump claims that \u2018China could easily solve this problem,\u2019\u201d the Communist party controlled newspaper went on. \u201cBut such a statement could only be made by a greenhorn US president who knows little about the North Korean nuclear issue. Pyongyang is determined to develop its nuclear and missile program and does not care about military threats from the US and South Korea. How could Chinese sanctions change the situation?\u201d Another editorial in the same newspaper dismissed Trump\u2019s claims China was in a position to solve the North Korean crisis as an \u201cabsurdity\u201d. Speaking to reporters on Monday after his conversation with Trump, Abe said the pair had discussed \u201cfresh action\u201d against North Korea \u2013 and praised the US president\u2019\u2019s \u201ccommitment to taking all necessary measures to protect allies.\u201d \u201cI completely agreed with President Trump on the recognition that we must take further action,\u201d Abe told reporters, according to Japan\u2019s Kyodo news agency. \u201cWe have made repeated efforts to resolve the North Korean issue peacefully, coordinating between Japan and the United States and with the international community, but North Korea has trampled all over these efforts and unilaterally escalated [the situation],\u201d Abe said. \u201cChina, Russia and the rest of the international community must take seriously this undeniable fact and increase their pressure.\u201d Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, also sought to sustain the pressure on Beijing. \u201cChina must decide whether it is finally willing [to seriously challenge Kim Jong-un]. The time for talk is over,\u201d she said in a statement. On Saturday, US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, accused China and Russia of bearing a \u201cunique and special responsibility\u201d for the growing North Korean threat. Some experts believe Beijing is increasingly worried Trump might launch military action against North Korea. In April Trump unexpectedly ordered airstrikes against Syria while dining with Chinese president Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago club. Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea specialist from Beijing\u2019s Renmin University, said he believed the likelihood of US military action was growing but remained a high-risk move for Trump. \u201cIf Trump resorts to a military strike, and fails to get [congressional] approval, I think it would end his political career.\u201d Liu Ming, a North Korea expert from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told Bloomberg he believed Trump was bluffing: \u201cThe military option the Americans are threatening won\u2019t likely happen because the stakes will be too high ... It\u2019s a pretext and an excuse to pile up pressure on China. It\u2019s more like blackmail than a realistic option.\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea expert from the Middlebury institute of international studies, said that for all the tough talk military action was improbable given how advanced North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs now were. \u201cIf you attack a nuclear-armed country after it has nuclear weapons that is just a plain old nuclear war.\u201d Additional reporting by Wang Zhen",
