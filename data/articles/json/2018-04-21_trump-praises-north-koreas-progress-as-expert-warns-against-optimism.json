    "content": "Donald Trump has saluted Pyongyang\u2019s suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests ahead of planned talks with the US as \u201cvery good news for North Korea and the world\u201d. A leading Korean-American expert on the region, however, was among those to sound a note of caution. The suspensions went into immediate effect on Saturday, according to the state-run KCNA news agency. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is due to meet his South Korean counterpart next week, with a summit with Trump pencilled in to occur by June. Trump confirmed this week that CIA director and secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo recently met Kim in North Korea. On Friday night, Trump tweeted: \u201cNorth Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit. \u201cA message from Kim Jong Un: \u2018North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u2019 Also will \u2018Shut down a nuclear test site in the country\u2019s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.\u2019 Progress being made for all!\u201d However, Victor Cha, who has been seen as a contender to be US ambassador to South Korea, told Axios the North Korean statement was really a formalisation of discussions and a geopolitical ploy. \u201cThis is not a denuclearization statement,\u201d said Cha, now senior adviser and Korea chair for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt is a statement that DPRK [North Korea] can be a responsible nuclear weapons state.\u201d Kim Jong-un\u2019s government had \u201calready stated that they would halt all testing while in dialogue\u201d, Cha said. \u201cThis statement formalizes that promise. [T]he statement talks about a test ban, no first use, and no transfer \u2013 all the trappings of a \u2018responsible\u2019 nuclear weapons state \u2013 which is what they ultimately wanted to be accepted as. \u201cNo one believes this, but if they can get Trump to agree, that is all they need.\u201d Axios also quoted an unnamed national security council official from the administration of George W Bush as saying the North Korean statement was \u201ctotally reversible eye wash\u201d, as it was \u201cnot a big deal to pause testing nuclear or missiles when summit is coming\u201d. In Sweden, US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley hailed the North Korean move as evidence of the success of the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy pursued since Trump took office. Part of that approach has seen Trump exchanging insults with Kim, a leader with aspirations to be able to deliver a nuclear weapon to the US mainland. On Friday, Haley released a statement accompanying the release of the state department\u2019s Annual Human Rights Report in which she included North Korea among the \u201cworst human rights violators\u201d in the world. Speaking on Saturday at an informal working meeting of the UN security council ambassadors, Haley said UN pressure and sanctions had enabled the isolation of North Korea \u201cuntil they had a good behaviour, and now we are seeing they want to come to the table\u201d. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres told reporters \u201cthe path is open for the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\u201d.",
