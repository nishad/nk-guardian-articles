    "content": "Must the news forever be given a metropolitan slant? The caption on a photograph of the Burbo Bank windfarm in Liverpool Bay (Clean red skies, 25 May) states that the machines are taller than the Gherkin and their blades longer than nine London buses. As they are more likely to be seen by Liverpudlians than Londoners, would it not make more sense to make comparisons with, say, the Liver building and the width of the Anfield pitch? Martin Brayne Chinley, Derbyshire \u2022 Since Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Kim Jong-un of the North seem to have good personal chemistry and a clear vested interest in progress, why not cut out the foolish, overblown middleman \u2013 Donald Trump \u2013 and let them get on with it (Trump-Kim summit still on track says Moon after surprise meeting, 28 May)? Ian Bartlett East Molesey, Surrey \u2022 I can assure Myles Flynn (Letters, 26 May) that a thank-you from passengers to bus drivers is just as common in Oxford as it is in Edinburgh. I know because I live in one and frequently visit the other. Katherine El-Salahi Oxford \u2022 In 38 years\u2019 residence in Sheffield I have observed that thanking the bus driver is a near-universal practice. I couldn\u2019t have said the same of my native London when I moved north, but I find when visiting that the habit is spreading. Valerie Bayliss Sheffield \u2022 I have found a simple solution (How the humble stapler came to one reader\u2019s aid, 28 May): my butler staples the Guardian before ironing it.
