    "content": "The entire US Senate will go to the White House on Wednesday to be briefed by senior administration officials about the brewing confrontation with North Korea. The unusual briefing underlines the urgency with which the Trump administration is treating the threat posed by Pyongyang\u2019s continuing development of nuclear weapons and missile technology. It follows a lunch meeting Trump held with ambassadors from UN member states on the security council on Monday where he emphasised US resolve to stop North Korea\u2019s progress. \u201cThe status quo in North Korea is unacceptable and the council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs,\u201d Trump said at the meeting. \u201cNorth Korea is a big world problem, and it\u2019s a problem we have to finally solve.\u201d On Friday the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is due to chair a security council foreign ministers\u2019 meeting on the issue in New York, at which the state department said he would call once more for the full implementation of existing UN sanctions or new measures in the event of further nuclear or missile tests. \u201cThis meeting will give the security council the opportunity to discuss ways to maximise the impact of existing security council measures and to show their resolve to response further provocations with appropriate new measures,\u201d said Mark Toner, state department spokesman. Senators are to be briefed by the defence secretary, James Mattis, and Tillerson on Wednesday. Such briefings for the entire senate are not unprecedented but it is very rare for them to take place in the White House, which does not have large secure facilities for such classified sessions as Congress. Officials said the briefing would take place in the auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which can be adapted for such an event. Michael Anton, a spokesman for the national security council, said that although the Senate did have its own facilities, \u201cthe president offered this to [Senate majority leader Mitch] McConnell as a gesture and McConnell appreciated that so decided to do it here.\u201d \u201cKeep in mind this is still a Senate meeting, not a White House meeting,\u201d Anton added. Senate aides were unsure of the purpose of using the White House as a venue, speculating it could be symbolic and intended to show Trump\u2019s seriousness or to showcase an assertive president as he approaches 100 days in office. The state department appeared unaware on Monday that Tillerson would be delivering the briefing. A sixth North Korean nuclear test has been anticipated for some months now. Some observers speculated that it could be conducted on Tuesday, on the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean armed forces, but the morning came and went without one. Instead, Pyongyang held major live-fire drills in an area around its eastern coastal town of Wonsan, South Korea\u2019s military said. When the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, was asked what the US would do if Pyongyang carried out a nuclear test, she told NBC news: \u201cI think then the president steps in and decides what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Haley said on Monday the US was not \u201clooking for a fight\u201d with North Korea but warned Pyongyang should not \u201cgive us a reason\u201d for one. The US aircraft carrier Carl Vinson and its battlegroup are due to arrive off the Korean peninsula after exercises with the Japanese navy. An Ohio-class guided missile submarine, the USS Michigan, docked at the South Korean naval base of Busan on Tuesday, the US navy reported, in what was described as \u201ca routine visit\u201d. North Korea\u2019s state-run newspaper the Rodong Sinmun declared the country\u2019s armed forces were ready to show their strength by sinking the carrier \u201cwith a single strike\u201d. Meanwhile the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has called for calm in a phone call with Trump. China \u201chopes all parties involved will exercise restraint and avoid doing anything to exacerbate the tense situation on the peninsula\u201d, he said according to a summary of the call released by China\u2019s foreign ministry. In recent days Haley and other US officials have underlined China\u2019s helpfulness in seeking to increase pressure on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. \u201cWorking with China for the first time \u2014 they have really been our partner in trying to make sure that we hold him at bay, and I think it\u2019s a new day when you\u2019ve got China and the United States working together on a statement to condemn North Korea,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThey put pressure on him. He feels it. That\u2019s why he\u2019s responding this way. And I think it is a different day.\u201d",
