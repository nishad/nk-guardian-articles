    "content": "The US defense secretary, James Mattis, has warned the North Korean regime that it risked the \u201cend of its regime and the destruction of its people\u201d if it attacked Washington or its allies, as an eruption of brinksmanship from both sides rattled the region. Mattis\u2019s Wednesday reminder to Pyongyang that the allied militaries \u201cpossess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth\u201d, capped an unprecedented 24 hours of sabre-rattling sparked by Donald Trump\u2019s surprise threat to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d down on the Pyongyang regime. Despite the harsh rhetoric, there was no change in US military deployments or alert status. The defense secretary, however, couched his remarks in the language of traditional deterrence, making clear that such overwhelming force would be used in the event of a North Korean attack. Trump \u2013 without consulting his own security staff \u2013 had warned of a devastating onslaught \u201clike the world has never seen\u201d if Kim Jong-un\u2019s government simply persisted in threats against the US. But that line was crossed within hours when Pyongyang announced it was \u201ccarefully examining\u201d a plan for a missile strike an \u201cenveloping fire\u201d around the US Pacific territory of Guam. The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, also spent much of the day struggling to contain the fall-out from Trump\u2019s threats on Tuesday, assuring Americans they could \u201csleep well at night\u201d, and reassuring shocked allies that there was \u201cno imminent threat of war\u201d. Heather Nauert, the state department spokeswoman, said that Tillerson spoke with Trump for an hour on Wednesday, and insisted that there was unity of purpose in the administration. \u201cWhether its the White House state department, the Department of Defense, we are speaking with one voice,\u201d Nauert said. However, the intervention of senior administration figures to mitigate or reinterpret impromptu declarations from the Oval Office has become a recurring theme of the six chaotic months of the presidency. The dark threat to North Korea, issued from the clubhouse of the Trump golf resort in New Jersey, illustrated the unpredictability of the commander-in-chief, catching Trump\u2019s own advisors unaware with his fiery rhetoric. Tillerson\u2019s plane was due to make a stop at Guam, which is home to a US military base that includes a submarine squadron, an airbase and a coastguard group, and the secretary of state said he had no plans to change his route. \u201cNothing that I have seen, and nothing that I know of, would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours,\u201d Tillerson said. Tillerson defended Trump over his bellicose language, which shocked US allies and has been heavily criticised in the US and around the world as reckless. \u201cWhat the president is doing is sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong-un can understand, because he doesn\u2019t seem to understand diplomatic language,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cI think the president just wanted to be clear to the North Korean regime on the US unquestionable ability to defend itself, will defend itself and its allies.\u201d But while Tillerson was in the air, Trump posted on Twitter at 8am in Washington. His tone was not as heated as the threats of conflagration he issued on Tuesday from his New Jersey golf resort, but he did explicitly brandish his country\u2019s nuclear weapons in a way his predecessors had generally avoided. \u201cMy first order as president was to renovate and modernise our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!\u201d In fact, it was Barack Obama who approved the major overhaul and modernisation of the US nuclear stockpile, which the Trump administration is now reviewing. The arsenal is considerably smaller than it was at the height of the cold war, in the wake of a succession of arms controls treaties. The US and Russia are now at rough parity. The US has 6,800 warheads, while Russia has 7,000. Former US defense secretary, William Perry, warned in an email to the Guardian that \u201cempty threats\u201d would weaken nuclear deterrence and US credibility. \u201cOn August 8th, President Trump appeared to threaten first use of nuclear weapons against North Korea,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThis is a dangerous departure from historical precedent. The policy and practice of the United States on threats to use nuclear weapons has been consistent for many decades, and for presidents of both political parties.\u201d Tillerson sought to steer his own remarks away from nuclear weapons and toward Washington\u2019s diplomatic efforts to contain North Korea. He argued that the administration\u2019s policy of increasing economic pressure, culminating in new UN sanctions agreed at the security council on the weekend, was beginning to pay off. \u201cThe pressure is starting to show,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why the rhetoric coming out of Pyongyang is beginning to become louder and more threatening. Whether we\u2019ve got them backed into a corner or not is difficult to say, but, diplomatically, you never like to have someone in a corner without a way for them to get out.\u201d He said Pyongyang could ease the pressure by entering into negotiations with the US, which he has said could come only after Kim Jong-un\u2019s government suspended its missile tests and accepted that it would ultimately have to give up its nuclear weapons programme. Pyongyang, he said, would have to have \u201cthe right expectation of what those talks will be about\u201d. It became clear on Wednesday that Trump had issued his \u201cfire and fury\u201d threat without consulting his national security team on his use of language. He had piece of paper in front of him when he spoke at his golf resort in New Jersey, but the New York Times reported the paper was about the US crisis in opioid use. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the new chief of staff, John Kelly and other national security staff were aware beforehand what \u201ctone\u201d the president would adopt but added: \u201cThe words were his own.\u201d Trump had a telephone consultation with his advisers earlier on Tuesday in which the North Korea crisis was discussed but Trump is said to have given no warning of the language he would use, in which he resorted to one of his favourite turns of phrase, \u201clike the world has never seen\u201d, which he has used frequently to underline the significance of his actions. Guam\u2019s governor, Eddie Calvo, on Wednesday attempted to reassure residents that there was \u201cno threat\u201d of a North Korean strike, but added that the island was prepared for \u201cany eventuality\u201d. Calvo added: \u201cGuam is American soil \u2026 We are not just a military installation.\u201d In an online video message, he said he had been told by the US defense and homeland security departments that there was no change in the threat level for his territory. A Korean people\u2019s army (KPA) spokesman said in a statement Wednesday that a plan would be put into practice as soon as the order to attack Guam was issued by the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. \u201cThe KPA strategic force is now carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam with medium- to long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 in order to contain the US major military bases on Guam, including the Anderson air force base,\u201d the spokesman said. The state-run KCNA news agency quoted a second army spokesman accusing Washington of devising a \u201cpreventive war\u201d, adding that any attempt to attack the North would provoke \u201call-out war, wiping out all the strongholds of enemies, including the US mainland\u201d. The US should cease its \u201creckless military provocation\u201d against North Korea to avoid such a reaction, the spokesman added. In response, South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, called for an overhaul of the country\u2019s armed services, citing an \u201curgent\u201d need to improve its ability to defend against North Korean missile attacks. Beijing issued a brief foreign ministry statement on Wednesday calling on \u201call parties to avoid any words or actions that might escalate the situation\u201d. France and Germany also called on all sides to use restraint. \u201cWe are watching the increasing rhetorical escalation regarding the Korean Peninsula with the greatest concern,\u201d the German foreign ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer told reporters. Tensions in the region have risen since North Korea carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and test-launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month. The UN security council responded last weekend by unanimously agreeing sanctions designed to deprive the regime of about US$1bn in hard currency.",
