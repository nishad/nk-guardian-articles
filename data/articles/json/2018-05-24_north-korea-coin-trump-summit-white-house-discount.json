    "content": "The Donald Trump summit with Kim Jong-un may be over. But the opportunity to buy a coin commemorating the doomed meeting is not. In fact, it just got cheaper. The White House Gift Shop slashed the price of the \u201cPresident Trump United States and Korea Summit Coin\u201d on Thursday, after Trump cancelled the planned meeting with the North Korean leader. The online store selling the coin crashed, reporting an error message that the server was \u201ctoo busy\u201d. A note on the White House gift shop website described the coin, which comes in a black velvet case, as the \u201cdeal of the day\u201d. The deal of the day price is $19.95, down from the regular price of $24.95. The product description said the coin, designed to celebrate the summit, \u201cwill be made whether or not the summit occurs\u201d. According to the White House gift shop, this is because \u201cthe theme is coming close to peace and celebrates the act of communication among countries\u201d. The description adds that people buying the commemorative coin can request a refund if the summit does not occur. But according to the gift shop, \u201cmost supporters have said they want this heirloom of political history regardless of outcome\u201d. An associate at the White House visitor center told the Guardian \u201ca lot of people have called\u201d asking how they can get their money back on the coin. Staff at the gift shop did not answer the phone. The White House communications agency struck a commemorative coin to celebrate the summit earlier this week. It shows Trump and Kim in profile, with the American and North Korean flags in the background. The White House Gift Shop said the $19.95 coin is \u201cnot identical\u201d to that coin. The discounted coin also features the South Korean president Moon Jae-in. The shop offers free shipping on orders over $150; eager numismatists would have to purchase eight coins to take advantage of the offer. Trump suddenly called off the summit on Thursday. The president said he had been \u201cvery much looking forward\u201d to meeting Kim, but that \u201cbased on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting\u201d.",
