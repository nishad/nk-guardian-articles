    "content": "Kim Yo-jong\u2019s promotion to the politburo of North Korea\u2019s workers\u2019 party is a sign that Kim Jong-un has absolute trust in his younger sister \u2013 rumoured to be the brains behind his carefully constructed public image \u2013 as he seeks to tighten his grip on power. Yo-jong, who is four years younger than her brother, was rarely seen in public until 2010, when she was photographed attending a Korean Workers\u2019 party conference. By the following year, she was a regular presence in her father Kim Jong-il\u2019s entourage, and was seen mourning alongside her brother after their father\u2019s death in December 2011. She did not receive an official mention in North Korean state media until March 2014, when she accompanied Kim Jong-un during elections for the supreme people\u2019s assembly. There were even rumours that she was briefly responsible for state affairs during Kim\u2019s prolonged absence from public life \u2013 attributed to an undisclosed health problem \u2013 in the autumn of that year. Since Kim Jong-un\u2019s anointment as the third leader of the Kim dynasty, his sister has frequently been seen accompanying him during \u201cfield guidance trips\u201d and at other public events. Her promotion on Saturday means that she enjoys her brother\u2019s absolute trust, and cements her position as one of the two most visible women in North Korean public life, alongside the leader\u2019s wife, Ri Sol-ju. Kim Yo-jong was appointed vice-director of the party\u2019s propaganda and agitation department in late 2014, and used the role to create a cult of personality around her brother that included presenting him as a benevolent, accessible leader modelled on his grandfather, and North Korea\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung. She, not Kim, is said to be the inspiration behind his visits to theme parks, schools and the homes of ordinary people, and his unlikely friendship with the former NBA star Dennis Rodman. Family ties to Kim Jong-un are no guarantee of favourable treatment, or even of survival, as the young leader seeks to consolidate power through a series of purges estimated to have affected 140 senior military and government officials. He ordered the execution of his uncle and close adviser, Jang Song-thaek, in 2013, and is suspected of involvement in the assassination of his half brother, Kim Jong-nam, at Kuala Lumpur airport in February. Kim and Yo-jong, however, have the same mother: Ko Yong-hui, a Japanese-born former dancer who is thought to have been Kim Jong-il\u2019s third partner. Experts say Yo-jong\u2019s ascension to alternate member of the politburo \u2013 the country\u2019s top decision-making body \u2013 indicates she is Kim Jong-un\u2019s replacement for his aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, a member of his father\u2019s inner circle who does not have an active role in the new regime. Her promotion points towards a generational shift, as Kim seeks to make a clean break with the personnel who surrounded his father, according to some experts. \u201cThrough the personnel reshuffle, the Kim Jong-un regime has ended its co-existence with the remnants of the previous Kim Jong-il regime by carrying out a generational replacement in the party\u2019s key elite posts,\u201d Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, told Yonhap news agency. Like other members of the regime, verifiable information about Kim Yo-jong\u2019s life is hard to come by. She is believed to be in her late 20s, although some reports put her age at 30. Several accounts say she attended primary school in Berne, Switzerland, in the late 1990s \u2013 the same time as Kim Jong-un \u2013 before studying computer science at the prestigious Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang. An employee at the boarding school has said that the siblings lived in a private residence, surrounded by staff and bodyguards, according to the North Korea Leadership Watch website. Her father attempted to ease her isolation by sending North Korean musicians to Switzerland to keep her company, the site says. Nothing is known about Kim Yo-jong\u2019s life during the years following her university education and 2007, when she began to play a junior role in the ruling party. In the late 2000s she was involved in arranging her brother\u2019s succession to supreme leader \u2013 a more pressing issue after their father suffered two strokes in 2008. She reportedly married Choe Song, the son of the Workers\u2019 party vice chairman Choe Ryong-hae, in early 2015, and had a child in May that year. Significantly, the senior Choe was promoted to the party\u2019s powerful military commission last weekend, according to the official KCNA news agency. Yo-jong has not escaped the attention of US officials, who in January placed her and other North Korean officials on a blacklist for \u201csevere human rights abuses\u201d.",
