    "content": "The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has overseen the ousting of his previously powerful uncle Jang Song-thaek for crimes including faction-building and \u201cdissolute and depraved\u201d behaviour involving drug use, womanising and gambling, North Korean media has announced. The unprecedented and lengthy dispatch from the state news agency KCNA followed claims of the purge last week by South Korean legislators briefed by Seoul\u2019s spy agency. Less than two years since becoming leader, Kim has made sweeping changes to the power apparatus in North Korea. Another key figure who had been seen as a mentor \u2013 Ri Yong Ho, then military chief \u2013 was removed due to \u201cill health\u201d last year. But the toppling of Jang is remarkable because he is being attacked so publicly and aggressively, and because of his family ties. The North Korean state broadcaster showed a photograph of him being forcibly removed from the meeting that announced his fate by two uniformed men. \u201cIt is the most prominent disgrace of an official in North Korea\u2019s entire history,\u201d said Andrei Lankov, an expert on the North at Kookmin University, who noted that the whole front page of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper was devoted to Jang. \u201cPurges in the past have seldom touched members of the family; the only precedent I remember was in the mid-70s when the brother of Kim Il-sung was removed. As far as I understand there was no official accusation brought against him; he was simply sent to the countryside. \u201cSecondly, when they have purged people in the past it was mentioned in passing. \u201cIt tells us something about the new leadership\u2019s style: the young man seems really tough and brutal in dealing with people he wants to destroy.\u201d Jang had been purged twice before but rose again towards the end of Kim Jong-il\u2019s life as the leader sought to ensure a smooth succession for his son, picking his brother-in-law to help ease the transition. KCNA said Kim Jong-un \u201cguided\u201d the Sunday politburo meeting that removed Jang from all his posts and expelled him from the ruling Workers Party. It accused Jang of anti-party, counter-revolutionary factional acts and criminal acts \"baffling imagination\". It said he had disobeyed Kim despite repeated warnings. \u201cJang pretended to uphold the party and leader but was engrossed in such factional acts as dreaming different dreams and involving himself in double-dealing behind the scene,\u201d it said. \u201cPrompted by his politically-motivated ambition, he tried to increase his force and build his base for realising it by implanting those who had been punished for their serious wrongs in the past period into ranks of officials of departments of the party central committee and units under them.\u201d Lankov said such accusations of faction-building were standard in North Korean purges, although their prominence this time was unusual. Daniel Pinkston, north-east Asia deputy project director at the International Crisis Group, said: \u201cIt is all about power politics ... [In a centralised dictatorship] you have to spend a lot of time monitoring who is loyal and disloyal \u2013 and the greatest challenge are the closest confidantes like Jang and Ri Song Yo. \u201cJang had things he could do for the Kim family, but if he\u2019s worn out his welcome, why keep him around? This is the political economy of dictatorship. \u201cIt is time for the younger generation. Kim has an opportunity and if he is a prudent and pragmatic ruler will be putting in people loyal to him.\u201d The KCNA report said Jang had \u201cseriously obstructed the nation's economic affairs and the improvement of the standard of people's living\u201d. It went on: \u201cAffected by the capitalist way of living, Jang committed irregularities and corruption and led a dissolute and depraved life. \u201cBy abusing his power, he was engrossed in irregularities and corruption, had improper relations with several women and was wined and dined at back parlours of deluxe restaurants. \u201cIdeologically sick and extremely idle and easy-going, he used drugs and squandered foreign currency at casinos while he was receiving medical treatment in a foreign country under the care of the party.\" Images of Jang were removed from a propaganda film reshown by the North this week and the state news agency appears to have been removing or amending old reports which included him. Pinkston said: \u201cI imagine because of his marriage ties he will probably just get permanent house arrest, but his underlings and confidants and \u2018co-conspirators\u2019 may not be so lucky.\u201d Two of Jang\u2019s close aides are believed to have been executed recently. South Korean media claimed last week that an aide who managed funds for him has sought asylum from Seoul. The cable news network YTN and the Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper said the man was being protected by South Korean officials in a secret location in China.",
