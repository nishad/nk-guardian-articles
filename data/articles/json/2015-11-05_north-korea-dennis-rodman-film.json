    "content": "Colin Offland\u2019s film about Dennis Rodman\u2019s trip to North Korea is a rollercoaster of a documentary. Following the former Chicago Bulls basketball player and a motley crew of his fellow ex-NBA colleagues, the film \u2013 called Dennis Rodman\u2019s Big Bang in Pyongyang \u2013 depicts the group\u2019s efforts to bring peace to the troubled Korean peninsula by organising a basketball game, while also throwing the leader Kim Jong-un a \u201cbirthday party to remember\u201d. But it doesn\u2019t all go according to plan. The film follows the events as \u2013 amid massive press coverage and criticism of Rodman \u2013 sponsors pull out and tempers fray. It\u2019s a tragicomedy, balancing the absurdity of the Rodman\u2019s friendship with the leader of the secretive state with a sympathetic and nuanced eye not usually seen in documentaries about the DPRK. Offland says he first stumbled on the story in 2013, when Rodman, in collaboration with gambling company Paddy Power, announced he was returning to North Korea to put on a basketball game. He\u2019d been to the country before, in February 2013 with Vice and the Harlem Globetrotters (an exhibition basketball team), and having befriended the great leader on his first trip, Rodman was going back to train the national team and organise a US-North Korea game. \u201c[When] I read that announcement, I was sitting at breakfast with my children, and for some reason I said to them \u2018I\u2019m gonna make a film of that\u2019,\u201d he recalls. Offland had also visited North Korea in the past as a tourist and followed developments in the country closely. He felt that his understanding of the place made him the perfect film-maker to chronicle the trip. \u201cI just came in and told [Rodman\u2019s team] \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get away with taking a big crew in there, especially Americans\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSo then I gave them a proposal, what I thought the documentary was about, and eventually between [Paddy Power] and Rodman they granted me the rights to it. It was a scoop, actually.\u201d At the mercy of Dennis The purpose of the first trip was for Rodman to train and choose the North Korean players who would face-off against the NBA players, but for Offland and his crew it was a chance to build trust. \u201cI think actually the film was used as leverage to make the event happen, weirdly, so I\u2019m on the back of the train and then later I\u2019m driving this thing.\u201d After a relatively low-key initial trip to North Korea, Rodman and the crew arrived back in Beijing to a press fanfare. In a particularly memorable scene, they are mobbed at the airport, having to fight their way through a media scrum to escape. Much of the media coverage at the time was condemning the basketball player for his apparent friendship with Kim. This is also when things are shown to start going wrong. With the cold reality of media criticism bearing down on them, Paddy Power pulls out of the event, and under extreme stress, Rodman begins binge drinking and starts behaving erratically. By their first evening back in Pyongyang \u2013 this time with the ex-NBA stars in tow \u2013 it\u2019s clear that Rodman is no longer in control. In a particularly disturbing scene, he gets intoxicated at a state banquet held in his honour on the first night, and begins veering between singing jovial karaoke one minute and angry hollering the next. \u201cWhen he was going off I was thinking \u2018Oh my god we\u2019re at the mercy of Dennis\u2019s behaviour here much more than I\u2019d anticipated\u2019,\u201d says Offland. Rodman\u2019s behaviour is seen to take its toll on the team. In another scene the other NBA players suggest they might pack it all in and go home. It\u2019s around this point in the film\u2019s chronology that Rodman makes his now infamous appearance on CNN, where he rejected calls to assist in the release of American prisoner Kenneth Bae and shouted at interviewer Chris Cuomo. Offland, however, says he never worried his project would be jeopardised. \u201cAnything that was gonna happen was going to be interesting,\u201d he says. The game The game itself is the highlight of the film. The NBA players dramatically underestimated the speed and skill of their opponents, and are narrowly defeated by the North Koreans in an exhilarating match. At the end of play, Kim himself makes an appearance. \u201cI\u2019ve been to European cup finals, world cup finals, some of the biggest sporting events ever,\u201d Offland says. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that atmosphere before. It was hair raising, that feeling was absolutely incredible.\u201d Amid the jubilation after the game, the possibility arises to interview the great leader. Rodman and the crew are invited to spend the next few days at the Masikryong Ski Resort \u2013 with the possibly that Kim might attend. \u201cDennis was going to be the one hoping to ask the questions,\u201d says Offland. \u201c You know, that would have been the biggest scoop of all time. \u201cDennis had asked me what I\u2019d ask [Kim]. My question would have been: \u2018Why did you want this event?\u2019 I wasn\u2019t going for anything more in depth than that \u2013 any question I was going to ask was going to be in the context of the match.\u201d But the interview didn\u2019t happen. Instead, Rodman\u2019s drinking continued throughout the trip, Kim didn\u2019t show up, and the crew flew back a few days later. \u201cI\u2019ve have to say I was personally gutted that Kim Jong-un didn\u2019t turn up,\u201d says Offland. \u201cFor me that would have meant a natural continuation of this, and more positive things could potentially happen.\u201d Despite the disappointment of the end of the film\u2019s production, Dennis Rodman\u2019s Big Bang in Pyongyang has already received critical praise for its touching portrayal of a complicated and troubled man visiting a complex country. Though Offland says he\u2019s heard from Rodman\u2019s agent that the friendship between the former Chicago Bulls player and Kim is not over, he thinks it\u2019s unlikely either of them will be heading back to North Korea \u2013 although, he points out, the result of the 2016 US presidential election might change that. \u201cWell, unless Donald Trump gets into power\u2026 you never know,\u201d he said. \u201cDennis and Donald are tight.\u201d You can now watch Dennis Rodman\u2019s Big Bang In Pyongyang on Showtime A version of this article first appeared on NK News \u2013 North Korean news",
