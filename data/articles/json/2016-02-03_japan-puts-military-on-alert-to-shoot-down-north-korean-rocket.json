    "content": "Japan has threatened to shoot down any North Korean missile that threatens its territory and has deployed ballistic missile defence units in preparation for what officials in Pyongyang says is the imminent launch of a satellite. Japan\u2019s defence minister, Gen Nakatani, on Wednesday ordered the deployment of Aegis destroyers in the Sea of Japan and Patriot missile batteries on land, hours after North Korea confirmed that it was preparing to launch the satellite \u2013 an act that would inevitably use a banned long-range rocket. North Korea has informed the International Maritime Organisation, a UN agency, that it planned to launch the Kwangmyongsong earth observation satellite sometime between 8 and 25 February. Among the most likely dates for the launch is 16 February, the birthday of Kim Jong-il, father of the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. North Korea insists its rocket launches are for strictly civilian purposes, but the US, Japan and South Korea suspect that the regime uses them to conduct covert tests of long-range missile technology. UN security council resolutions ban North Korea from carrying out nuclear tests and developing its ballistic missile capabilities. \u201cToday the defence minister issued an order\u201d to destroy such a missile if it \u201cis confirmed that it will fall on Japanese territory\u201d, Japan\u2019s defence ministry said in a statement. Nakatani had issued the order, citing the \u201cpossibility that North Korea will launch a missile it calls a \u2018satellite\u2019 within coming days\u201d, the statement added. Nakatani told reporters: \u201cWe want to take all possible measures to be ready to deal with any eventuality.\u201d Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, called the possible launch a \u201cserious provocation\u201d, adding that he would work with the US and South Korea to demand that Pyongyang abandon the planned launch. \u201cIf North Korea goes ahead and launches the rocket, it would clearly violate UN security council resolutions and pose a serious provocation,\u201d Abe said in parliament. \u201cThe reality is that it is a launch of a ballistic missile.\u201d South Korea also warned Pyongyang against going ahead with the launch. \u201cWe warn that if North Korea proceeds with a long-range missile launch, the international society will ensure that the North pays searing consequences for it,\u201d said senior South Korean presidential official Cho Tae-yong. North Korea is thought to have made progress towards developing a nuclear warhead small enough to be mounted on a missile capable of striking the US mainland, but experts believe the country is some way off perfecting an inter-continental ballistic missile capability. \u201cNorth Korea is still a long way off from being able to strike the US mainland,\u201d Siegfried Hecker, a leading authority on Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, told AFP recently. \u201cIt has only had one successful space launch. It needs a lot more, but it has made a large effort in that direction.\u201d The prospect of a missile launch has sparked widespread condemnation, as the UN deliberates a fresh round of sanctions in response to North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test early last month. Pyongyang claimed it had tested a hydrogen bomb for the first time, but experts believe that residual evidence and the size of the seismic shock point to a far less powerful device. Japan has been developing its missile defence capability since 1998, when a North Korean Taepodong-1 missile flew over its territory before landing in the Pacific. Japan\u2019s missile defence options include PAC-3 surface-to-air anti-ballistic missiles positioned on land, including in central Tokyo, and SM-3 interceptors mounted on warships equipped with Aegis radar systems. North Korea\u2019s last long-range rocket launch, in December 2012, was seen as having successfully put the country\u2019s first communications satellite into orbit after several failed attempts. South Korea, meanwhile, warned that its neighbour would pay a \u201csevere price\u201d if it went ahead with the launch. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s notice of the plan to launch a long-range missile, coming at a time when there is a discussion for security council sanctions on its fourth nuclear test, is a direct challenge to the international community,\u201d the presidential Blue House in Seoul said in a statement. \u201cWe strongly warn that the North will pay a severe price \u2026 if it goes ahead with the long-range missile launch plan.\u201d In Washington, US state department spokesman John Kirby said the UN security council needed to \u201csend the North Koreans a swift, firm message\u201d.",
