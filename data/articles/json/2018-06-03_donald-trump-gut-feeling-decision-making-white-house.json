    "content": "Such a photograph would, it is fair to assume, have been beyond the most delirious, hallucinatory imaginings of a tropical fever patient five years ago. Donald Trump sits at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office with hands folded and a broad grin. To his right, dressed in black, stands an unsmiling Kim Kardashian West, a reality TV superstar catapulted to fame a decade ago by a sex tape. \u201c\u2018I broke the internet.\u2019 \u2018I broke the country!\u2019\u201d parodied Comedy Central\u2019s the Daily Show in response. The journalist Tom Gara of BuzzFeed News tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that the most powerful person in the world is just taking casual meetings with Trump like this.\u201d And as preparations continue for talks with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, the NBC correspondent Peter Alexander posted: \u201cThe other Kim summit.\u201d Trump himself tweeted simply that it was a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d at which they \u201ctalked about prison reform and sentencing\u201d, glazing over Kardashian\u2019s somewhat dubious qualifications as a White House policy guru. But then, the 45th US president appears to have dispensed with expertise or a trusted inner circle. The doors of his Oval Office have been thrown open to the national security adviser one minute, a famous face from Keeping Up with the Kardashians the next. As Trump approaches 500 days in office, unleashing a daily barrage of remarks, tweets, insults, pardons and threats, teeing up a global trade war and chasing an on-off-on meeting with Kim, the restraints are off and the fabled \u201cadults in the room\u201d appear scarcer than ever. It is, critics say, not so much a team of rivals as a team of one. Donald Trump. Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a fuller picture of it now. He\u2019s not a president who thinks he needs anybody. This is the \u2018I\u2019 presidency. You hear it in every speech and see it in every tweet: it\u2019s always about himself. As in all things, his presidency will rise and fall on his own efforts.\u201d Once it was thought that rival White House factions would compete to shape the Trump presidency. But talk of a fight to the death between the \u201cglobalist-Goldman Sachs\u201d wing and the \u201cpopulist-nationalist\u201d wing has faded into the background noise of individual egos. It\u2019s now a war of all against all, multiple media reports suggest. A feud between the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro, for example, is said to have erupted in a shouting match last month on the sidelines of trade talks in China. According to the Axios website, Kelly Sadler, who had made a derogatory comment about the ailing senator John McCain, told Trump in front of colleagues that she thought her boss, Mercedes Schlapp, was one of the worst leakers in the White House. Schlapp \u201cpushed back aggressively\u201d and defended herself as the president looked on, Axios said. Steele commented: \u201cHe gets almost a sadistic pleasure watching his staff form up camps, go after each other, tear each other down. What he did not expect from his business background was the leaks. There was one agenda at Trump Tower; there is not one agenda at the White House. What he\u2019s learned is that people come into it with their own agenda. But by and large he gets his kicks from watching the staff behave like children on a playground.\u201d The list of departures is long and includes his communications director Hope Hicks, likened to a surrogate daughter, and his chief strategist Steve Bannon, likened to Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII. Neither has been replaced. \u201cHe\u2019s his own communications director; that job is still vacant,\u201d Steele added. \u201cHe\u2019s his own chief strategist: he goes by his gut. He\u2019s his own policy person: again he goes by his gut.\u201d In the past week alone, that gut instinct has led Trump to: slap hefty steel and aluminum tariffs on allies Canada, the European Union and Mexico, risking a global trade war; abruptly reinstate the Kim summit in Singapore on 12 June while saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to use the term \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 any more\u201d; accuse the New York Times of making up a source when in fact it was quoting a White House official who briefed numerous reporters; make 35 claims that were untrue at a rally in Nashville, according to a Washington Post count; declare that he wished he chose someone other than Jeff Sessions as attorney general; insist that he did not fire the FBI director James Comey over the Russia investigation, despite having admitted doing so in a TV interview, and continue to push his baseless \u201cSpygate\u201d theory; and react to comedian Roseanne Barr\u2019s racist joke with self-pity rather than condemnation. Then there was the curious episode of a presidential pardon for the conservative author and film-maker Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to violating federal campaign finance laws (and who once referred to Barack Obama as a \u201cboy\u201d from the \u201cghetto\u201d ). The president also ruminated about pardons for the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich and the TV personality Martha Stewart, both of whom had links to his show The Apprentice. It was widely speculated that he is sending a signal to aides questioned by the special counsel Robert Mueller: stay loyal and all will be forgiven. Typically a chief of staff would be expected to intervene and save a president from himself. John Kelly, who succeeded Reince Priebus in the job, never had much control over Trump\u2019s Twitter finger and is now seen as a diminished force who no longer has the president\u2019s ear. Even Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, seems a bit-part player these days. By contrast, the newest faces in the West Wing have a reputation for reaffirming Trump and making him feel good about himself. His national security adviser, John Bolton, economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani seem to indulge rather than check their boss\u2019s impulses. Bob Shrum, a 74-year-old Democratic strategist, said: \u201cThis is the first president in my memory, including Richard Nixon, who only listens to people who agree with him. I think it\u2019s gotten worse. If there\u2019s any change, it\u2019s in the direction of impulsive, unilateral, unconsidered decision making.\u201d Giuliani, a septuagenarian, thrice married New Yorker prone to incoherent interviews, and who has been working overtime to discredit Mueller, seems a natural fit. He and Trump are, the satirist John Oliver observed, \u201cbasically two versions of the same person.\u201d Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer, said: \u201cTrump is a salesman and now he has a deputy salesman. He doesn\u2019t regard Giuliani as a rival; Giuliani is there specifically because he can get headlines and attention. Now Trump has two distraction machines: two spinning tops are much better than one. It doesn\u2019t matter if they contradict themselves because they get two headlines.\u201d Trump\u2019s management style is familiar from his decades as a chief executive in the cut-throat Manhattan property world, Blair added. \u201cIt\u2019s what he always did: he\u2019s the hub of the wheel and everyone else is a spoke. He sets everyone against each other and without overlapping duties so their only loyalty is to him. It\u2019s constant upheaval: first someone is up, then they\u2019re in the doghouse. He loves them and then he fires them. It\u2019s what he\u2019s done his whole career.\u201d She observed: \u201cIf you\u2019re named Trump, you\u2019re probably pretty safe, although there have been a couple of wives thrown under the bus.\u201d",
