    "content": "Welcome to the land where the streets are full of children playing and there is no litter on the ground. Where there is respect for elders and \u201cthe state provides everything\u201d. A land where there is \u201ca splendid sense of community\u201d. Sound familiar? It may not be the usual verdict on North Korea; there is, for instance, a distinct absence of any reference to forced labour, hunger or personality cults. But this is North Korea nonetheless \u2013 as seen through the eyes of one of Italy\u2019s political party leaders. Matteo Salvini, head of the right-wing Northern League, has returned from a five-day visit to North Korea and has warm words for the country, which, according to the United Nations, \u201cdoes not have any parallel in the contemporary world\u201d in terms of human rights abuses. \u201cI am happy to have gone,\u201d Salvini told Italian daily Corriere della Sera. \u201cI saw a splendid sense of community. Many children playing in the streets and not not on play stations. A great respect for older people. Things that no longer exist in Italy.\u201d When the journalist pointed out concerns over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme and its human rights violations, Salvini was quoted as responding: \u201cWhile I would not swap my life for the one they lead in North Korea, the death penalty also exists in the United States. And as far as freedom of the press is concerned, ok, there they do nothing but talk of the Supreme Leader, but here don\u2019t people sing [prime minister Matteo] Renzi\u2019s praises every day?\u201d Salvini travelled to North Korea with another Italian politician, Antonio Razzi, a senator in Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s centre-right Forza Italia party. He told Il Fatto Quotidiano last year that North Korea reminded him of Switzerland, praising people\u2019s punctuality and their \u201cvery, very clean\u201d streets. While the Northern League is also known for its xenophobic rhetoric, it appears Salvini has a lot of time for the North Korean way of doing things. He said the country operated according to \u201canother model which I do not demonise\u201d. \u201cThere, the state provides everything: school, housing, work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American lifestyle is not the only one that exists in the world.\u201d He went on to criticise the trade restrictions slapped on Pyongyang by the west as \u201cidiotic\u201d. North Korea, he added, represented a \u201chuge opportunity for our [Italy\u2019s] businesspeople.\u201d Salvini\u2019s bizarre remarks sparked a mixture of condemnation and satire on social media on Wednesday. \u201cSalvini\u2019s comments on North Korea prove that anyone who votes [for the Northern League] is a danger to themselves and others,\u201d wrote economist Michele Boldrin on Twitter. \u201cGuys we\u2019re in talks to send Razzi and Salvini to North Korea for good,\u201d joked Luca Alagna, a digital media strategist. \u201cLet\u2019s please focus.\u201d",
