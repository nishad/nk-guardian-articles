    "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s decision to attack Syria had also been designed to intimidate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a Chinese newspaper has claimed, as G7 foreign ministers meet to discuss the fallout from last week\u2019s missile incursion. The state-run Global Times said a US strike against North Korea would unleash carnage on the Korean peninsula. The US navy has deployed a strike group towards the western Pacific Ocean, to provide a presence near the Korean peninsula. South Korean officials suspect Kim may be planning to hold his country\u2019s sixth nuclear test later this week to mark the 105th anniversary of the birth of founder Kim Il-sung on 15 April, an event a number of foreign journalists have been invited to cover. In an editorial entitled: \u2018After Syria strikes, will North Korea be next?\u2019, the Global Times suggested the US might now be preparing to launch \u201csimilar actions\u201d against Pyongyang and warned of catastrophic consequences if it did. \u201cA symbolic strike against North Korea by the US would bring a disaster to the people in Seoul,\u201d the newspaper said, claiming a \u201cdecapitation attack\u201d on North Korea was now \u201chighly possible\u201d. Such a strike would \u201cvery likely evolve into large-scale bloody war on the peninsula\u201d. The Global Times noted the decision to deploy a strike force to the Western Pacific over the weekend and cautioned Pyongyang against doing anything that might further inflame the situation. \u201cNew nuclear tests will meet with unprecedented reactions from the international community, even to a turning point.\u201d The warnings came after the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, claimed that the situation in North Korea had \u201creached a certain level of threat that action has to be taken\u201d. Asked if the attack on Syria could be seen as a message to Pyongyang, Tillerson told ABC: \u201cThe message that any nation can take is: \u2018If you violate international norms, if you violate international agreements, if you fail to live up to commitments, if you become a threat to others, at some point a response is likely to be undertaken.\u201d On Sunday, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, HR McMaster, told Fox News the US president had asked for a range of options to \u201cremove\u201d the threat posed to the American people and their allies by Kim Jong-un. Accoridng to NBC, those options include sending nuclear weapons to South Korea and killing Kim Jong-un and other senior members of North Korea\u2019s government and military. The escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and the conflict in Syria look set to dominate a two-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Tuscany which starts on Monday. Foreign ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan are expected to use the meeting to press Tillerson for answers about the White House\u2019s intentions towards Syria\u2019s leader Bashar al-Assad. Washington has sent conflicting messages on the subject since last week with the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, describing regime change as a priority but Tillerson claiming the fight against Islamic State was the US\u2019 key goal. \u201c[They are] navigating aimlessly in the dark,\u201d a senior European diplomat told Reuters. Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert from Beijing\u2019s Renmin University, said by attacking Syria Trump had killed four birds with one stone. He had projected strength; dealt a blow to Assad; and piled pressure on China which he has accused of not doing enough to rein in Pyongyang. The US president had also sent an unmistakable signal to Kim Jong-un. \u201cBy launching the strike on Syria, Trump has sent a clear message: that the US is certainly willing to use force, and that North Korea should think carefully before taking any action. The chance of Trump using force in North Korea has gone up,\u201d Cheng said. The \u201chidden motive\u201d of Trump\u2019s air strikes on Syria was a warning to North Korea, the Chinese academic claimed. \u201cChina is worried about the current situation.\u201d Additional reporting by Wang Zhen",
