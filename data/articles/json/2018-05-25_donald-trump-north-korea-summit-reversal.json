    "content": "Donald Trump has suggested his summit with Kim Jong-un could still go on as planned, marking yet another dramatic reversal for the US president who just a day earlier canceled the meeting in a letter to the North Korean leader. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday, adding that his administration was in talks with Pyongyang and the summit was still possible on its originally scheduled date of 12 June. \u201cThey very much want to do it. We\u2019d like to do it,\u201d he added. Asked if North Korea was playing games, Trump responded, \u201cEverybody plays games.\u201d Trump tweeted later on Friday that the US was having \u201cvery productive talks\u201d with Pyongyang about the possible summit. The president\u2019s comments came after North Korea said it was still willing to engage in direct talks, calling the planned summit between Trump and Kim \u201cdesperately necessary\u201d. \u201cWe express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the US and resolve issues anytime and in any format,\u201d North Korea\u2019s vice foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan said in a statement. \u201cOur commitment to doing our best for the sake of peace and stability for the world and the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged, and we are open-minded in giving time and opportunity to the US.\u201d Earlier on Friday, Trump welcomed the statement as \u201cwarm and productive\u201d. \u201cWe will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace,\u201d he tweeted. North Korea\u2019s response moved to place the blame for the failed meeting on the US. It has consistently worked to portray itself as the driver of progress in a relationship that has remained hostile for over six decades. Kim Jong-un has been crafting an image of a responsible statesman against an erratic Trump. \u201cInternally we have been quietly giving President Trump high marks for making a decision no other American president had the courage to pursue,\u201d Kim Kye-gwan said. Trump abruptly called off the summit \u2013 which was set to take place in Singapore \u2013 on Thursday, blaming \u201ctremendous anger and open hostility\u201d in recent North Korean statements. But Pyongyang said Trump\u2019s \u201cunilateral cancellation of the summit was unexpected and very regrettable\u201d. US officials also complained North Koreans did not show up to preparatory meetings and would not answer calls. US allies in Asia were blindsided by Trump\u2019s cancelation. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, called an emergency meeting just before midnight local time, saying: \u201cI am very perplexed and it is very regrettable that the North Korea-US summit will not be held. \u201cDenuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace are historic tasks that can neither be abandoned nor delayed,\u201d Moon said. A photo of the meeting released by the presidential office showed Moon with a deep frown. North Korea \u201cremains sincere in \u2026 making efforts on denuclearization and peace building\u201d, said Cho Myoung-gyon, the South\u2019s minister in charge of inter-Korean affairs. Japan\u2019s foreign minister, Taro Kono, said it was \u201cmeaningless to hold a summit if it does not bring about progress\u201d, but added he would continue to support the idea of a Trump-Kim meeting at a later date. \u201cThe important thing is not the meeting itself but that there are opportunities to move towards resolving the nuclear and missile issues,\u201d the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters. John Tierney, executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said: \u201cThe first rule of diplomacy is to always consult your allies, yet our key allies in the region were blindsided by the move. President Trump can blame North Korea\u2019s hostile rhetoric for his decision, but the reality is that the Trump administration had no unified diplomatic strategy from the beginning.\u201d Jim Mattis, the US defense secretary, told reporters that diplomats were working to get the summit back on track and said there could be \u201cpossibly some good news\u201d. National security experts were nonetheless left puzzled by the mixed messages coming out of the White House, which some argued would undermine talks. \u201cOfficial statements by the president were once taken as their word,\u201d said Samantha Vinograd, who served on Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council and also served under the Bush administration. \u201cIn the span of 24 hours, we\u2019ve gone from President Trump writing an actual letter to Kim canceling the summit, to a day later saying the summit might be back on. \u201cWhy does anyone believe him? Would this lead any other world leader, whether an ally or an enemy, to think it\u2019s just a negotiating tactic? Vinograd also questioned how the Trump administration planned to engage with Pyongyang on policy if the conversation was so fixated on logistics. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give me a lot of confidence that we\u2019ve made progress with the North Koreans on the substance of the negotiations,\u201d she said. Senator Lindsey Graham, a hawkish Republican from South Carolina, said he had spoken with Trump directly and insisted the president was still committed to the negotiations. \u201cHe\u2019s made a decision \u2013 the president has \u2013 that he\u2019s going to end North Korea\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d Graham told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s only a question of how and when.\u201d The Associated Press contributed reporting",
