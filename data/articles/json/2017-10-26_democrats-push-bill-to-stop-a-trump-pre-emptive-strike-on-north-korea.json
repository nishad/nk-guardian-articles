    "content": "Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation aimed at preventing Donald Trump from launching a pre-emptive attack on North Korea, as concerns grew about the administration\u2019s failure to explore talks with Pyongyang. The \u201cNo Unconstitutional Strike against North Korea\u201d bill is the second legislative attempt to curtail\u2019s Trump power to start a war unilaterally. Earlier this year, a bill was introduced to prohibit the president from ordering a nuclear first strike against a foreign adversary without a declaration of war by Congress, amid concerns over Trump\u2019s belligerent language, erratic behaviour and frequent tweeted threats against other countries. The new legislation prohibiting an attack on North Korea without congressional authority was launched by Democrats John Conyers in the House and Ed Markey in the Senate. It has two Republicans among the 61 backers in the House, but at present no formal Republican backing in the Senate. \u201cAs a veteran of the Korean war, I am ashamed that our commander-in-chief is conducting himself in a reckless manner that endangers our troops stationed in South Korea and our regional allies,\u201d Conyers said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s provocative and escalatory rhetoric, with threats to unleash \u2018fire and fury\u2019 and \u2018totally destroy\u2019 North Korea, cannot be allowed to turn into reality,\u201d Senator Markey said. \u201cAs long as President Trump has a Twitter account, we must ensure that he cannot start a war or launch a nuclear first strike without the explicit authorization of Congress.\u201d The bill\u2019s supporters acknowledge that it will not pass without attracting more Republican support, but they argue that it helps focus attention on the unlimited authority of a US president to order the use of nuclear weapons, many of which can be launched within a few minutes. No official has the power to stop or even delay the launch. Senator Dianne Feinstein, speaking at a conference organised by the Ploughshares Fund, an non-proliferation advocacy group said she once asked a former head of US Strategic Command if he would carry out a launch order even if he knew it was a catastrophically bad decision. \u201cHe looked me straight in the eye and said: Yes,\u201d Senator Feinstein recalled. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have reached critical levels since Pyongyang carried out a sixth nuclear test in September and a series of long-range missile tests. Trump has tweeted a series of threats against the regime and declared at the UN in September that he could \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea. Meanwhile, Trump and his administration have given mixed signals on whether they would consider any kind of dialogue with Pyongyang, and no overtures appear to have been made in that direction. NBC News reported on Thursday that Joseph Yun, the top American diplomat on North Korean issues, has been warning of a breakdown in diplomatic efforts at meetings in Congress and seeking help in persuading the White House to give negotiations a chance. William Perry, a former US defence secretary and a veteran of the Cuban missile crisis, said there was a rising danger of the US stumbling into a war with North Korea by making Pyongyang think a \u201cdecapitation strike\u201d is imminent and panicking it into launching its own nuclear weapons. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is making the regime think they are about to go, so they might as well go out in a blaze of glory,\u201d Perry said, adding that the best thing Congress could do to stop the drift to nuclear war was to pass the Conyers-Markey legislation. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem now it can be passed, but things can change,\u201d he said. Ted Lieu, the Democratic congressman who co-authored the bill in January to limit the president\u2019s power to launch a first strike said the best recruiter for Republican support was Trump\u2019s behaviour. \u201cEvery time the president does something erratic, which is every day, we get more co-sponsors,\u201d Lieu said.",
