    "content": "Theresa May has urged China to intervene more vigorously in curbing North Korea\u2019s missile ambitions, calling Beijing \u201cthe key\u201d to defusing tensions as she arrived in Japan for a three-day visit. The British prime minister, who was to hold the first of several rounds of meetings with her counterpart, Shinzo Abe, on Wednesday, touched down a day-and-a-half after North Korea fired a missile over the north of Japan, sparking a major regional security scare. Speaking to reporters on her plane en route to Kyoto, the ancient former capital where she is beginning the trip, May declined several times to rule out the possibility of military action against North Korea. However, she repeatedly stressed that the UK\u2019s focus remained on joint international efforts to limit Pyongyang\u2019s missile programme, saying the country\u2019s neighbour and sometime ally, China, should do more to assist this. Calling the firing of the missile, which triggered emergency sirens as it flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido before breaking apart over the sea \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201ca provocation\u201d, May urged the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to do more. \u201cChina has, I think, a very key role to play in terms of the pressure it can bring,\u201d May said.\u201cI have said this to President Xi, other have as well. We think that China has a role to play and we\u2019d encourage China to do everything it can to bring pressure on North Korea to stop this.\u201d Pressed on whether the UK could back or be involved in military action, or seek to use cyber attacks to blunt North Korea\u2019s efforts, May reiterated the need for joint action, with China at the centre. \u201cWhat is the UK doing? What we\u2019re doing is working with our international partners,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to continue to bring pressure on North Korea to ensure that they desist this action. And we see that the best way of doing is for China to be bringing pressure to bear on North Korea.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s about the sort of pressure and change that China can bring. I think they\u2019re a key player in this. In terms of what\u2019s we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re looking to work with our partners. But crucially, we see China as being the key in this.\u201d The visit to Japan, May\u2019s first to the country, will see her meet Abe in Kyoto before the pair take the Shinkansen bullet train to Tokyo. Security and defence had always been a planned element of the trip, with May due to address Japan\u2019s national security council and visit one of its warships on Thursday. Visiting in the immediate aftermath of the missile incident \u201cgives me a particular opportunity to sit down with Prime Minister Abe and talk to him about this issue\u201d, May said. The planned primary focus of the trip had been trade, with May accompanied by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and a 15-strong delegation of business leaders, including executives from Aston Martin, Atkins, Barclays and Standard Life. Speaking ahead of her arrival, May said she wanted to use her talks with Abe to push progress on an ongoing Japan-EU trade agreement. The aim was that this could then be immediately adapted, post-Brexit, as the model for an interim Japan-UK deal, she said, giving continuity to businesses, saying this could also happen elsewhere. \u201cWe think it is an important deal for the EU, and yes, when we leave the European Union we are looking, obviously, at a number of trade deals that the EU has with other countries,\u201d said May, who ends her trip on Friday with a meeting with Emperor Akihito. \u201cWe are looking at the possibility of those being able to brought over, certainly initially, into trade deals with the United Kingdom. It would give business certainty, which is what business wants, at the point we leave. \u201cWe will continue to press the EU to move forward on the Japan deal, which of course they\u2019ve made initial steps on, but there\u2019s a way to go.\u201d Ahead of May\u2019s initial talks with Abe, a special adviser to the Japanese prime minister said there was uneasiness about Brexit within the Japanese business community. Tomohiko Taniguchi told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that comments earlier in the week by Japan\u2019s deputy chief cabinet secretary about Brexit bringing a sense of \u201ccrisis\u201d had been possibly overblown. \u201cA sense of crisis may be a little bit (of) a strong word, but there certainly exists a sense of uneasiness, widely shared by the Japanese industrialists,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think they are telling themselves that now is the time for them to see what is going to happen down the road, rather than jumping into a uneasy conclusion.\u201d Taniguchi said it was understood that no formal trade deal talks could begin until after the UK quits the EU, but said Japanese industrialists had an \u201cinherent preference\u201d for doing business in Britain.",
