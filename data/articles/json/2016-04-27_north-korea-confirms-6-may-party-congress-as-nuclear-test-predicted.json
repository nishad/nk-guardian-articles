    "content": "North Korea has announced its ruling Workers\u2019 party congress will take place on 6 May \u2013 a landmark event that analysts suggest will be preceded by another banned nuclear test. It is the first such conference in 36 years and analysts expect North Korea to formally adopt leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s byongjin policy: simultaneously pushing for economic development and nuclear weapons capability. The summit will be watched closely for indications of how it will present its internationally banned pursuit of nuclear weapons. North Korea\u2019s last party conference was held in 1980, before the birth of Kim, who is believed to be 33. Byongjin follows Kim\u2019s father\u2019s policy of songun, or \u201cmilitary first\u201d, and his grandfather\u2019s juche, the North\u2019s home-grown founding ideology that combines Marxism and extreme nationalism. North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and has pushed ahead with ballistic missile development in defiance of UN sanctions and international warnings. It is seen to be readying another nuclear test and missile launches in the run-up to the conference despite new UN sanctions imposed in March. The last congress of the Workers\u2019 party was held in 1980 under the rule of Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the state founder. Kim Jong-un\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, who died in December 2011, never held a ruling party congress. \u201cThe Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the WPK decides to open the Seventh Congress of the WPK in Pyongyang on May 6 2016,\u201d state news agency KCNA said. WPK stands for the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea. With Reuters",
