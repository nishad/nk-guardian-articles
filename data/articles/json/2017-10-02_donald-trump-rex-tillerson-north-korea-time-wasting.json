    "content": "US officials have attempted to play down Donald Trump\u2019s opposition to the possibility of talks with North Korea, saying the president and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, were in agreement on how to deal with the regime. A day after Tillerson said the US had direct lines of communication to North Korea and was \u201cprobing\u201d to find ways to resolve escalating nuclear tension between the two countries, Trump tweeted that his top diplomat should \u201csave his energy\u201d as \u201cwe\u2019ll do what has to be done!\u201d \u201cI told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful secretary of state, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,\u201d the president wrote, from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and using the nickname he has adopted for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Later on a Sunday afternoon Trump was scheduled to spend at the Presidents Cup golf tournament, at Liberty National in New Jersey, he added: \u201cBeing nice to Rocket Man hasn\u2019t worked in 25 years, why would it work now? Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won\u2019t fail.\u201d But a state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, and Tillerson\u2019s chief public affairs adviser, R C Hammond, later used Twitter to deny that Washington was sending out mixed messages to the regime, and to other countries in the region. \u201cDPRK will not obtain a nuclear capability,\u201d Nauert wrote, using the country\u2019s official title, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. \u201cWhether through diplomacy or force is up to the regime, she continued, \u201cDiplomatic channels are open for \u001dKimJongUn for now. They won\u2019t be open forever @StateDept @potus.\u201d Hammond, meanwhile, said Trump\u2019s tweets were not a rebuke to Tillerson but were intended to send a message to Kim that time was running out for a diplomatic solution. \u201cChannels have been open for months. They\u2019ve been unused and cooling for months,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president just sent a clear message to NK: show up at the diplomatic table before the invitation gets cold,\u201d he added in another tweet. \u201cMessage to Rex? Try message to Pyongyang: step up to the diplomatic table.\u201d One senior Trump administration official played down the significance of the communication channels, which include Washington and Pyongyang\u2019s UN missions, regular exchanges between senior diplomats, and unofficial discussions between North Korean officials and former US officials. \u201cAt a time when North Korea is continuing its provocations, the president does not think now is the time to negotiate with them,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official also said diplomatic channels between Washington and Pyongyang were designed to secure the return of Americans detained by North Korea. The latest presidential Twitter outburst threatened not only to further escalate the North Korea crisis, but to undermine the nation\u2019s top diplomat at a highly sensitive moment. Tillerson was speaking in Beijing, where he met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at Washington\u2019s Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said she saw some method in Trump\u2019s messaging. \u201cI do think that when he sometimes will tweet things like: \u2018Negotiations are a waste of time, we have to move to the possibility of war\u2019, he is trying to help build some leverage for diplomacy. Ultimately there is really no solution other than diplomacy. I think even Trump knows that.\u201d Glaser said she believed such tweets were deliberately \u201caimed at scaring the North Koreans and scaring the Chinese also\u201d. \u201cWe know that the Chinese don\u2019t want war on the peninsular. The last thing they want is the US to use military force. So when he threatens that he is basically trying to bolster the prospects for alternatives [by] trying to scare the Chinese. \u201cI can\u2019t say whether [the tweeted threats] are effective with North Korea, but they are not likely effective with the Chinese,\u201d Glaser added. \u201cThe Chinese are more likely to cooperate with a US president that is consistent, predictable and reliable.\u201d Tensions between Washington and Pyongyang have grown as North Korea has tested missiles and a nuclear device, part of its aim to develop a nuclear weapon that could reach the US mainland. Several missiles fired have flown over Japan and Pyongyang threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific ocean. Trump has responded with taunts and threats, through social media and in speeches including his debut last month at the United Nations in New York which was greeted among diplomats with alarm. Tough sanctions on North Korea have been imposed through the UN and the US has promised to deploy \u201cstrategic military assets\u201d near the Korean peninsula. North Korea\u2019s foreign minister said the country would \u201cshoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country\u201d. Ri Yong-ho also said at the UN it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that his country would fire missiles at the US mainland, and said Trump had declared war. Trump\u2019s latest diatribe adds to a growing list of vexations for Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil who only took the job of US secretary of state after his wife told him to. Early in the job Tillerson\u2019s choice of deputy, former diplomat Elliott Abrams, was vetoed by the president and there have been reports that Tillerson has been frustrated by the lion-sized influence over foreign policy exerted by Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Over the summer there was even speculation about a Tillerson departure, dubbed \u201cRexit\u201d. To have the US president publicly slap down a major strategic statement by the country\u2019s top diplomat just 24 hours after it was made carries its own form of humiliation. On Saturday, Tillerson told reporters in China that a channel was open with the North Korean regime. \u201cWe are probing, so stay tuned. We ask: \u2018Would you like to talk?\u2019\u201d The former oil executive then said the US had \u201ca couple of, three channels open to Pyongyang\u201d. \u201cWe can talk to them. We do talk to them,\u201d Tillerson said, although he also said \u201cwe haven\u2019t even gotten\u201d as far as establishing a dialogue. In a statement, the state department\u2019s Nauert said: \u201cNorth Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization.\u201d \u201cI think the whole situation\u2019s a bit overheated right now,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cI think everyone would like for it to calm down. Obviously it would help if North Korea would stop firing off missiles. That\u2019d calm things down a lot.\u201d On Sunday, a morning he spent stoking broiling controversies over NFL anthem protests and his reaction to a natural disaster in Puerto Rico, the president appeared to disregard such advice. Tillerson met President Xi on Saturday, saying in opening remarks that relations between the two countries would \u201cgrow and mature on the strength of the relationship between yourself and President Trump\u201d. Trump is expected to visit Beijing in November. Critical response to Trump\u2019s Twitter storm was quick to come. Ted Lieu, a Democratic member of Congress from California, said that when the president undercuts his secretary of state, \u201cit not only embarrasses Rex Tillerson, it confuses Americans &amp; world leaders\u201d. Richard Painter, a former chief ethics lawyer in the George W Bush White House, went further, warning: \u201cIf President Kennedy had acted this way during the Cuban missile crisis, we would all be dead.\u201d Trump has previously kept the door open to possible talks with North Korea. In a meeting with the Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly last month, Trump responded \u201cWhy not?\u201d when asked if talks were possible.",
