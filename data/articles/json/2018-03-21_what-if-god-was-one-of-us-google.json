    "content": "In 1995, people had a lot of questions. \u201cIs there any film Tom Hanks can\u2019t make good?\u201d \u201cWho shot Mr Burns?\u201d \u201cHow do I get out of the maze screensaver in the new Windows operating system?\u201d While all of these questions were eventually resolved (\u201cThe Terminal\u201d, \u201cMaggie Simpson\u201d and \u201cyou can\u2019t escape, this poorly animated brick labyrinth will be your tomb forever\u201d), there was one posited that year by a young singer-songwriter which has never sufficiently been answered: what if God was one of us? If you haven\u2019t heard Joan Osborne\u2019s song, it\u2019s pretty standard in the \u201c1990s female rock-pop with baffling lyrics\u201d department, up there with Des\u2019ree saying she\u2019d rather have a piece of toast than see a ghost. Osborne suggests that God could be one of us (a slob like one of us), just a stranger on the bus, trying to make his way home, which immediately raises some questions. Has God got lost? Has he accidentally turned himself into a human and now can\u2019t work out how to get back? Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 this has all the makings of a Jack Black film that I would definitely sit through on a plane (working title: \u201cLost Faith\u201d with God standing next to a signpost looking all confused, with the working tagline: \u201cLooks like the lap of the gods \u2026 could do with a satnav\u201d), but it doesn\u2019t do a huge amount to answer the central question. What\u2019s more, Osborne says at another point that no one\u2019s calling God on the phone \u2013 \u201cexcept for the pope, maybe in Rome\u201d. So in this universe, the pope knows that God has accidentally turned himself into a human, but instead of visiting him and maybe trying to arrange transport back to heaven (perhaps by pulling a few strings at Nasa), he\u2019s just calling him occasionally? What kind of lousy pope is this guy? If I\u2019m ever pope (and let\u2019s never say never), I promise I will go visit God, face-to-face, every time he\u2019s riding on a bus. Even if it\u2019s a Sunday rail replacement service. Anyway, enough about my papal campaign (but seriously, vote Bernhardt for Pope 2052) \u2013 let\u2019s get down to the matter at hand. It\u2019s pretty understandable that God, if he exists, would want to have a go at being one of us, even for a little bit. Imagine you played The Sims, non-stop, since the dawn of time \u2013 you\u2019d want to spice things up by playing an immersive first-person adventure game eventually. The big question, though, is whether God would tell his invention that he was God, or if he\u2019d keep it a secret. The first option isn\u2019t particularly deity-friendly. For one, people wouldn\u2019t necessarily believe him \u2013 anyone going around screaming that they are God is dismissed as lying, deluded or Elon Musk. Once God had actually convinced people that he was \u201cone of us\u201d, a new set of headaches would occur. The big lure of religion lies in the unknowable and intangible \u2013 if a guy with a great big bushy beard turns up and says: \u201cHi, I\u2019m the creator of man and the universe, ask me anything\u201d like he\u2019s on Reddit, the whole thing becomes less appealing. Everyone would expect him to have the answer for everything, immediately, on tap \u2013 church service would be less a sombre coming together of a community and more like people waiting in line for the Genius Bar at the Apple Store. So more than likely, God would go with the second option \u2013 where he doesn\u2019t let anyone know that he\u2019s God. There\u2019s something quite appealing about this, in a vaguely \u201cUndercover Boss\u201d kind of way \u2013 he\u2019d get some honest feedback on some of his crummier creations (mosquitos, famine, my downstairs neighbour\u2019s cat who jumps out at me and hisses for no reason, my downstairs neighbour who laughs every time this happens). Plus there\u2019s the added jeopardy for all of us, as anyone in the world could be God, judging us. The only solution, logically, would be to treat everyone as well as we\u2019d treat God, and therefore making the world a better place. At least, that\u2019s the theory. In reality, of course, humans are terrible regardless of who they think is watching them, and we will act totally by short-termist ideals regardless of the long-term consequences. Look at our attitude to global warming \u2013 we know the planet is dying but we don\u2019t really do anything about it because it\u2019s hard. Given how lousy our response is when the stakes are that high, it\u2019s difficult to believe that our behaviour would change much just because there\u2019s a tiny chance that God is walking around taking notes. People would still lie and cheat, because not even a fear of God can change our stupid natures. But then maybe that\u2019s OK. God may (or may not, I\u2019m hedging my bets here) have created humans, but today\u2019s problems are very much of our own making, and there\u2019s no real guarantee God could fix them even he was \u201cone of us\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t trust Thomas Edison to change the foglights on my car, because things have become way more complicated since he invented the first lightbulb. In my mind, it\u2019s a bit like that with God and all of our problems \u2013 I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d have particularly good advice on how to negotiate with North Korea, or how to combat systemic racism in Britain, or how to deliver a Brexit that respects the referendum result and doesn\u2019t destroy the economy. If you asked him any of those questions, he\u2019d probably stare at you blankly and then say: \u201cHey, have you seen this ostrich I made? It\u2019s got wings but it can\u2019t fly. What an idiot!\u201d To put it in an overly simplistic and corny way, we have to work together \u2013 regardless of who we believe is watching, or who is among us \u2013 to make the world a better place. And, seriously, if you\u2019re part of the College of Cardinals, put in a good word for me. \u2022 Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and occasional performer",
