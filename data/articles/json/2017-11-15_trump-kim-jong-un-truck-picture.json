    "content": "After a year of trading insults with Kim Jong-un, Trump recently seemed pained by his tense relationship with the North Korean leader. \u201cI try so hard to be his friend,\u201d tweeted Trump, seemingly oblivious that his use of mocking nicknames like \u201clittle rocket man\u201d and threats to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea may have left Kim less inclined to be Trump\u2019s pal. On balance, Kim\u2019s no better. He called Trump a \u201cmentally deranged dotard\u201d and worse still, \u201cold\u201d. But perhaps the two leaders have more in common than they realize. State media photos released on Wednesday showed a gleeful-looking Kim climbing into the cab at a tractor factory in Pyongyang \u2013 just as Trump did when truckers visited the White House in March. So can the pair\u2019s shared enjoyment of large machinery bring them together? Probably not. A recent editorial in North Korean state media deemed the president a \u201chideous criminal\u201d and sentenced him to death. It\u2019s hard to come back from that. Still, there\u2019s always Putin.",
