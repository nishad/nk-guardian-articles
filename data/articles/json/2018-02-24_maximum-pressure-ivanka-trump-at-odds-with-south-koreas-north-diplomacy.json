    "content": "Ivanka Trump is leading a US delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea in an effort to show a softer side of US diplomacy on the peninsula while calling for maximum pressure to be put on North Korea. Trump watched snowboarding events in Pyeongchang with South Korea\u2019s first lady, Kim Jung-sook, and foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha. Wearing a Team USA hat and red snowsuit, she captured the attention of local media. Her trip comes less than two weeks after Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un\u2019s younger sister, visited the South and largely overshadowed US vice president Mike Pence. \u201cWe cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country,\u201d Donald Trump said in an early morning tweet. At a dinner on Friday, Ivanka Trump\u2019s message of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d seemed to clash with South Korean president Moon Jae-in\u2019s strategy of denuclearisation through dialogue. Experts have said the North\u2019s recent diplomatic overtures are aimed at driving a wedge between Washington and Seoul, and the mixed messages suggested there may be tension between the allies. \u201cActive dialogue is being held between the South and the North amid the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics,\u201d Moon said, according to the Yonhap news agency. \u201cThis is greatly contributing to easing tension on the Korean Peninsula and improving the South-North relationship.\u201d Friday\u2019s meal featured \u201cKorean food designed to be palatable for foreigners\u201d including bibimbap, a rice dish topped with various vegetables and meat \u201cthat mixes different ingredients evenly and symbolises harmony\u201d, according to the presidential Blue House. Moon has rolled out the red carpet for Trump, who is an adviser to her father. \u201cI thank you for hosting us all here tonight as we reaffirm our bonds of friendship, of cooperation, of partnership and reaffirm our commitment to our maximum pressure campaign to ensure that the Korean Peninsula is denuclearised,\u201d she said. As Trump landed in Seoul, the US announced a new round of sanctions against Pyongyang in an effort to curb the country\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. The measures targeted 27 shipping and trading companies, 28 vessels and one person, all suspected of helping North Korea circumvent current sanctions. Washington\u2019s hard line emerged as the dominant theme of Trump\u2019s trip, with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders telling reporters: \u201cWe are going to continue a campaign of maximum pressure, the latest sanctions are the strongest that we have had on North Korea. We are going to continue in that form.\u201d The US is \u201cgoing to ask all of our allies and partners to step up and do more as well and join us in that effort,\u201d she added. Trump\u2019s visit will coincide with a high level delegation from North Korea, with both attending the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. US and South Korean officials have said there is no meeting planned between the two sides, but the possibility of direct talks had led to intense speculation. Pence was set to meet with officials from the North during his trip, but it was cancelled at the last minute.",
