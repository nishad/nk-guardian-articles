    "content": "So obviously it\u2019s a relief that the Korean Missile Crisis is over, isn\u2019t it? At least I think it\u2019s over. One moment we were talking about Armageddon and the world holding its breath. Then we heard the North Koreans\u2019 missile launch was a dud, maybe because of US cyberhackers. Then \u2026 it vanished from the news schedules. But I\u2019m still worried. Paul Mason recently wrote about the horrible way nuclear war has once again become \u201cthinkable\u201d. I know why. A whole generation has grown up who never saw the BBC television movie Threads, from 1984, written by Barry Hines and directed by Mick Jackson. It is a nuclear pre- and post-apocalypse drama, scarier than any horror. It is simply a brutal masterpiece, still available on DVD \u2013 and, incidentally, one of the BBC\u2019s finest hours. It tests the thinkability of nuclear war more than anything I have ever seen. Donald Trump, Sean Spicer and the US defence secretary, General James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, should be sat down in a room and made to watch it, in a double-bill with Peter Watkins\u2019s 1965 BBC play The War Game, with a similarly unsettling theme. I suspect that if President Trump has watched a movie on this theme it is the terrible thriller The Sum of All Fears, starring Ben Affleck as CIA tough guy Jack Ryan, a film that toughly shrugs off the immolation of Baltimore as unimportant. But it is the BBC\u2019s Threads that has helped keep the world safe. The couch and the ring The nation has united in its support for Prince Harry and his comments about the emotional turmoil he has suffered since the devastation of losing his mother 20 years ago. No one with a heart could fail to sympathise. Yet it\u2019s not exactly the historic repudiation of stiff-upper-lip mentality that saucer-eyed pundits have been claiming. Harry\u2019s interview, although admirably frank, was actually slightly less revealing, in purely personal terms, than the one his mother gave on television to the BBC\u2019s Martin Bashir. Prince Harry said that he had had some counselling, but of equal importance was his declaration that he controlled and managed his anger with boxing. I can well imagine his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, reading this and nodding vigorously in agreement. Emotional literacy? Mindfulness? Well, sure, but there\u2019s also the option of getting the boxing gloves on and working out your problems in the ring. So is the princes\u2019 Heads Together charity going to be looking into the possibility of encouraging young men to get down to the gym, pick up the skipping rope and master the non-touchy-feely art of pugilism? It was good enough for Prince Harry. All you need is tea Keeping calm and carrying on \u2013 or, in my case, going into a catatonic state of denial \u2013 has always been a workable option in a crisis. And so in these troubled times it\u2019s a relief to welcome National Tea Day \u2013 which, you will of course already know, is this Friday. All over the country, people will be making cups of tea in a celebratory manner, but the event focuses on an all-day outdoor festival at west London\u2019s Kensington Roof Gardens. I will be marking the event by making my daily 17 cups of tea, or rather mugs, with individual bags, which I will afterwards throw into my kitchen swing-bin, flicking them from the teaspoon, often just missing, and sometimes taking time out with a J-cloth to clear up the resulting mess. Because that\u2019s the great thing about tea. It\u2019s soothing, and it creates activity that delays work.",
