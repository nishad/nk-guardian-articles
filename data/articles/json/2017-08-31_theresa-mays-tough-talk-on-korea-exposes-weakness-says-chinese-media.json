    "content": "Theresa May\u2019s attempt to talk tough on North Korea has exposed a weak and vulnerable leader hobbled by June\u2019s election fiasco, a state-run Chinese newspaper has claimed. Speaking on Wednesday at the start of a three-day trip to Japan, the prime minister urged Beijing to do more to rein in the \u201coutrageous\u201d behaviour of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. \u201cWe see China as being the key in this,\u201d she told reporters, echoing calls from Donald Trump who has been trying to persuade Chinese president Xi Jinping to help thwart Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. China shrugged off May\u2019s intervention, which came after Kim\u2019s regime fired a ballistic missile over the Japanese island of Hokkaido. \u201cPeople say all kinds of things whenever the situation on the Korean peninsula becomes tense,\u201d foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing. The Global Times, a nationalist, Communist party tabloid which sometimes reflects official views, went further, attributing the prime minister\u2019s comments to this summer\u2019s botched election in which her party squandered its parliamentary majority. \u201cMay\u2019s Conservative party lost many seats, turning her into a vulnerable prime minister,\u201d argued an editorial in its Chinese language edition. \u201cWeak people often look for opportunities to show their \u2018strength\u2019.\u201d \u201cPerhaps prime minister May doesn\u2019t know much about the Korean peninsula. Her comments sounded just like a rehashing of Washington\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d the notoriously undiplomatic newspaper continued, claiming that many Chinese citizens felt \u201cpuzzled\u201d at British meddling in Asian affairs. \u201cIf the British government genuinely wants to protects its business and investment interests in the region, it should speak and act cautiously ... rather than pointing fingers and making irrelevant remarks,\u201d added the article which was headlined, \u2018Beijing does not need London to teach it how to deal with North Korea\u2019. The Global Times, an offshoot of Communist party mouthpiece the People\u2019s Daily, has made an art of ribbing Conservative prime ministers. When David Cameron flew to China in 2013, hoping to defuse a diplomatic row over his meeting with the Dalai Lama, the newspaper greeted him with the following advice: \u201cThe Cameron administration should acknowledge that the UK is not a big power in the eyes of the Chinese. It is just an old European country apart for travel and study.\u201d Additional reporting by Wang Zhen",
