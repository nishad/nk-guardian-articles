    "content": "The leaders of North and South Korea have promised after a landmark summit to bring \u201clasting peace\u201d to the peninsula with a commitment to denuclearisation and to ending decades of hostilities. Speaking at the end of an extraordinary day that began with a lingering handshake across the demarcation line separating their countries, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, issued a joint statement that was short on detail but offered cause for optimism as the world looks ahead to a summit between Kim and Donald Trump. The US president, in his first comments on the declaration, tweeted: \u201cGood things are happening, but only time will tell!\u201d He later added: \u201cKOREAN WAR TO END!\u201d Speaking at the White House, Trump warned that the US was \u201cnot going to be played\u201d by North Korea, later the US president said he was getting close to choosing a venue for talks with Kim. \u201cWe\u2019re setting up meetings now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re down to two countries... and we\u2019ll let you know what that site is.\u201d At a joint press conference with Angela Merkel, Trump said: \u201cMaximum pressure will continue until denuclearisation occurs. I look forward to our meeting, which will be quite something.\u201d The Panmunjom declaration, named after the truce village that hosted the talks on Friday, committed the two Koreas to seek the \u201ccomplete denuclearisation\u201d of the peninsula. \u201cSouth and North Korea confirmed the common goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula,\u201d it said. \u201cSouth and North Korea shared the view that the measures being initiated by North Korea are very meaningful and crucial for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and agreed to carry out their respective roles and responsibilities in this regard.\u201d The statement did not specify what Pyongyang expected in return for abandoning its nuclear weapons \u2013 the regime\u2019s best deterrent against what it regards as a hostile US. Speaking outside the peace house on the southern side of the border that has divided the Korean peninsula for 65 years, the leaders also pledged to push for talks with the US, and possibly China, to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war with a peace treaty to replace the uneasy truce that stopped hostilities. Noting that more than a decade had passed since the countries\u2019 leaders last met, Kim and Moon agreed to talk regularly by phone and meet more often, starting with a summit in Pyongyang in autumn. They vowed to work more closely on a host of bilateral issues, including reuniting families divided by the Korean war and improving cross-border transport links. Months after relations between the two countries sank to their lowest level following North Korean missile launches and its sixth nuclear test, Moon said he and Kim were aware that the hopes of 80 million North and South Koreans rested on their shoulders. \u201cWe were able to stand together today and agree that we should denuclearise the Korean peninsula,\u201d Moon said, according to a translation provided by South Korea\u2019s Arirang TV. With Kim standing nearby behind a separate podium, he said. \u201cTo completely denuclearise, we declare that we will cooperate to bring about an everlasting peace on the peninsula.\u201d Moon applauded Kim\u2019s \u201ccourage and determination\u201d and vowed that \u201cthere will be no going back\u201d to an era of tension and provocation that has occasionally brought the neighbours to the brink of conflict. \u201cWe are giving a great present to the citizens of the two Koreas,\u201d he said. The goodwill measures would begin with a halt to \u201call forms of hostility\u201d on land, at sea and in the air, the declaration said. The demilitarised zone \u2013 the heavily armed border separating the two countries \u2013 and the western maritime border will be turned into \u201cpeace zones\u201d. From Tuesday, both countries will suspend all loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts and dismantle broadcasting equipment. They will also stop sending propaganda leaflets across the border. Kim said: \u201cWe hope we will not repeat the mistake of the past. I hope this will be an opportunity for the Korean people to move freely from North to South. We need to take responsibility for our own history. \u201cWe have waited for this day for a very long time. We are tied by blood and cannot be separated \u2013 we are the same country, the same people, and should not be separated by hostility. \u201cWe hope we can open a new road towards a new future, and that is why I crossed the demarcation line today. We hope for a new era of peace, and we have reaffirmed our commitment to that.\u201d Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, said the wording of the statement was encouraging, as Kim prepares for his summit with Trump in late May or early June. \u201cIt\u2019s good that the nuclear language is in there, and including \u2018complete denuclearisation\u2019 is a win for Moon,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really aimed at setting up the meeting with Trump.\u201d But she said it would have been easy for Kim to agree to the statement since \u201cit reiterates what their position has been all along\u201d, and from Pyongyang\u2019s perspective, denuclearisation would include significant concessions from the US on its military presence in South Korea. \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, this declaration is continuing the spirit of the 2007 agreement, and much of what we see in this declaration has been agreed to before,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still a long and complicated road ahead.\u201d Earlier, the two leaders signed the joint statement before standing to shake hands. At Moon\u2019s instigation, they joined hands and raised their arms aloft, ending the exchange with an embrace and more of the broad smiles that were a feature of their joint public appearances throughout the day. International reaction to the summit was largely positive. China, the North\u2019s main ally and its biggest economic partner, described the leaders\u2019 handshake as a historic moment. \u201cWe applaud the Korean leaders\u2019 historic step and appreciate their political decisions and courage,\u201d Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, told reporters. \u201cWe hope and look forward to them taking this opportunity to further open a new journey of long-term stability on the peninsula.\u201d The White House said in a statement that it was \u201chopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean peninsula \u2026 [and] looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks\u201d. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, sounded a more cautious note. While \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the summit, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody looking at the history of North Korea\u2019s plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point. But it is clearly good news that the two leaders are meeting. Absolutely.\u201d Virginie Grzelczyk, a senior lecturer at Aston University, said: \u201cThis is a very long game, and confidence-building will take a lot of time. I am not sure a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump would add anything to this particularly good development in inter-Korean relations today, and it might be that this would blur the line.\u201d",
