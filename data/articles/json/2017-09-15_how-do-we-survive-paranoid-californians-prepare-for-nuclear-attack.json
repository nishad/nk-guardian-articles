    "content": "Hal Kempfer, a noted international security expert, is getting a roomful of California public health officials and emergency responders to think about the unthinkable \u2013 a nuclear bomb exploding at the port of Long Beach, about four miles away. His message \u2013 coming on the same day North Korea threatened to reduce the mainland United States to \u201cashes and darkness\u201d and then launched a ballistic missile over Japan \u2013 is unvarnished and uncompromising: get ready, because we all need to prepare for what comes after. \u201cA lot of people will be killed,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a large percentage of the population will survive. They will be at risk and they will need help.\u201d Most likely, Kempfer tells his audience, if the device is fired from North Korea or smuggled in by North Korean agents, it wouldn\u2019t be the sort of high-yield weapon that planners worried about during the cold war, with the potential to wipe out most life and civilization across the Los Angeles region and send radioactive materials halfway across the American continent. Rather, it\u2019s likely to be a Hiroshima-sized bomb \u2013 large enough to obliterate everything within a square-mile radius and kill tens of thousands of people, either immediately or through the lingering effects of radiation. But still leaving millions of survivors across the region who would need help. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about smaller North Korean things,\u201d Kempfer emphasized, though the word \u201csmaller\u201d sounds very far from reassuring. \u201cThis is not your traditional nuclear apocalypse scenario.\u201d Kempfer, a retired marines lieutenant colonel, is a charismatic speaker, with a keen understanding of the need for humor to leaven the grimness of the subject matter. And so he talked through what would and would not be left standing after an attack on the port \u2013 which, together with its neighbor in San Pedro, is by far the busiest maritime trading hub in the United States and a key component of the global trading system. He talks about the port and downtown Long Beach being \u201ctoast\u201d \u2013 no exaggeration, since the blast wave is likely to vaporize everything in its immediate path. But the city health department, the Long Beach airport and fire department might not be; they are all somewhat protected by a hilly area that is likely to halt the initial blast wave. And so the city can, tentatively, think about setting up a center of emergency operations. Of course, the radioactive fallout created as the explosion gathers up tremendous quantities of dust and ocean water and spits them into the atmosphere would represent a secondary grave risk, especially in the first hours after an attack. Not to mention the electromagnetic pulse that is likely to knock out electronic systems including phones and computers, the pile-ups expected on the freeways as drivers are blinded by the flash of the explosion, the rush for food, water and gasoline as millions of Angelenos attempt to drive out of the region, and the terror triggered by even the idea of a second, follow-up attack. Kempfer and his colleague, fellow marine veteran Matt Begert, sugarcoat little or none of this. They talk about North Korea\u2019s advances in testing intercontinental ballistic missiles \u2013 the reason Long Beach\u2019s head of public health emergency management invited them in the first place \u2013 about the likelihood that Long Beach is high on North Korea\u2019s target list, and about the likely movements of a deadly radiation plume according to wind, terrain, and urban landscape. \u201cHow do we survive?\u201d a public health worker asks despairingly from the middle of the room in the heat of the presentation. \u201cIf you\u2019re not blown up,\u201d Kempfer retorts, without missing a beat, \u201cthat helps.\u201d He and Begert then talk through a risk assessment matrix, based on history (more applicable to natural disasters), vulnerability, how bad an event could potentially be, and the probability of it occurring. It\u2019s a method Kempfer uses to get local communities to focus on what matters most, not what happens to have been in the news that day or that month. In Long Beach\u2019s case, preparing for an earthquake is still a higher priority, but the nuclear threat is not too far behind. \u201cIf you want to mess up southern California, if you want to mess up the west coast, if you want to mess up our country \u2013 where do you attack?\u201d Kempfer asks. \u201cIf I\u2019m sitting in North Korea and looking at possible targets, I\u2019m going to be looking at Long Beach very closely.\u201d Kempfer and his group, Knowledge and Intelligence Program Professionals, are not the first to think through the consequences of a nuclear attack on Long Beach. In 2006, when the worry was more al-Qaida than North Korea, the Rand corporation published a report assessing the impact of a 10-kiloton bomb smuggled into the port in a shipping container. Rand\u2019s scenario envisaged a significant breakdown in social order, including gunfights over food and gasoline and shootouts on the freeway as desperate families stuck in traffic look for any possible way to hasten their route over the mountains. Rand also imagined the health system collapsing as hospitals and health workers became overwhelmed with hundreds of thousands of people needing decontamination and other treatment. Kempfer thought a well-coordinated response from the federal government \u2013 analogous to the improved performance in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, compared with the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 \u2013 could play a crucial role in holding together the social fabric and making sure crucial supplies did not run so low as to start rioting. Still, neighboring counties \u2013 particularly Ventura County, to the north-west of Los Angeles \u2013 are themselves deeply concerned about being overwhelmed by millions of evacuees. Ventura, unusually, has prepared a 250-page plan in the event of nuclear attack, which it updates regularly, along with a public information campaign featuring an oddly jaunty musical entreaty to residents to stay indoors until the worst of the radioactive fallout has subsided. News out of North Korea has created a mini-bonanza for local manufacturers of nuclear fallout shelters. But more important to the vast bulk of the population, Kempfer says, is having some rudimentary knowledge of what it means to \u201cshelter in place\u201d and, for example, to have plastic sheeting on hand to cover up windows and cracks in the doors to minimize the effects of radioactive fallout. Sandy Wedgeworth, the public health emergency management coordinator, said she and her staff felt energized, not depressed, by what they learned from Kempfer and that the session generated a long to-do list. \u201cWe need to look at our county plan and become familiar with it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we also need to think about mutual aid systems and getting resources from elsewhere. Obviously, we don\u2019t have everything we need. The point is knowing where to get more stuff.\u201d She and her colleagues appeared to concur with Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s old adage, quoted approvingly by Kempfer, that while plans in warfare can be useless, planning is indispensable. \u201cThe more education I get,\u201d Wedgeworth said, \u201cthe more I understand and the more competent I feel to respond. It\u2019s less scary when you understand the threat and know what to do to meet and mitigate it.\u201d",
