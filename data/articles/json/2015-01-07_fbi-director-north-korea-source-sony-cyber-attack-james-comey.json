    "content": "The FBI director, James Comey, has stood by the bureau\u2019s conclusion that the North Korean government was responsible for the mammoth computer hack on Sony pictures, saying the hackers \u201cgot sloppy\u201d and allowed their location to be identified on a number of occasions. Speaking at Fordham University\u2019s international conference on cyber security on Wednesday, Comey said: \u201cI have every confidence about this attribution, as does the entire intelligence community.\u201d Questions over the origins of the hack \u2013 carried out by a group calling itself Guardians of Peace (GOP) and demanding that Sony\u2019s controversial North Korean comedy The Interview be pulled from release \u2013 have mounted since the FBI named North Korea responsible in December. A private cybersecurity firm investigating the hack cast doubt on the FBI\u2019s findings and indicated last month those responsible could have been former Sony employees, while other studies have pointed the finger at Russian hackers. But Comey used the conference to shed further light on the FBI investigation\u2019s findings, saying that studies of GOP emails to Sony employees revealed the use of IP addresses in North Korea. The group had failed to use hacked third-party proxy servers \u201cseveral times\u201d, Comey said, allowing the FBI to track their locations. \u201cIn nearly every case, [GOP] used proxy servers to disguise where they were coming from in sending these emails and posting these statements. But several times they got sloppy,\u201d Comey said. \u201cSeveral times, either because they forgot or because of a technical problem, they connected directly and we could see that the IPs they were using \u2026 were exclusively used by the North Koreans.\u201d In December the FBI stated that an analysis of the malware used in the attack had shown coding and encryption similarities to previous malignant software used in known North Korean attacks, but added that the need to \u201cprotect sensitive sources and methods\u201d prevented them from giving further detail. Comey added he had been pushing for further details of the investigation to be declassified. The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, also addressed the conference, describing the attack \u201cthe most serious cyber-attack ever made against US interests\u201d. Clapper gave details of a visit he made to North Korea in November as a presidential envoy to secure the release of two American citizens, Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller, held by the regime and later released. \u201cThey [North Korean government officials] are deadly, deadly serious, no pun intended, about affronts to the supreme leader, whom they consider to be a deity,\u201d Clapper told the conference. \u201cI watched The Interview over the weekend and it\u2019s obvious to me that North Koreans don\u2019t have a sense of humour.\u201d Sony pictures has been left reeling from the November attack after thousands of documents were published online including personal email correspondence, employees\u2019 personal data, executive pay and unreleased films and scripts. The Interview, which stars James Franco and Seth Rogen, was initially pulled from theatrical release but subsequently made available online and has become Sony\u2019s highest-grossing digital release.",
