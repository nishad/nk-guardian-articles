    "content": "After deciding to cancel the release of The Interview following terrorist threats from hackers believed to be working with North Korea, Sony Pictures is under fire from cinema chains and political lobbyists in the US, as it considers its options for a potential online version. Cinema owners are angry at a perceived scapegoating by the studio over the decision to pull the film from theatrical release. Sony has claimed that chains backing out was the reason they cancelled the Christmas screenings. Yet exhibitors now say many only wanted delays or modifications to the timetable of release in the wake of a message from Guardians of Peace hinting at 9/11-style attacks on cinemas showing the film. This threat caused concern among cinema chains, whose shares began to fall, and other studios, whose own holiday releases might be affected by audiences staying away from cinemas. Yet according to Variety, three industry executives have said that they dispute Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton\u2019s characterisation that they were left with \u201cno choice\u201d but to pull release after \u201ctheatre owners declined to show it\u201d. Rather, they say, most major chains wanted to wait until the identity of the hackers \u2013 and therefore the seriousness of their threat \u2013 could be gauged. Lynton was speaking on Friday, following Obama\u2019s statement that Sony had made a \u201cmistake\u201d pulling the film as it played into the hands of the hackers, whose identity he said the FBI had confirmed as North Korean. The Republican National Committee has also encouraged cinema owners to reverse any decision not to show the film. In a letter obtained by CNN, RNC chairman Reince Priebus encouraged the CEOs of 10 major cinema chains to reconsider. \u201cI want to speak clearly on behalf of the Republican Party: I urge you to show the movie,\u201d he wrote to the CEOs. \u201cAs a sign of my commitment, if you agree to show this movie, I will send a note to the Republican Party\u2019s millions of donors and supporters urging them to buy a ticket \u2013 not to support one movie or Hollywood, but to show North Korea we cannot be bullied into giving up our freedom.\u201d Sony is considering using YouTube to distribute the film, with Lynton saying it was \u201ccertainly an option and certainly one thing we will consider.\u201d He said that none of the major VOD services (like Netflix) had stepped forward to offer to host the film, nor would it use its own on-demand service Crackle. A lawyer for Sony, David Boies, told NBC: \u201cSony has been fighting to get this picture distributed. It will be distributed. How it\u2019s going to be distributed, I don\u2019t think anybody knows quite yet. But it\u2019s going to be distributed.\u201d Meanwhile, Dr Evil, Mike Myers\u2019s Austin Powers Bond-spoofing baddie, appeared on Saturday Night Live to berate both Sony and North Korea for giving \u201cevil organisations a bad name\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s start with you, North Korea,\u201d said Myers, \u201cYou\u2019re one of the most evil countries in the world and your act of war is to kill a movie? It\u2019s easy to kill a movie. Just move it to January.\u201d Myers also attacked Guardians of Peace for their non-evil name, and Sony, who \u201chaven\u2019t had a hit since the Walkman.\u201d \u201cYou thought it was a joke to have James Franco assassinate Kim Jong-un? The man single-handedly almost killed the Oscars.\u201d The North Korean government has meanwhile claimed that the US government was behind production of The Interview, the comedy film which lampoons its leader, Kim Jong-un. In a statement on Sunday carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, the National Defence Commission \u2013 the country\u2019s military body \u2013 declared that it had \u201cclear evidence that the US administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie\u201d. On Friday, President Obama said that the US would \u201crespond proportionately\u201d to the cyber attack on Sony Pictures, following the FBI\u2019s confirmation that the North Korean government had ordered the attack, angered by the film. North Korea has now threatened to attack \u201cthe White House, the Pentagon and the whole US mainland, the cesspool of terrorism\u201d should such action occur. Sony hacks: the timeline so far",
