    "content": "Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have stepped up their rhetoric over North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme, a day after Pyongyang drew international condemnation when it launched a mid-range missile over Japan. The US president, who on Tuesday said \u201call options are on the table\u201d to contain North Korea, tweeted on Wednesday that \u201ctalking is not the answer\u201d and said the US had been paying \u201cextortion money\u201d to the regime. The North Korean leader earlier described Tuesday\u2019s missile launch as a \u201cmeaningful prelude to containing\u201d the US Pacific territory of Guam, adding that more ballistic missile tests were to come. Hours after North Korea confirmed the test, the UN security council unanimously condemned the launch and repeated demands that Pyongyang halt its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes. The 15-member council described North Korea\u2019s actions as \u201coutrageous\u201d and called for the full implementation of tough sanctions agreed less than a month ago. But it did not recommend fresh measures against the regime, and said it remained committed to a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula. \u201cThe security council stresses that these DPRK actions are not just a threat to the region, but to all UN member states,\u201d it said, referring to the north by its official title, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The statement went on to express \u201cgrave concern that the DPRK is, by conducting such a launch over Japan as well as its recent actions and public statements, deliberately undermining regional peace and stability\u201d. The emergency meeting was called after the North Korean intermediate-range missile designed to carry a nuclear payload flew over northern Japan on Tuesday morning. The missile is believed to have been a relatively untested Hwasong-12, the same type Kim has recently threatened to use against Guam, a key US military base located about 1,800 miles (3,000km) south-east of North Korea. North Korea\u2019s KCNA state news agency said Kim had \u201cpersonally guided\u201d the missile, which came in response to military drills involving tens of thousands of troops from South Korea and the US. Pyongyang regards the annual Ulchi-Freedom Guardian exercises, which end on Thursday, as a dress rehearsal for an invasion and often responds with a display of its own increasing military might. \u201cThe current ballistic rocket launching drill like a real war is the first step of the military operation of the Korean People\u2019s army in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam,\u201d KCNA quoted Kim as saying. The launch on Tuesday triggered sirens in towns across northern Japan, sending some residents underground but leaving many unsure of how to protect themselves. North Korea had twice before sent rockets over Japan, in 1998 and 2009, but the regime claimed those were carrying communications satellites. On Wednesday, Pyongyang was explicit in referring to the launch as involving a missile, which South Korean experts said travelled 2,700km before landing in the Pacific, east of the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. \u201cThe drill had no impact on the security of neighbouring countries,\u201d KCNA insisted, adding that Kim expressed \u201cgreat satisfaction\u201d over the launch. The agency quoted Kim as saying that there would be \u201cmore ballistic rocket launches\u201d in the Pacific, adding that the regime would monitor Washington\u2019s response before deciding on its future actions. Some analysts have suggested that Pyongyang could have sent the missile over Japan having concluded that targeting areas closer to Guam would cross a \u201cred line\u201d and invite a more robust response from the White House. The launch had historical as well as diplomatic significance, coming on the 107th anniversary of the Japan-Korea treaty of 1910, which marked the start of 35 years of Japanese colonial rule of the Korean peninsula. In ordering the launch on Tuesday, Kim had communicated the anger many Koreans still felt towards Japan, with his \u201cbold plan to make the cruel Japanese islanders insensible on bloody 29 August\u201d. The north\u2019s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the test should remind Washington that \u201cit can neither browbeat [North Korea] with any economic sanctions or military threats and blackmail, nor make [it] flinch from the road it has chosen for itself\u201d. Weeks after he threatened to counter North Korean provocations with \u201cfire and fury\u201d, Trump had initially offered a more measured response to Tuesday\u2019s missile launch. \u201cThreatening and destabilising actions only increase the North Korean regime\u2019s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAll options are on the table.\u201d The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley warned that \u201cenough is enough\u201d and that tough action had to be taken in response to North Korea\u2019s most recent provocation. The US has reportedly proposed that the UN security council adopt a statement condemning the ballistic launch and demanding that \u201call states ... strictly, fully, and expeditiously implement\u201d UN sanctions against the regime. The draft statement, however, does not include fresh punitive measures. Seven previous rounds of UN sanctions did little to slow North Korea\u2019s nuclear and weapons programmes.",
