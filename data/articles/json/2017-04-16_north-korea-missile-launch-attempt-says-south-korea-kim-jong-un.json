    "content": "North Korea has defied Donald Trump\u2019s demands for it to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes, launching a missile from an eastern port city on Sunday morning. However, the test appeared to fail. \u201cThe missile blew up almost immediately,\u201d the United States Pacific Command said in a statement. \u201cThe type of missile is still being assessed.\u201d Reuters reported one US official as saying it was confident the failed projectile was not an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The attempt came hours before US vice-president Mike Pence was due to arrive in Seoul at the start of a 10-day trip to Asia in what his aides said was a sign of the US commitment to its ally in the face of rising tension over North Korea. Both Pence and President Donald Trump have been notified. The president had no further comment, said defence secretary Jim Mattis. South Korea described the launch as a \u201cthreat to the entire world\u201d and warned that it would respond to any further provocations, such as a nuclear test or the launch of an ICBM. \u201cNorth Korea showing a variety of offensive missiles at yesterday\u2019s military parade and daring to fire a ballistic missile today is a show of force that threatens the whole world,\u201d South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. The missile was launched from the eastern coastal city of Sinpo, which is the site of a submarine base and where the North has tested the submarine-launched ballistic missile it is developing. Weapons on submarines are much harder to track and destroy, and would make it far more challenging for the US and its allies to mount a pre-emptive strike. However, it is thought the latest launch was land-based. A spokesman for the UK Foreign Office said: \u201cWe are concerned by reports of a missile test by North Korea and are monitoring the situation closely.\u201d The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urged North Korea to abide by UN resolutions and end its quest to develop nuclear weapons. \u201cWe have been here before but continue to monitor the situation carefully,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cWe stand alongside our international partners in making clear that North Korea must adhere to UN resolutions designed to secure peace and stability in the region and stop its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\u201d Sunday\u2019s missile launch comes a day after a giant military parade in North Korea\u2019s capital and exactly one year after a similar failure, when Pyongyang attempted to mark the anniversary of its founder\u2019s birth, Kim Il-sung, on 15 April, by launching a Musudan missile. North Korea displayed new long-range missiles that could one day threaten continental America, showcasing the isolated nation\u2019s defiance as a US aircraft carrier group headed to the region. On Sunday, the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers\u2019 party, issued a special edition to mark the previous day\u2019s celebrations, and devoted several pages \u2013 including dozens of photos \u2013 to what appeared to be new types of strategic weapons, including an ICBM. Kim Jong-un has overseen three nuclear tests and a string of missile and rocket launches since taking over after the death of his father, dictator Kim Jong-il, in late 2011. Another missile test from Sinpo ended in failured earlier this month, when the rocket spun out of control and plunged into the ocean. That launch came shortly before Trump\u2019s first meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. China is North Korea\u2019s only major ally. Despite Sunday\u2019s failure, the North\u2019s previous claim to have used \u201cstandardised\u201d warheads has led to worries that it was making headway in its push to develop small and sophisticated warheads to be topped on long-range missiles. John Delury, a North Korea expert from Yonsei University in Seoul, said the fact that the test had \u201cfizzled\u201d would be a frustration rather than a major embarrassment to Kim Jong-un. \u201cFailure is part of the game \u2026 They\u2019ve shown they\u2019re not afraid to test and anyone who follows this knows that the testing will continue.\u201d Delury said the message to Trump from Sunday\u2019s launch was: \u201cWe\u2019re not stopping our testing program because you are threatening us\u201d. \u201cThat may be enough of a strong signal from their perspective for the immediate future,\u201d he added. \u201cOne hopes that everyone can now step back from the cliff and keep face.\u201d China offered no immediate reaction to the missile launch. But in a commentary released after Saturday\u2019s military demonstration, Beijing\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, said the region had reached \u201ca critical moment in history\u201d and warned that a pre-emptive US strike could trigger full-scale war. It was now time for North Korea and the US to strike a \u201cgrand bargain,\u201d Xinhua said.",
