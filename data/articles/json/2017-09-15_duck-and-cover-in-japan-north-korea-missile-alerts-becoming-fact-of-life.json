    "content": "For the second time in just over a fortnight, millions of people in northern Japan were jolted awake by an alert warning them a North Korean missile was heading in their direction. \u201cMissile launch! Missile launch!\u201d read the first of two messages, as the wail of sirens pierced the early-morning calm in a dozen prefectures, including the northern island of Hokkaido. \u201cA missile appears to have been launched from North Korea. Take cover in a building or underground,\u201d the message added. The missile, thought to be an intermediate-range Hwasong-12, was of the same type that triggered Japan\u2019s first J-alert warning at the end of last month \u2013 a chilling reminder to North Korea\u2019s neighbour that it is within easy striking distance of its missiles. As the US and countries in the region persists with sanctions and continue to rule out dialogue \u2013 a hardline stance mirrored by Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime \u2013 residents were concerned that ballistic fly-pasts and calls to \u201cduck and cover\u201d could become an uncomfortable fact of life. Seven minutes later, a second text confirmed the missile had passed over Japanese territory without incident before splashing into the Pacific ocean 2,000km to the east. \u201cMissile passed. Missile passed,\u201d it said. \u201cIt seems that the missile has passed Hokkaido area and landed in the Pacific Ocean. If you find anything suspicious, please don\u2019t go close to it. Report it to the police and firefighters.\u201d Friday\u2019s missile was the fourth to have passed over Japanese territory. The first was in 1998 and the second in 2009, although Pyongyang claims they were rockets carrying satellites into orbit. Multiple missile tests in recent months have sparked concern \u2013 although not panic \u2013 in Japan and ushered in a flurry of civil defence activity not witnessed since the end of the war. About a dozen towns have conducted evacuation drills since North Korean missiles landed in the sea inside Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone in March, and sales of nuclear shelters have soared, although the overall number is still low. \u201cI cannot say that we are used to this. I mean, the missile flew right above our town. It\u2019s not a very comforting thing to hear,\u201d said Yoshihiro Saito, who works in the small Hokkaido fishing town of Erimo. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty scary.\u201d Like the 29 August launch, text alerts implored residents to seek shelter underground or in sturdy buildings. North Korea\u2019s proximity means that Japanese authorities realistically have less than 10 minutes to confirm a missile launch and issue the alerts. After receiving his second warning in a little over two weeks, Yoichi Takahashi questioned the government\u2019s advice. \u201cIt\u2019s really scary. The government tells us to flee to stable buildings but we can\u2019t do that quickly,\u201d said the 57-year old fisheries official in the Hokkaido town of Kushiro. \u201cOur colleagues offshore can never take cover. It has now happened twice to us ... we\u2019re going to have restless days from now on.\u201d Japan\u2019s response to the missile launches has prompted criticism that the government is exploiting public anxiety as it seeks to expand its missile defence systems and, perhaps, consider giving its self-defence forces the capability to carry out pre-emptive strikes against North Korean targets. Its conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, routinely describes the launches as a \u201cgrave\u201d threat to Japan, assuring the country\u2019s citizens their government is doing all it can to guarantee their safety. On Friday, as at the end of last month, there were no reports of damage to aircraft or shipping in the area, or of missile debris falling onto land from a height of well over 500km. North Korea\u2019s displays of nuclear brinkmanship have become a regular interruption in Japanese daytime TV schedules in recent weeks. On Friday, the national broadcaster NHK cut away from regular programming to cover the aftermath of its launch. Commuters making their way to work in Sapporo, the biggest city on Hokkaido, were handed special newspaper editions announcing the test. Bullet trains operating in the region, as well as some subway services, were suspended. Matthew Galat, a US citizens staying near Lake Toya in Hokkaido, said he had been woken up by \u201ca really loud noise on my phone\u201d. \u201cThis loud speaker is playing all throughout the city,\u201d Galat said in a Facebook video recorded while the sirens were still sounding. The vlogger, who is cycling around the world, said the alert, which he translated into English on his smartphone, told him to find shelter in a basement because North Korea had just launched a missile. \u201cCrazy \u2026 stupid,\u201d he said. The alert also disrupted play at an international golf tournament in Sapporo. Matt Griffin, an Australian golfer, said he was in his hotel room when he received the text alerts. \u201cIt was a bit of a shock, and I thought \u2018Not again\u2019,\u201d Griffin told the Guardian. Players who had already teed off at Sapporo golf club were instructed to leave the course and stay in the clubhouse. Play resumed after 40 minutes, said Griffin, who was due to start his second round in the ANA Open on Friday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s been a topic of conversation among the players in my group,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone hopes that this is just for show and then the North Koreans will come to their senses. If it\u2019s a one-off then you tend not to be too concerned, but if it keeps happening, that\u2019s when you start to worry.\u201d While the immediate threat has passed, Hokkaido residents worried that the launches could have a knock-on effect on visitor numbers and other local industries. Hironori Matsura, an official in Erimo, said: \u201cWe are afraid that this may have an impact on our life, ranging from fishing to tourism.\u201d As life began to return to normal, for a while there was only one topic of conversation in the town. The predictable focus, according to Saito: \u201cHow scary it is.\u201d Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.",
