    "content": "The former NBA star Dennis Rodman \u2013 the only prominent American who has met Kim Jong-un \u2013 has said he knew the doors between North Korea and the United States would open one day. \u201cMuch respect to President Trump and Marshall Kim Jong-un for their upcoming historic meeting,\u201d Rodman wrote on Twitter. \u201cI said it back in 2014 that doors will open. \u001dPeace \u001dlove \u001dnot war.\u201d The comment came after late Thursday\u2019s stunning announcement that Donald Trump would meet Kim soon in a landmark summit aimed at ratcheting down threats of nuclear destruction from both sides. Rodman, a 1990s star of the Chicago Bulls, where he won three NBA championships, has visited North Korea several times \u2013 in 2013, 2014 and again last year \u2013 and cultivated an unlikely friendship with Kim, an avowed NBA fan. In the early meetings he urged North Korea to free Americans being held prisoner in the country, and put on basketball demonstrations for Kim. In last year\u2019s visit Rodman delivered to Kim a copy of Trump\u2019s book The Art of the Deal. With AFP",
