    "content": "Donald Trump has indicated that he would be prepared to meet the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at some point, though he said it was still \u201cfar too early\u201d for a one-to-one conversation with his adversary. Speaking at the outset of a five-nation Asia tour set to be dominated by the standoff over North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme, Trump declared himself happy to \u201csit down with anybody\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s strength or weakness, I think sitting down with people is not a bad thing,\u201d he told the journalist Sharyl Attkisson, host of the Full Measure TV show \u201cSo I would certainly be open to doing that [sitting down with Kim] but we\u2019ll see where it goes. I think we\u2019re far too early.\u201d The rare conciliatory tone contrasted with more familiar Trump bluster earlier in the weekend, when he told US troops in Japan that \u201cno dictator\u201d should underestimate America, in a thinly veiled reference to Kim. \u201cNo one, no dictator, no regime \u2026 should underestimate American resolve,\u201d Trump told cheering servicemen and women after he landed at Yokota airbase near Tokyo on Sunday on the first leg of his trip. \u201cYou are the greatest threat to tyrants and dictators who seek to prey on the innocent,\u201d he said, adding that authoritarian regimes could also take the route \u201ctowards prosperity and peace\u201d. \u201cNo nation should ever underestimate American resolve,\u201d said Trump, who did not refer to North Korea by name. \u201cEvery once a while in the past they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it? We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defence of our people, our freedom and our great American flag.\u201d North Korea marked Trump\u2019s arrival in Japan by warning the \u201cspiritually unstable\u201d president not to make \u201creckless remarks\u201d about the regime in Pyongyang. The Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers\u2019 party, claimed that US voters were pushing for Trump\u2019s impeachment out of fear he would bring \u201cnuclear disaster\u201d to the US mainland. Under Trump and Kim, Washington and Pyongyang have come closer to blows than at any time since the Korean armistice of 1953. North Korean rocket technology is now a direct threat to the US mainland and Trump has stepped up the rhetoric with no sign of following through on threats. Earlier in the weekend, the Pentagon indicated that the only way to destroy North Korea\u2019s programme would be through a ground invasion.",
