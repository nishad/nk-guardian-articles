    "content": "North Korea\u2019s denunciation of John Bolton has forced Donald Trump to decide whether to stick with his national security adviser and his hardline tactics, or push ahead with a summit with Kim Jong-un that will provide historic spectacle but an uncertain outcome. Underlying the plans for the Singapore summit was a fundamental ambiguity over what \u201ccomplete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d means. For Pyongyang it is a fluid term that means a long-term process of disarmament, involving all major powers, in whose ranks North Korea would henceforward be counted a member. The Trump administration thought it meant \u2013 or wanted it to mean \u2013 that Kim was ready to give up the arsenal he had declared complete and operational in January. For his part, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who was tasked by Trump to set up the Kim summit, was ready to live with the ambiguity, at least until 12 June, when the unprecedented encounter is due to take place. In weekend television appearances, Pompeo seemed to blur the US negotiating position, suggesting the aim was to prevent North Korea threatening the US mainland with nuclear weapons, a lower bar that would theoretically permit Pyongyang to retain some warheads as long as they did not build intercontinental missiles. Ambiguity is not Bolton\u2019s style, however. In his own, competing, TV appearances, he was adamant that North Korea would have to take all its weapons apart and ship the fissile material to the US. It was this, coupled his earlier reference to the \u201cLibya model\u201d \u2013 which for Pyongyang summons up the memory of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s brutalised body being paraded on a truck \u2013 that got the regime\u2019s attention. \u201cIt was quite deliberate. We all know how Gaddafi died,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia nonproliferation programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies of Monterey. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring up a man\u2019s grisly murder as an inducement.\u201d Vipin Narang, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it was likely to be the bragging that Kim had been forced to the table by Trump\u2019s successful use of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d with sanctions and threats that had stung the Pyongyang regime most. Kim has portrayed his diplomatic opening as a natural consequence of completing the decades-long project to build a nuclear arsenal. \u201cThe North Koreans were prepared to ignore a lot of what the administration said before the summit, but it was the victory lap before the race that has really set them off,\u201d Narang said. Bolton has a track record with the North Koreans, who blame him for persuading the George W Bush administration to quit a 1994 nuclear deal, the Agreed Framework. In his memoir, Surrender is Not an Option, Bolton boasts about his success in torpedoing state department efforts to keep talks with Pyongyang alive, deriding the diplomats as appeasers. At the time, the regime denounced him as \u201chuman scum\u201d and a \u201cbloodsucker\u201d, banning him from any bilateral talks. On Wednesday, the first deputy prime minister, Kim Kye-gwan, made it clear that the regime\u2019s antipathy had not mellowed with time, noting \u201cwe do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him\u201d. Earlier in the week, a western diplomat had predicted that the inevitable compromise at a Kim summit could force a parting of the ways between Trump and his third national security adviser. Trump, who has basked in suggestions he might be eligible for the Nobel peace prize, is clearly keen to keep his appointment in Singapore. The weekend row could now bring his looming dilemma forward. The White House on Wednesday was hedging its bets, with its spokeswoman pointedly distancing Trump from Bolton\u2019s \u201cLibyan model\u201d. \u201cSarah Sanders threw Bolton under a bus this morning,\u201d Lewis said.",
