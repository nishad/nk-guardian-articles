    "content": "The Liberal backbencher and former army commander Andrew Nikolic has warned that Iran presents a potentially worse threat than Islamic State (Isis), one that may require an urgent military response. On the day that Tony Abbott threatened to \u201cshirtfront\u201d Vladimir Putin, Nikolic described Iran, Russia and North Korea as the \u201cmaverick trifecta\u201d of \u201cproblem states\u201d. \u201cAdmittedly, Isil casts a long and fearful shadow, but there are potentially worse \u2013 albeit quieter \u2013 threats lurking, which also demand urgent attention,\u201d Nikolic wrote for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. \u201cThey include the maverick trifecta of Iran, Russia and North Korea. Unlike Isil, each of those international \u2018problem-states\u2019 comes disproportionately better armed, including a ready-made or emerging nuclear capability, accompanied by an unpredictable senior leadership.\u201d As Australia joined the international coalition to fight Isis, \u201cthe time for action on Iran is now much closer than it has ever been\u201d. Isis follows a virulent form of Sunni Islam which has targeted Shi\u2019ism, which is the majority sect in Iraq and Iran. Nikolic suggested \u201cboth Isil and Iran must be confronted and resolved closer together\u201d, with the US \u201cby default\u201d leading the way, pushing for international consensus on an effective strategy to contain Iran. \u201cAlmost certainly, such a strategy will include multiple and complementary lines of engagement across the international community and with Iran itself,\u201d Nikolic wrote. \u201cThose will embrace the broad sweep from diplomacy, to international consensus and coalition building, to economic sanctions, and in extremis, the possibility of military action.\u201d Nikolic is highly regarded in the Coalition for his long experience in defence, including appointments in the Middle East. He served in the defence force for 31 years, including as the first Australian national commander in southern Iraq, a chief of staff and deputy commander during Australia\u2019s initial involvement in Afghanistan and as a United Nations team leader in Israel, Syria and Lebanon. He was first assistant secretary in the defence department, advising government on international defence relations and operations. Nikolic is also a member of the powerful parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, which is reviewing the government\u2019s second tranche of national security laws. Nikolic wrote that the focus on \u201cungoverned spaces\u201d in Iraq and Syria was distracting from broader strategic priorities, putting Iran on the \u201cbackburner\u201d. \u201cThe first unresolved problem confronting the world is what exactly to do about Iran,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe threat of a nuclear-armed Iran would dwarf that which is posed by Isil, whose mayhem and carnage Australia now works to suppress. For almost a decade, since September 2006, Iran has steadfastly and with contempt thumbed its nose at the international community, by remaining deliberately in breach of its nuclear arms control obligations.\u201d Nikolic argues Iran has taken the stance for three reasons: for prestige and power, for its opposition to the \u201cdisproportionate power\u201d of the US and Israel, and because international inaction on Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program would be interpreted by Tehran as weak. \u201cThe issues of Isil and Iran overlap in at least two ways,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe international community\u2019s focus on the former gives Iran more time and enhanced cover to develop its thinly veiled nuclear capability. \u201cAnd depending on how current- to mid-term events unfold in the Middle East, Tehran might see a pretext, or reason, to initiate military action against Isil in its own right, at least to further extend or expand proxy-military actions against the west.\u201d \u201cThe wider world was finally roused to the true menace of Isil by its evil mix of malevolent atrocity exported by social media,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut replace the ghastly spectre of Isil\u2019s severed heads and slain thousands, with an Iranian nuclear device used somewhere in the Middle East \u2013 and the mind is concentrated wonderfully, about the broader potential for a worse crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s time the international community took Iran off the backburner.\u201d",
