    "content": "The vice-president, Mike Pence, will stop North Korea \u201chijacking\u201d the Winter Olympics, an aide said on Sunday, by using his own presence at the Games to remind the world \u201ceverything the North Koreans do at the Olympics is a charade to cover up the fact that they are the most tyrannical and oppressive regime on the planet\u201d. Such rhetoric contrasts with recent diplomatic exchanges between North and South Korea. The two countries will march under one flag at the Games, which begin in Pyeongchang on Friday. They will also field a joint women\u2019s ice hockey team. Diplomacy around the Games has been hailed as a success, at odds with confrontational and inflammatory rhetoric from the White House and Pyongyang since Donald Trump became president last year. Kim Jong-un\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear weapon deliverable to US soil has fuelled tension, as have Trump\u2019s aggressive speeches and tweets on the subject. Last month, a false alarm of an incoming ballistic missile spread panic in Hawaii. Trump, who has repeatedly threatened military action, criticised North Korea in his State of the Union speech to Congress this week, at which a North Korean defector was a praised guest. A spokesperson for North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said on Sunday the speech reflected \u201cthe height of Trump-style arrogance, arbitrariness and self-conceit\u201d. Pence is due to attend the Olympics opening ceremony and some early events, as part of an Asia tour. The Axios website quoted the unidentified aide to the vice-president as saying: \u201cAt every opportunity, the VP will point out the reality of the oppression in North Korea by a regime that has enslaved its people. We will not allow North Korea\u2019s propaganda to hijack the messaging of the Olympics. \u201cWe are seeing unprecedented level of international cooperation on the maximum pressure strategy targeting the Kim [Jong-un] regime, and the vice-president will make clear that this maximum pressure campaign will only intensify.\u201d Axios quoted another unidentified government source as saying: \u201cNorth Korea wants to make this about cute photo ops. The vice-president is countering North Korea\u2019s desire to control the message. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to cede two weeks of world media to North Korea.\u201d In January, Trump spoke approvingly of the Olympic rapprochement, for which he appeared to take credit. He said: \u201cA lot of people have said and a lot of people have written that without my rhetoric and without my tough stance \u2013 and it\u2019s not just a stance, I mean this is what has to be done \u2013 that they wouldn\u2019t be talking about Olympics, they wouldn\u2019t be talking right now.\u201d",
