    "content": "The crisis in relations between the US and North Korea has put Donald Trump\u2019s symbiotic relationship with his favorite morning TV show, Fox &amp; Friends, firmly back in the spotlight. As rhetoric over nuclear war suddenly ramped up between the US president and North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un, on Tuesday night and the US media began intense coverage stretching into Wednesday, Trump and the Fox News show set about amplifying each other to a worldwide audience. Between around 3am and 6am ET on Wednesday, Trump, who is on what appears to be a \u201cworking vacation\u201d at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, retweeted Fox and Friends social media posts five times. Two of those retweets were of Fox\u2019s tweets of the president\u2019s own remarks on the North Korean diplomatic nuclear crunch point, as Trump chose to re-echo an echo from a friendly TV station of his own utterances. One was a retweet of a post that included a video of Trump promising \u201cfire and fury\u201d in response to Kim\u2019s missile provocations; one was a retweet of Fox\u2019s reporting more of the president\u2019s statement. The third retweet emanating from the president\u2019s favored Twitter handle, @realDonaldTrump, gave a boost to Fox &amp; Friends tweeting a story about US military readiness in the face of threats to the US territory Guam, in the region of the Korean peninsula, headlined \u201cUS Air Force jets take off from Guam for training, ensuring they can \u2018fight tonight\u2019.\u201d Trump waited to make any fresh points on the crisis with North Korea until several hours later. Trump has previously pointed out that he watches the Fox &amp; Friends morning TV show, and its content often appears to influence his daily agenda and public comments, just as the show in turn tends to turn a warm glow on the president\u2019s actions and policies. The seemingly symbiotic relationship between the show and the president has prompted journalists for less Republican-leaning channels, such as CNN and ABC, to refer to Fox as \u201cState TV\u201d. Steve Herman, White House correspondent for Voice of America, suggested that Trump\u2019s global promotion of Fox\u2019s journalism could reinforce long-held assumptions in North Korea that the US government tells the media what to say. \u201cBased on my previous discussions with #DPRK [North Korea] officials they believe news on CNN and other US media can be dictated by US government ... that\u2019s the way it works in their country so they believe it\u2019s just as monolithic here,\u201d Herman posted in two tweets. Some Republicans seem to have realized they can use the morning show to communicate directly with the president. Earlier in the week, Senate hopeful and Trump cheerleader Danny Tarkanian announced on Fox and Friends that he will challenge the Republican incumbent US senator in Nevada, Dean Heller. Rather than giving the exclusive to a Nevada-based media outlet, he told Fox &amp; Friends: \u201cWe are never going to make America great again unless you have senators in office who fully support president Trump and his America First agenda.\u201d The live clip was tweeted by Fox &amp; Friends not long after 7am ET, when most of Nevada was still in bed but there was a good chance that one particular viewer in Washington DC would be glued to the screen.",
