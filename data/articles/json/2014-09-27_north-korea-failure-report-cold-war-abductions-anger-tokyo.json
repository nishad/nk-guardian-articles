    "content": "Hopes for an imminent resolution to North Korea\u2019s abductions of Japanese citizens during the Cold War have dimmed after Pyongyang failed to produce a promised report on its initial investigation into the missing people. Having agreed to pass on their findings by the end of this month, North Korean authorities have said that the probe could last up to a year, sparking anger in Tokyo. Establishing the whereabouts of a dozen Japanese citizens snatched in the 1970s and 80s and taken to North Korea to teach their language and customs to communist agents is an emotive topic in Japan, where it is considered more important than Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. Five of 17 people on Tokyo\u2019s official missing list were allowed to return home with their families in 2002, but Japan has refused to believe North Korean claims that it had abducted only 13 people, and that the remaining eight had died. Japan will demand an explanation for the delay when officials from both sides meet in Shenyang, China, on Monday. \u201cWhat will result from the meeting? I\u2019m not in a position to say\u2026 I can\u2019t speak in detail about Japan\u2019s expectations at this time,\u201d Eriko Yamatani, Japan\u2019s state minister in charge of the abduction issue, told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThe way North Korea deals with this will affect not just the abductions\u2026 it is an important test of how serious it is about addressing its human rights abuses.\u201d The cause of the delay isn\u2019t clear, but there have been suggestions that Pyongyang is unhappy with the way Japanese media have portrayed the abductions as a human rights issue, and that it hopes to win further concessions with each new piece of information. Despite the delay, Professor Hajime Izumi, director of the Center for Korean Studies at Shizuoka University, said he was confident North Korea would present an initial report on its investigation, possibly by the end of next month. \u201cThis will proceed on the basis of a comprehensive plan of action,\u201d Izumi said. \u201cIf North Korea does something, then Japan will be expected to do something in return.\u201d Izumi believes North Korea could be holding out for the early resumption of a ferry service between the two countries \u2013 one of several conciliatory measures announced by Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in July after Pyongyang agreed to reopen its investigation into the abductions. The Mangyongbong-92, which once sailed regularly between Wonsan and Niigata, has not made the journey since sanctions were imposed in 2006. By delaying the process, North Korea may try to use it as a diplomatic card to get further concessions from Tokyo \u201cNorth Korea would probably want that to be first to happen, but in Japan the Mangyongbong has great symbolic value. It may have been involved in the abductions, so here it is still seen a something evil.\u201d In light of the breakdown of multiparty talks on North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme and the introduction of tough UN sanctions following its nuclear and missile tests, Abe appeared to be taking a gamble with the offer to ease Tokyo\u2019s punitive measures against the regime. Some analysts, however, say the current impasse probably won\u2019t damage Japan\u2019s leader, who has made resolving the abductions a priority of his political career. \u201cBy delaying the process, North Korea may try to use it as a diplomatic card to get further concessions from Tokyo,\u201d said Tetsuo Kotani, a fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs in Tokyo. \u201cOr North Korea needed to delay it because it knows it cannot meet Tokyo\u2019s high expectations. \u201cBy lifting the economic sanctions, Abe showed his pragmatic side. Because he had always been tough on the abduction issue, he could show some flexibility. Even if North Korea does not meet his expectations this time, it won\u2019t harm Abe\u2019s political foundations, because North Korea will be to blame.\u201d",
