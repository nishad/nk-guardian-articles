    "content": "British settlement was a \u201cvery good thing\u201d although not \u201cgood immediately for everyone\u201d, Tony Abbott has said. With Malcolm Turnbull in Japan meeting with his counterpart, Shinzo Abe, to discuss North Korea, security and trade, the former prime minister weighed in on the debate about moving Australia Day and praised Donald Trump\u2019s efforts in North Korea. When asked on 2GB radio about the Greens\u2019 renewed focus on changing the date from 26 January due to concerns it celebrates the day of British settlement and Indigenous dispossession, Abbott suggested advocates of change were \u201cembarrassed about our country\u201d. Abbott accused Labor of \u201cdeafening silence on the issue\u201d. \u201cTo the extent that any Labor party people have spoken here, they\u2019ve tried to have a bet each way, which is so typical,\u201d he said. On Thursday Bill Shorten said there was a \u201crange of views\u201d but he was \u201con the record as supporting Australia Day staying on January 26\u201d. \u201cI can respect that different people have different views,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see me sneering at Indigenous Australians who want to have a discussion about a different date for Australia Day.\u201d Abbott suggested Australians needed to \u201cbe unambiguous about our country: Australia is a great country. \u201cWe must work \u2026 to make ourselves better but we don\u2019t do that by wallowing in endless, carping self-criticism. \u201cBritish settlement was a very good thing \u2013 it wasn\u2019t good immediately for everyone. But the modern Australia that emerged from British settlement \u2026 is something that all of us, on balance, can and should be proud of. \u201cThis idea that we can rewrite history, this idea that we should never have been settled the way we were, (a) it\u2019s unrealistic and (b) it flies in the face of our country\u2019s historical achievement.\u201d At a press conference in Tokyo, Turnbull said that he and Abe were \u201cvery committed\u201d to concluding negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership when trade ministers next meet to discuss it in March. At a lunch function the Australian prime minister said the TPP, which was revived in 2017, would not have been possible without Japan and Australia pushing for it to continue after Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal. Turnbull said the TPP was likely to be a success that other countries would seek to join and was structured to allow the US to rejoin in future if it wished. Indonesia and China have already indicated a desire to join. With North Korea the focus of talks between Turnbull and Abe, the Australian prime minister dismissed suggestions that cooperation between North and South Korea on the Winter Olympics was a meaningful indicator of diplomatic success. He said the focus remained denuclearisation. \u201cWhen the regime shows real movement in that direction, I think that\u2019s where negotiations can begin in earnest,\u201d Turnbull told reporters. \u201cWe have to maintain the economic pressure from the sanctions and not to ... accept a sort of a lull from North Korea as an indication that they are going to change their ways.\u201d Turnbull said he agreed with the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, that the military option should remain on the table. Australia and Japan are pushing for closer defence ties and will later in 2018 sign a defence agreement that will provide a legal framework for more joint military exercises. Under the deal Japanese troops could conduct military exercises out of Darwin \u2013 almost 76 years after Japanese planes bombed the city in the second world war. Abbott said Trump had \u201cinjected a new element of firmness\u201d into the crisis on the Korean peninsula. \u201cAs a result, we\u2019ve seen the Chinese ratchet up the pressure on the North Koreans,\u201d he said. \u201cI find it a little dismaying. Instead of giving this guy credit, so many people, particularly on the left of politics, keep sneering at him.\u201d",
