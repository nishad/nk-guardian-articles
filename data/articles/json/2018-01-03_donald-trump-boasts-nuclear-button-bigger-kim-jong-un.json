    "content": "Donald Trump has taunted North Korea\u2019s leader about the size of his nuclear arsenal after his UN envoy, Nikki Haley, dismissed the value of proposed high-level talks between Pyongyang and Seoul. The US president used Kim Jong-un\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day speech as the basis for his latest provocative tweet against the leader, whom he has previously referred to as \u201clittle rocket man\u201d, saying the \u201cnuclear button\u201d in Washington is \u201cmuch bigger and more powerful\u201d than Kim\u2019s \u2013 \u201cand my button works!\u201d. In the speech, Kim warned the United States his country\u2019s nuclear forces were now \u201ccompleted\u201d, adding that the nuclear launch button was always within easy reach. Trump\u2019s retort came hours after Haley distanced the White House from proposed contacts between North and South Korea, saying it would not take any talks seriously if Pyongyang did not abandon its nuclear arsenal. A few hours later on Wednesday, the North reopened a vital line of communication with South, raising hopes of a diplomatic thaw. The president\u2019s tweet drew swift condemnation \u2013 and some snark \u2013 from Democrats and foreign policy experts. Reacting on CNN, Democratic congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut said Trump\u2019s tweet has \u201cFreudians\u201d abuzz and shows an impulse \u201cto demonstrate that his is bigger and stronger than anybody else\u2019s\u201d. However, Himes added, a more sobering consequence of Trump\u2019s hyperbolic rhetoric is that \u201cit really doesn\u2019t matter what the president of the United States says any more because it\u2019s so bizarre, strange, not true, infantile\u201d. Eliot Cohen, a former top official in the George W Bush administration and a Trump critic, said the president\u2019s pronouncement was \u201cspoken like a petulant 10-year-old\u201d. \u201cBut one with nuclear weapons \u2013 for real \u2013 at his disposal,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cHow responsible people around him, or supporting him, can dismiss this or laugh it off is beyond me.\u201d Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, a thinktank in Washington, noted that in the past 24 hours Trump has \u201cthreatened to 1) cut aid to nuclear-armed, terrorist-laden Pakistan; 2) cut aid to miffed Palestinians after he alters US Jerusalem policy, and 3) boasted his nuclear button is bigger than Kim Jong-un\u2019s. This is our commander-in-chief. Think about it.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday Trump had tweeted that the US-led campaign of sanctions and other pressure were beginning to have a \u201cbig impact\u201d on North Korea, referring to the recent escape of at least two North Korean soldiers across the heavily militarised border into South Korea. \u201cSoldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea. Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not \u2013 we will see!\u201d Trump tweeted. On Monday, in a speech broadcast live by state TV in North Korea, Kim said: \u201cThe US should know that the button for nuclear weapons is on my desk. This is not blackmail but reality.\u201d But he added that the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal played a purely deterrent role. \u201cThe entire area of the US mainland is within our nuclear strike range,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US can never start a war against me and our country. These weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.\u201d Associated Press contributed to this report.",
