For 11 hushed minutes on Thursday, many got to read the words they had waited to see since last November: \u201c@realDonaldTrump does not exist\u201d. It wasn\u2019t fake news. It wasn\u2019t even a glitch. A rogue worker, who was reportedly a contractor, at Twitter pulled the plug on the hyperactive president on Thursday evening on his or her last day of work. The internet erupted with social media users hailing the departing staffer as a hero \u2013 but the incident has raised new concerns about security at Twitter, and legal experts have begun speculating that the rogue worker could be prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

The woman on her bike was photographed raising her middle finger when Trump\u2019s vehicles passed her on their way out from the Trump National Golf Club on the banks of the Potomac river, on the outskirts of Washington DC. She repeated the gesture when she caught up with the motorcade.

Reporting for the Guardian, Jason Wilson explains how talk of this impending battle proliferated after Alex Jones claimed it was happening without any evidence. Spoiler alert: Mark Bray, historian and author of Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says no civil war is planned today/on Saturday.
