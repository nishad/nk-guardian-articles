    "content": "Tensions in the Korean peninsula have reached new heights, with Seoul expecting further missile launches after a sixth North Korean nuclear test was confirmed on Sunday. South Korean forces have carried out a simulated attack on the North\u2019s nuclear test site, with China said to be considering sanctions and Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, promising to lodge a strong protest at the latest nuclear test. While also talking up a military response, Donald Trump has threatened to stop trading \u201cwith any country doing business with North Korea\u201d. The UN security council meets later on Monday to discuss the issues. International reaction to the test has not been uniform, and we would like to understand what life is like for you if you live in the region. How are people where you live dealing with the news? If you are in South Korea, what do you think of the deployment of the controversial Thaad US missile defence system, designed to intercept incoming North Korean missiles? Were you in Japan when a missile was fired over the country in August? What other issues are important to you? Share your experiences What is the mood like where you live?
