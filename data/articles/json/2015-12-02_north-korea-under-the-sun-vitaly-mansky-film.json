    "content": "A new film on life in North Korea has caused a diplomatic row after the director used officially sanctioned shoots to demonstrate how the state manipulates its people. Authorities are said to have tried to prevent screenings of Under the Sun, a film that follows a North Korean girl as she prepares to celebrate the Day of the Shining Star, the birthday of former supreme leader Kim Jong-il. Directed by veteran film-maker Vitaly Mansky, the documentary crew gained unprecedented access to the country by making the North Korean regime an official production partner and allowing officials complete control over the script. But despite being watched constantly by government minders during filming, Mansky found a way to expose the propaganda machine by leaving the camera running while each shot was set up. The film reveals how government representatives seek to construct an image of an \u201cideal\u201d family, capturing the hectoring of officials as they tell the Koreans what to say, how to sit and when to smile. \u201cI wanted to make a film about the real Korea, but there\u2019s no real life in the way that we consider,\u201d said Mansky, who spent a year in the country filming. \u201cThere is just the creation of an image of the myth of a real life. So we made a film about fake reality.\u201d Under the Sun depicts a day in the life of a supposedly ordinary family in Pyongyang, following young Zin-mi who is about to join the Korean Children\u2019s Union pioneers. The script was written and locations pre-chosen by representatives of the North Korean government. Row But relations with the government became tense after the director presented his version of the material, prompting politicians in Moscow to publicly distance Russia from its involvement in the project. Shortly after the film\u2019s premiere at the Tallinn Black Nights film festival, an article by the former Russian minister of culture, Mikhail Shvydkoy, appeared in Rossiskaya Gazeta criticising the film-maker and his team for presenting the project as a \u201cfriendly collaboration\u201d when they applied for state support. Black Nights director Tiina Lokk downplayed rumours that the festival had been strongly urged by North Korean representatives to withdraw the film, but admitted: \u201cYes, there was some kind of pressure.\u201d Mansky said politicians had been scared off from associating with the film. \u201c[Shvydkoy] complained that we lied to our North Korean partners and should feel ashamed about that, because the people who helped to make this film could be killed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the Russian Federation want to remove their support of the film.\u201d He said he had started out making a film in line with North Korean specifications, in which a girl would emerge as \u201cone pixel of a larger picture\u201d \u2013 but his experience during the year-long shoot changed his approach. He said minders had had \u201ctotal control\u201d over the filming process. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t say who they really are but we understood that all the decisions were made at the highest level,\u201d he said. \u201cThey opened a special office in the hotel where we were staying and every day after shooting we had to give our material to them. They gave it back without censored frames. \u201cThere is no idea in North Korea about personal space, or the freedom to make a very simple decision about what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mansky said.. In one scene, Zin-mi praises the health-giving qualities of kimchi in preventing ageing and cancer, and Mansky allows the audience to see how the crew are instructed to reshoot the scene over and over until the North Korean minders are happy they\u2019ve achieved the right gusto. In another sequence, a factory forewoman gives a speech congratulating workers on their productivity while regime representatives can be heard demanding several takes and asking for heightened zeal each time. The film\u2019s official narrative says that Zin-mi\u2019s father is a garment factory worker, but an on-screen title added in post-production reveals that this role is fictional \u2013 the film crew learned later he is really a print journalist. \u201cThey have their own imagination of how it should be and for them it\u2019s quite logical that they\u2019re changing the occupation of the father,\u201d said Mansky. Propaganda In Mansky\u2019s view, the DPRK\u2019s propaganda machine will always reveal evidence of its own lies. \u201cPropaganda is also counter-propaganda,\u201d he says. \u201cMy idea was to shoot a film like Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s Triumph of the Will, which is both those at the same time.\u201d Born in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union, Mansky has shot within a Communist regime before (Motherland or Death in Cuba), and says part of his drive is a will to understand how his parents lived. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in the concept of freedom and its lack.\u201d Describing communism as \u201cagainst real life\u201d, he claims: \u201cIn the Soviet Union people of course didn\u2019t have freedom, but they were free inside their minds. In North Korea there is no such kind of freedom. That\u2019s the tragedy of the society. They just don\u2019t imagine that there\u2019s another kind of life.\u201d",
