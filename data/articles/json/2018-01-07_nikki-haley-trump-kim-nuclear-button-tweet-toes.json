    "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s tweet taunting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un over the size of his \u201cnuclear button\u201d was meant to \u201ckeep Kim on his toes\u201d, the US ambassador to the United Nations said on Sunday. Rare progress has recently been made over the Korean standoff, with North and South agreeing to begin their first talks for two years on Tuesday in the South Korean side of the village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone. The forthcoming Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang will dominate the agenda but officials have indicated other issues may also be discussed. Trump, however, showed a characteristic disregard for diplomatic niceties when he wrote on Tuesday: \u201cNorth Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the \u2018Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times\u2019. \u201cWill someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d The tweet was written the day before the Guardian published extracts of a book in which White House staffers question the president\u2019s mental capacity for his job, setting off a political firestorm. In an opinion piece for the Guardian on Sunday, Bandy Lee, an assistant clinical professor at the Yale School of Medicine who has briefed members of Congress on the risks associated with the president\u2019s behaviour, wrote: \u201cTrump views violence as a solution when he is stressed and desires to re-establish his power. \u201cParanoia and overwhelming feelings of weakness and inadequacy make violence very attractive, and powerful weapons very tempting to use \u2013 all the more so for their power. \u201cHis contest with the North Korean leader about the size of their nuclear buttons is an example of that and points to the possibility of great danger by virtue of the power of his position.\u201d Asked on ABC\u2019s This Week if Trump\u2019s tweet was a good idea at a time of high tension between the US and Pyongyang, Haley said: \u201cI think [Trump] always has to keep Kim on his toes. It\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t ever let [Kim] get so arrogant that he doesn\u2019t realise the reality of what would happen if he started a nuclear war.\u201d Host George Stephanopoulos countered that even senior Senate Republicans Corey Gardner and John Cornyn said Trump\u2019s tweet was reckless. \u201cYou know, everyone\u2019s going to have their opinion,\u201d Haley said. \u201cWhat I can tell you is I\u2019m dealing with the diplomats on the ground, I\u2019m dealing with all the actors in this situation. \u201cIt is a serious situation and [Kim] can\u2019t sit there and imply that he\u2019s going to destroy the United States without us reminding him of the facts and the reality that if you go there, it\u2019s not us that\u2019s going to be destroyed, it\u2019s you.\u201d The CIA director, Mike Pompeo, also defended Trump, telling CBS\u2019s Face the Nation the tweet was \u201cconsistent with US policy\u201d, which seeks the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Pompeo also said he believed North Korea was months away from being able to put a US city at risk of nuclear attack. He declined to be more precise. Trump has regularly taunted Kim on social media and in speeches with the name \u201cRocket Man\u201d or \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d. He has also consistently implied that only military action will work. In August, he said threats from Pyongyang would \u201cbe met with fire and the fury like the world has never seen\u201d, a statement that gave Michael Wolff\u2019s book its title. In October, the president said talking to the North Koreans would be a \u201cwaste of time\u201d for his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. On Saturday, though, Trump told a press conference at Camp David he would be open to phone talks with Kim. \u201cThere is no turnaround,\u201d Haley told ABC. \u2018What [Trump] has basically said is \u2018Yes, there could be a time when we talk to North Korea but a lot of things have to happen before that actually takes place. They have to be willing to talk about banning their nuclear weapons.\u2019\u201d That would mean Pyongyang suspending its tests of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, an unlikely step. At Camp David, Trump also appeared to take credit for the scheduled talks between North and South. The president said: \u201cA lot of people have said and a lot of people have written that without my rhetoric and without my tough stance \u2013 and it\u2019s not just a stance, I mean this is what has to be done \u2013 that they wouldn\u2019t be talking about Olympics, they wouldn\u2019t be talking right now.\u201d Haley said it was not her \u201cunderstanding\u201d North and South Korea would \u201ctalk about anything further\u201d than the Olympics.",
