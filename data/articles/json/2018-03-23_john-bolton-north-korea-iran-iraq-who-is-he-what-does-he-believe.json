    "content": "Fifteen years ago to the week, the US began its invasion and occupation of Iraq. Among the war\u2019s many architects and cheerleaders was John Bolton, at the time a senior adviser to George W Bush on issues of arms control and international security. And while many early invasion supporters have, in the clear view of hindsight, conceded that the decade-plus long odyssey was at least misguided, Bolton has reached no such conclusion. Even in the war-happy neoconservative Bush administration, Bolton stood out - a hawk among hawks - and his post-Bush career as a public commentator certainly didn\u2019t see those leanings tempered. He has advocated, to various degrees, pre-emptive strikes and wars against North Korea and Iran, and overall an aggressive military interventionist programme around the world, coupled with staunch anti-immigration rhetoric. Late Thursday, Bolton, who is scheduled to takeover for HR McMaster as Trump\u2019s national security advisor on 9 April, said on Fox News that all those pronouncements were behind him as he prepares for his new role in the White House. \u201cDuring my career, I have written I don\u2019t know how many articles and op-eds and opinion pieces. I have given I can\u2019t count the number of speeches, I have countless interviews ... in the past 11 years. They\u2019re all out there in the public record. I have never been shy about what my views are,\u201d Bolton said, adding later, \u201cFrankly, what I have said in private now is behind me.\u201d He concluded: \u201cThe important thing is what the president says and the advice I give him.\u201d Still, here are some of Bolton\u2019s most aggressive published views in recent memory which may offer window into exactly what kind of advice he may be about to give to Trump. Don\u2019t talk to North Korea In August, when defense secretary Jim Mattis and former secretary of state Rex Tillerson co-published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal outlining their philosophy on North Korea, Bolton said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the tack. \u201cTime is not a neutral factor here. Time is an asset for the proliferator,\u201d he said on Fox News. \u201cMore negotiation with North Korea? I think they\u2019d say bring it on. More time to increase the size and scope of their ballistic missile and nuclear capabilities. \u201cThe object of our peaceful pressure campaign is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Tillerson and Mattis had written. \u201cDiplomacy is our preferred means of changing North Korea\u2019s course of action.\u201d Preemptive strike on North Korea In a seeming retread of Dick Cheney\u2019s infamous insistence that we not wait until the \u201csmoking gun\u201d is a \u201cmushroom cloud\u201d with respect to Iraq, Bolton argued in the Wall Street Journal in February that a lack of intelligence about North Korea\u2019s missile program could justify a military first strike. \u201cThe threat is imminent, and the case against pre-emption rests on the misinterpretation of a standard that derives from prenuclear, pre-ballistic-missile times,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGiven the gaps in US intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute. That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation. It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018necessity\u2019 posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d Preemptive strike on Iran In a 2015 op-ed in the New York Times headlined To Stop Iran\u2019s Bomb, Bomb Iran, Bolton wrote: \u201cThe inescapable conclusion is that Iran will not negotiate away its nuclear program. Nor will sanctions block its building a broad and deep weapons infrastructure\u2026 \u201cAn attack need not destroy all of Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, but by breaking key links in the nuclear-fuel cycle, it could set back its program by three to five years. The United States could do a thorough job of destruction\u2026 \u201cTime is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.\u201d The piece was published about three months before Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state John Kerry helped successfully negotiate a non-proliferation deal that saw Iran agree to a 98% reduction in its enriched uranium stockpile and a 15-year pause in the development of key weapons infrastructure. That deal is now in peril under Trump. No humanitarian obligation to accept Syrian Refugees \u201cWe have no obligation to bring them into this country,\u201d Bolton told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro in 2015 as millions were fleeing the ongoing civil war. Bolton added that in his estimation the US can refuse to allow Syrian refugees entry \u201cwithout in any way violating our humanitarian obligations\u201d. The only mistake made in Iraq was leaving Iraq In the Daily Telegraph in 2016, Bolton wrote that: \u201cIraq today suffers not from the 2003 invasion, but from the 2011 withdrawal of all US combat forces. What strengthened Iran\u2019s hand in Iraq was not the absence of Saddam [Hussein], but the absence of coalition troops with a writ to crush efforts by the ayatollahs to support and arm Shi\u2019ite militias. When US forces left, the last possibility of Iraq succeeding as a multi-ethnic, multi-confessional state left with them. Don\u2019t blame Tony Blair and George W Bush for that failure. Blame their successors.\u201d Terrorism is a war, not a crime In the wake of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris Bolton opined for Fox News that \u201cThis is not a matter for the criminal law, as many American political and academic leaders, including the President [Obama], have insisted\u2026 This is a war\u2026 \u201cThe mechanism of response must be to destroy the source of the threat, not prosecute it, not contain it, not hope that we will \u2018ultimately\u2019 destroy it. \u2018Ultimately\u2019 is too far away. \u201cKnee-jerk, uninformed and often wildly inaccurate criticisms of programs (such as several authorized in the wake of 9/11 in the Patriot Act) have created a widespread misimpression in the American public about what exactly our intelligence agencies have been doing and whether there was a \u2018threat\u2019 to civil liberties. Now is the time to correct these misimpressions, and to rebut the unfounded criticisms.\u201d Nobody tell Bolton\u2019s new boss, who has dabbled in \u201cdeep-state\u201d conspiracy thinking throughout his administration.",
