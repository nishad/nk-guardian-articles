    "content": "A generation of North Koreans as familiar with the American dollar as Kim Il-sung is set to dramatically shake up the country, according to young defector Sungju Lee. Calling those born after 1990 the \u201cmarket generation\u201d, the 28-year-old says young people are likely to trigger major social and economic changes in the closed-off communist country over the next 20 years. Capitalism has become an influential force in their lives, Lee says, with nostalgia for life under the \u201cfirst dictator\u201d \u2013 when North Korea was a new nation and widespread famine had not yet been experienced \u2013 no longer entrenching a sense of patriotism. But Lee, who left the country 2002 and is now studying in UK, says the shift won\u2019t be a result of a rejection of the regime\u2019s us-against-the-world message, but rather because this propaganda is no longer powerful enough to trump the lure of the markets. \u201cPeople of my generation hate the United States but they love the dollar. They hate Japan but they love the yen. Some might hate China but they love the yuan,\u201d he says. Lee gives the example of 2009 reforms, which were designed to crack down on the growing power of the private enterprise and revive socialism. This was a \u201chuge fail\u201d, he claims, and demonstrated that \u201cNorth Korea cannot control the markets\u201d. Evidence suggests that the so-called market generation has better access than ever to information from the outside world through illegally smuggled DVDs, films and mobile phones. Street gangs Lee\u2019s father, a former bodyguard in Kim Il-sung\u2019s personal security force, defected when his son was just 12 years old. His mother abandoned him soon after, leaving him to fend for himself on the streets of Hwasong in the north-east. Lee says he did what was \u201cnormal\u201d to survive: he formed a gang with his friends, and \u201cslept in the train station. I was a pickpocket. I fought everyday... I lost two friends on the streets.\u201d In a passage from his book, Every Falling Star, due to be released in September, the defector describes the experience of being an abandoned child in North Korea. They came at us, waving metal pipes and broken bottles. Everything became a blur as arms flailed toward and around me. My mind couldn\u2019t keep up with my body, so I just stopped thinking and, as my tae kwon do master had taught me, let technique take over. I heard that thump of a fist pounding on flesh, and I started kicking anything in front of me. Then I saw blood... blood pouring from my brothers\u2019 faces and onto their shirts. I attacked even harder then. I started swinging my T-shirts of stones, hearing them crunch against bone. Much later, my brothers would tell me I was like a superhuman When he was 14, Lee was captured by the \u201cSang-mu\u201d, a public official, and put into a shelter for street kids. The shelter, where children were forced to clean the streets and carry out other public tasks, is more accurately described as \u201ca grave\u201d, Lee adds. \u201cPeople died and we had to bury them with small shovels. We worked and worked and the food was horrible. During the potato season we got potatoes, during the radish season we ate just radishes,\u201d he says. On 23 October 2002, when he was 16 years old, Lee\u2019s life took a dramatic turn. \u201cI cannot forget that date it was a huge turning point in my life,\u201d he says. He was offered the opportunity to escape the country, starting his long journey to becoming the first North Korean student ever to study at the UK\u2019s Warwick University. Fake passport to PhD Lee was was approached by a broker carrying a letter from his father inviting him to join him. It said: \u201cSon i\u2019m living in China [and] i\u2019m living well. Come.\u201d \u201c[The broker] told me he was my father\u2019s best friend, but he was just a business man,\u201d says Lee. The man gave Lee a fake passport, allowing him to fly to South Korea days later. Like many defectors he then spent more than a decade trying to adjust to a new life in the midst of a \u201chuge identity crisis... here I was with my [Korean] brothers and sisters but I was being treated like a foreigner,\u201d he says. \u201cMany defectors are timid because they have strong northern accents, they don\u2019t know anything beyond North Korea and they are scared to make mistakes.\u201d He says North Koreans come from a deeply engrained communist culture where if \u201cone person says something different from what the community is thinking, people report them\u201d. Lee is now studying for a masters degree at Warwick University with the support of the UK government. When he finishes he wants to apply for a PhD in Korean unification: one of the world\u2019s longest running diplomatic stand-offs. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I can go home and see my friends,\u201d he says.",
