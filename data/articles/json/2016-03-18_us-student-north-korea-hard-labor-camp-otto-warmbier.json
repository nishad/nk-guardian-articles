    "content": "The distraught pleadings of the American college student sentenced to 15 years of hard labour in a prison in North Korea for \u201ccrimes against the state\u201d are sobering when considering the details of what such punishment normally entails. The pariah state ruled three days ago that Otto Warmbier, 21, from Cincinnati, Ohio, was guilty of a heinous political crime committed with the \u201ctacit connivance of the US government and its manipulation\u201d and deserved harsh treatment. The crime the University of Virginia commerce student had allegedly carried out was the petty theft of a political propaganda poster from his vacation hotel in Pyongyang. But hard labour in North Korean political prison camps, which were first set up in the late 1940s or early 1950s, can be doled out as punishment for the slightest perceived dissent towards the totalitarian ruling dynasty. Korean citizens who have survived the ordeal and escaped the regime emerge with harrowing tales of the compatriots and family members who didn\u2019t make it \u2013 most killed off by the cruel combination of prolonged near-starvation and slavish forced labour. \u201cConditions are horrific. People are worked for 14, 15 or 16 hours every day with just a handful of corn to live on and they are intentionally starved and worked to death,\u201d said Suzanne Scholte, chairman of the North Korea freedom coalition, a group of organizations based in Washington DC assisting defectors and campaigning for improved human rights. \u201cTorture is common, there is no medical aid and the sanitation is horrible. They wear the torn uniforms of old prisoners and sleep crammed together in a room.\u201d North Korea denies the existence of vast political prison camps, but according to a 2014 UN special commission report, a combination of satellite imagery and extensive human testimony proves they are still in operation and are used to perpetrate \u201cunspeakable atrocities\u201d on hapless citizens, who simply disappear with no word to their families even if they subsequently die in detention. The UN reported systematic starvation, torture, rape and many executions at such camps, which hold an estimated total of 80,000 to 120,000 prisoners in the most wretched conditions. \u201cThe commission estimates that hundreds of thousands of political prisoners have perished in these camps over the past five decades,\u201d the report said. A 2009 legal report from South Korea cited prisoners being fed starvation rations of a few ounces of rotten corn and some kind of thin \u201csalt soup\u201d. \u201cThey lose their teeth, their gums turn black, their bones weaken and, as they age, they hunch over at the waist \u2026 they live and die in rags, without soap, socks or underwear,\u201d the Washington Post reported at the time. Former prisoners sentenced to just 18 months hard labour recalled fellow inmates not surviving amid the constant beatings and malnutrition. They often work in the fields, logging in forests, down mines with no safety measures or crude factories where injuries are rampant, Scholte said. And in another account, a man who was arrested as a teenager trying to sneak out of North Korea, Hyuk Kim, recalled subsisting at a lower-level labour camp by catching rats, drying them out and eating the flesh raw. \u201cIf you tried to cook the rats, the guards would smell the meat or fire, catch you and beat you mercilessly,\u201d the 33-year-old defector later said. Campaigners said US student Warmbier would undoubtedly be terrified of his prospects. He has been detained by the North Korean authorities since late January and has had no contact with his parents back home in Ohio. Although Kim Jong-un is unpredictable, Scholte said it is unlikely the young American would end up doing years of hard labour in the country\u2019s worst camps. \u201cThis student will not be sent to one of these death camps because they cannot let the world know that they are committing these atrocities. They may put him to work in a labour camp but I would suspect for six months or, I hope, less than a year. They are going to use him and it will depend how much the US pushes the regime to release him,\u201d she said. Scholte is taking part in a panel at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Friday, where North Korean women who have survived imprisonment and the daily deprivations and abuses of ordinary life in the country are scheduled to relate their experiences to the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, and other leading figures. American Kenneth Bae was released by North Korea in November 2014 after almost two years imprisoned by the regime, for evangelizing Christianity in the country, which is banned. He was forced to do agricultural labour daily and suffered numerous health and psychological problems, but returned home having been spared the bulk of his 15-year sentence. John Sifton, Asia policy director for Human Rights Watch, said North Korea\u2019s actions were becoming increasingly unpredictable but praised the latest sanctions agreed by the US on Wednesday because they are designed to protest not just North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons aggression but also its despicable human rights record, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare there \u2013 if you are really in trouble you get sent to a camp where you will never come out. It\u2019s astonishing in 2016 that this is still going on. However, this student is useful to the North Korean regime and they may not want to work him to death as they do their own citizens,\u201d he said.",
