    "content": "After the morning session of speeches on the first day of this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference, it\u2019s clear, as usual, that conservatives are not fans of President Obama\u2019s policies. Most of them, though, seem to realize that just running against the Obama administration\u2019s record won\u2019t be enough to score the sound victory they want out of November\u2019s midterm elections. As Utah senator Mike Lee put it, conservatives cannot \u201cexpect to win elections by default\u201d. He aligned himself with a generation of new conservatives, like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, who are putting forth a \u201cnew agenda\u201d to \u201crescue at-risk communities with too few jobs \u2026 and little hope.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop talking like Ronald Reagan and start acting like him,\u201d Lee said. The speakers offered policies that they hoped would serve as counterweights to Obama\u2019s focus on income inequality. Beyond this framing, though, the ideas weren\u2019t anything especially new for the GOP. Former vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan, the House budget committee chairman and possible 2016 candidate, stressed that the party needs to make the case that \u201cequal outcomes\u201d aren\u2019t \u201cnearly as enriching as equal opportunity\u201d. Florida senator Marco Rubio, too, railed against burdensome regulations that are manageable for \u201cmillion or billion\u201d dollar companies, but crushing for those trying to start a business \u201cfrom their garages\u201d. Opening speaker Ted Cruz, the Texas senator who has made himself into something of a standard-bearer for the conservative wing of the GOP, laid out a list of items \u2013 some more concrete than others \u2013 for conservatives to run on in the midterms, including a lifetime ban on lobbying for retired members of Congress, a \u201cstrong balanced budget amendment\u201d and, of course, the repeal of Obamacare. He said that the party can\u2019t give up on young voters and needs to explain to them how \u201cthe Obama agenda has been horrible for young people\u201d. Reagan, he noted, was a \u201cseptuagenarian\u201d, but still managed to court young voters on the strength of his ideas. Two governors who spoke, New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie and Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal, also stressed the need to beat Democrats on ideas and not just on the pendulum swings of election cycles. Naturally, they emphasized that governors, having served as executives and not just \u201ctalkers,\u201d would be the people best prepared to help their party do that. \u201cRepublican governors have stood up and done things, not just talked about them,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start talking about what we\u2019re for and not what we\u2019re against... Because our ideas are better than their ideas.\u201d But beyond all the brainstorming on domestic policy, the speakers also couldn\u2019t resist taking shots at Obama\u2019s handling of the short-term foreign policy issue du jour, Russia\u2019s aggression towards Ukraine, and Obama\u2019s perceived weakness in managing that and other geopolitical conflicts. For a movement that\u2019s been split over the last few years between hawks and (relative) isolationists, the hawks certainly had the rhetorical upper hand on Thursday. Rubio, who\u2019s been outspokenly critical of Obama\u2019s handling of the Ukraine crisis, warned, perhaps hyperbolically, that a world where the United States could be nuked by North Korea from the west and Iran from the east is a \u201creal possibility\u201d without \u201cAmerican engagement.\u201d Christie, whose limited public statements about foreign policy have drifted towards the internationalist end of the spectrum, said the GOP must be \u201cfor America being a leader in the world\u201d backed by \u201ca strong national defense, one that doesn\u2019t allow leaders to run over us all around the world.\u201d Former UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk\u2019s hawk, played to type, declaring, \u201cwe do not accept an America that is weak and declining, we do not accept an American military that is weak and poorly equipped, and in particular, we do not accept an American president who is weak and indecisive and apologetic about our country.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what tough actions these speakers were proposing as alternatives. But it can\u2019t all be figured out in one morning.",
