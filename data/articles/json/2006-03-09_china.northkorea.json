Japan's Kyodo news agency cited a \"security source\" in China as saying the missiles were fired towards China by mistake during a military drill, and apparently landed in the North. The agency also cited a \"western military source\" as saying that the short-range missiles were test-fired easterly towards the Sea of Japan. At least one landed in the sea.",
