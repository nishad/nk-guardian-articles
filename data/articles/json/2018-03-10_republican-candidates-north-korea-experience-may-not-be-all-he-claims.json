    "content": "North Korea rarely plays a prominent role in US congressional elections, but Rick Saccone \u2013 the Republican candidate for Congress in Tuesday\u2019s crucial special election in Pennsylvania \u2013 has made much of his experience in the reclusive country. A television advertisement features moody shots of a missile launch and goose-stepping North Korean soldiers \u2013 and Saccone\u2019s claim that his career as \u201ca diplomat in North Korea\u201d makes him uniquely placed to deal with the looming crisis over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme. Saccone\u2019s campaign website says that he \u201cspent one year on a diplomatic mission in North Korea\u201d and describes him as \u201cthe only United States citizen living in North Korea that negotiated with the North Korean regime on a daily basis\u201d. But the four-term state legislator may be overstating his role. According to former colleagues, although Saccone is one of the few Americans to have dealt with North Korean officials, he was not a diplomat, and was not engaged in traditional diplomacy. \u201cFrom what I have heard, he has tended to embellish his role,\u201d said David Lambertson, a former US diplomat who held the same position as Saccone in North Korea. Both were US representatives for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, (KEDO), a nuclear power plant project in North Korea that was designed to give Pyongyang civilian nuclear power without the ability to make weapons. KEDO was the result of Bill Clinton-era negotiations that began in 1994 and slowly fell apart before formally ending in 2006. The agreement required at least one American to be on site, as well as representatives from Japan and South Korea. The building site where Saccone spent his time was in Kumho, about 270 kilometres (165 miles) from Pyongyang. The close race between Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb in a district that Donald Trump won overwhelmingly in 2016 has become a major test of Republican strength ahead of the 2018 midterms. And after this week\u2019s shock announcement that Trump had accepted an invitation to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, Saccone\u2019s experience in Kumho has taken on fresh relevance. Questions about the precise nature of that experience were first raised by blogger Warren Throckmorton. According to Lambertson, substantial negotiations over KEDO would take place in Pyongyang, with US staff flown in from New York. Lambertson attended these meetings but described his presence at negotiations as \u201cmore of an observer\u201d. \u201cSaccone\u2019s experience would have been exactly the same: he was not negotiating highly sensitive matters with the North Koreans by any means,\u201d he added. Kim Joong-keun, the South Korean representative on the project who worked with Saccone, agreed that the candidate\u2019s account was \u201cinaccurate\u201d. \u201cFrankly speaking, he didn\u2019t meet any important North Koreans,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThere was a lot more contact between North Koreans and South Koreans. \u201cOf all the Americans I worked with, I would rank Saccone at the bottom.\u201d Kim said that meetings typically took place twice a month \u2013 a far cry from the claims in Saccone\u2019s campaign literature. \u201cOnce the framework was signed, there was no political negotiations going on with KEDO, it was a $5 billion construction project,\u201d said Joel Wit, a former state department official who was instrumental in establishing KEDO and oversaw the agreement with North Korea. \u201cIf you want to talk to people who knew about the project, he wouldn\u2019t be one of them\u201d. Bob Branstetter, a spokesman for Saccone said: \u201cRick was the American representative for the Korea Peninsula Energy Development Organization inside North Korea from December 2000 to December 2001.\u201d He added that Saccone \u201cinteracted daily with the North Koreans regarding the implementation of the agreed framework\u201d and \u201cserved in a diplomatic capacity for KEDO\u201d. Branstetter also sent a picture of Saccone shaking hands with another man over a conference table lined with full glasses of beer. He added: \u201cWhat is portrayed in the photo is the definition of diplomacy. In the photo, Rick was shaking hands with North Korean officials immediately after signing an agreement negotiated by Rick and the North Koreans to give access to the beach area for the KEDO workers.\u201d Branstatter also provided an image of a commemorative plate given to Saccone after he left KEDO. It bore the names of six KEDO co-workers. The first name listed was that was of Kim. Branstattter said Saccone \u201cinteracted with North Koreans virtually every single day during his year in the country\u201d. Although Saccone has said that he lived in North Korea for one year, Lambertson and Kim said his position was shared among two or three people, with each rotating in for a maximum period of about six weeks. Despite his experience in North Korea, Saccone has hesitated to share explicit views on how Washington should engage with Pyongyang. In an interview earlier in March, he declined to comment on the wisdom of a pre-emptive airstrike against North Korea. \u201cI\u2019m not privy to exactly what the adminstration\u2019s strategy is,\u201d said Saccone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to second-guess a strategy that may be going on behind the scenes until I get there and then I can advise how to make this work.\u201d",
