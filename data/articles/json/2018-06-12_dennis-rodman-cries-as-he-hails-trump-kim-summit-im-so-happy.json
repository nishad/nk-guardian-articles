    "content": "Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump had barely exchanged pleasantries outside the Capella hotel when their mutual friend Dennis Rodman appeared on TV to provide a characteristically bizarre sideshow to the main event in Singapore. In a rambling interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo from Singapore, a highly emotional Rodman claimed credit for predicting that today\u2019s summit \u2013 which seemed unlikely just months ago \u2013 would happen. Wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap and a T-shirt bearing the name of his sponsor Potcoin, Rodman sobbed as he described his feelings about the summit and recalled the abuse he had received over his controversial visits to Pyongyang to meet Kim. \u201cI said to everybody, the door will open,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s amazing. When I said those things, when I went back home, I got so many death threats \u2026 and I believed in North Korea, and I couldn\u2019t even go home, I couldn\u2019t even go home, I had to hide out for 30 days, I couldn\u2019t even go home. \u201cBut I kept my head high, brother, I knew things were going to change \u2026 I knew it, I was the only one. I never had no one to hear me, I had no one to see me. But I took all those bullets, I took all at that \u2026 but I\u2019m still standing. Today is a great day for everybody, Singapore, Tokyo, China, everybody \u2026 it\u2019s a great day. I\u2019m here to see it. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d The former NBA star is one of the few westerners to have met Kim, with whom he struck up an unlikely friendship over their shared love of basketball. Describing his meetings with Kim, Rodman said: \u201cHe\u2019s more like a big kid, even though he\u2019s small. He wants to come to America. He wants to enjoy his life.\u201d Rodman said he had tried to pass on what he heard from Kim to Barack Obama but was \u201cbrushed off\u201d. Rodman said he had earned Kim\u2019s trust after making good on a promise to take a team of ex-NBA players to North Korea in 2014. \u201cI gave him something for his birthday \u2026 I said: I\u2019m going to bring a professional basketball team to you,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cHe said: Can you do that. I said: Yes I can. Even though I couldn\u2019t do it, I knew if I fail now there is going to be a problem. But I got Potcoin here helped me out, my sponsor, fetch those guys and it happened. And Kim Jong-un came to me and said: \u2018Dennis - you know what this is the first time someone has ever kept their word to me and my country\u2019.\u201d Rodman said he believed Trump \u201cwill understand that the people of North Korea have a heart, have a soul, charisma and love each other\u201d. \u201cI think that country is normally hearing people who are always lying, deceitful and not trustworthy. I think that if President Trump goes in there with a great heart, with his heart on the table and let Kim Jong-un see him really emotional \u2026 it ain\u2019t got to be about war, it ain\u2019t got to be about hatred or what happened in the past. \u201cI\u2019ve told people about Kim Jong-un. He all about the 21st Century. He\u2019s trying to progress his country.\u201d Rodman arrived at Changi airport late on Monday amid speculation that he might even join the talks between the two leaders. The White House has since said that he will play no role in the discussions. The former Celebrity Apprentice contestant, who has visited North Korea several times and met Kim three times since 2013, claimed the president had thanked him for his efforts to being the two men together, saying a White House secretary had called to say that Trump was \u201cproud\u201d of him. That is in direct contradiction to a 2014 tweet by Trump, who said Rodman was \u201cdelusional\u201d for wanting him to visit North Korea.",
