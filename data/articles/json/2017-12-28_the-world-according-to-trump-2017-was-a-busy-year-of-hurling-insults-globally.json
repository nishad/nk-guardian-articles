    "content": "Of all the calamities that have marked Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, one of the most omnipresent has been his approach to diplomatic relations. The president has lashed out at a swath of countries during his 13 months in office, sometimes on issues relating to national security, but more often for seemingly no reason at all. Trump is, at least, consistent in his treatment of foreign powers \u2013 criticizing both enemies and supposed allies alike. Here are some of the countries that have upset the president. France Trump, in what would become a theme, used terrorist attacks to criticize France in February. Apparently referencing the Paris attacks that killed 130 people in November 2015 and the truck attack in Nice in July 2016, Trump lamented that a friend of his who used to like visiting Paris would no longer visit the city. \u201cI have a friend, he\u2019s a very, very substantial guy. He loves the City of Lights, he loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris, was automatic with his wife and his family. \u201cHadn\u2019t seen him in a while. And I said, \u2018Jim, let me ask you a question: how\u2019s Paris doing?\u2019 \u201c[Jim said]: \u2018Paris? I don\u2019t go there any more. Paris is no longer Paris.\u2019\u201d In March the New Yorker launched an investigation into whether Jim actually exists. It seems unlikely that he does. Sweden \u201cYou look at what\u2019s happening,\u201d Trump told a crowd in Florida on 18 February. \u201cYou look at what\u2019s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?\u201d The comment came during a section of his speech when Trump was warning of the threat of terrorism, and seemed to imply that there had been an attack or incident in Sweden the night before. The fact that there had been no incident in Sweden the night before made it particularly difficult to believe. Trump never fully explained what had happened last night in Sweden. United Kingdom In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump was asked about a potential trade agreement with Britain \u2013 given the UK\u2019s imminent departure from the European Union. Trump\u2019s answer was not very in depth. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear the word Britain any more. It\u2019s very interesting. It\u2019s like, nope,\u201d the president said. Then he started talking about the British Open golf tournament. Australia Trump did not insult the country per se \u2013 just its prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. In his first official phone call with Australia\u2019s leader \u2013 a sort of get-to-know-you for world leaders \u2013 Trump told Turnbull he was dissatisfied with their conversation. \u201cI have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day,\u201d Trump said, according to the transcript of the call. The US president ended the call abruptly. Canada \u201cCanada, what they\u2019ve done to our dairy farm workers, it\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Trump said in April. \u201cFarmers in Wisconsin and New York state are being put out of business.\u201d The Canadian government has import tariffs in place to protect its dairy farmers, CNN explained, and had been accused of undercutting American farmers. Canada did not immediately respond. Mexico \u201cOne of the highest-crime nations in the world,\u201d Trump thundered back in August. He also accused Mexico \u2013 and Canada \u2013 of being \u201cvery difficult\u201d during the the Nafta renegotiation process. Of course, Trump has also talked regularly about the need for a wall, and repeatedly said Mexico will pay for it. \u201cOur country will not pay, under any circumstances, for a wall or physical barrier built on US territory along the Mexican border,\u201d Mexico\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs has said. Germany \u201cGermany owes vast sums of money to Nato and the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany,\u201d Trump said in March. Numerous media outlets reported that this was untrue. Nato members do not pay money to the organization. He also didn\u2019t shake Angela Merkel\u2019s hand when they met at the Oval Office. The next day, he dismissed reports that the meeting had been awkward and then tweeted that Germany owes \u201cvast sums of money to NATO &amp; the United States\u201d, which is false. North Korea Where to start. Trump has taken to calling Kim Jong-un \u201cRocket Man\u201d \u2013 surely one of the president\u2019s least effective nicknames \u2013 and has also referred to the North Korean leader as \u201ca mad man\u201d. Trump also believes North Korea is \u201ca country ruled by a cult\u201d. North Korea, through state media, has called Trump \u201can old lunatic\u201d, a \u201cmean trickster\u201d, a \u201cmentally deranged dotard\u201d, a \u201chuman reject\u201d and a \u201chideous criminal\u201d. So perhaps they\u2019re about even.",
