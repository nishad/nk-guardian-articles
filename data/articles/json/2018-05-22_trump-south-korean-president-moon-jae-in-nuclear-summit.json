    "content": "The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, is due to hold talks in the White House with Donald Trump on Tuesday amid growing uncertainty over Trump\u2019s planned North Korean summit in Singapore next month. Trump was reported by the New York Times to have been \u201csurprised and angered\u201d by a statement from a senior North Korean official last week that said the regime would never trade away its nuclear arsenal and would not settle for a \u201cone-sided\u201d outcome to Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong-un, due to take place on 12 June. Administration officials have repeatedly declared they expect North Korea to accept complete verifiable, irreversible disarmament at the summit, and that the US will accept nothing less. The North Koreans have stated their interest in \u201ccomplete denuclearisation\u201d of the Korean peninsula but they define it in different ways, including a phased mutual process in which the US would draw down its military presence in the region, and eventually all nuclear powers would reduce their reliance on nuclear arsenals. According to several accounts, the origins of the misunderstanding lay in the visit of President Moon\u2019s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, to Washington in early March after meeting Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. Chung was briefing the then US national security adviser, HR McMaster, on the outcome of the trip, when Trump called the two men into the Oval Office to brief him directly. He then insisted Chung make a statement to the press that evening outside the White House. In that 8 March statement, the South Korean official lavished praise on Trump, claiming that it has the president\u2019s \u201cleadership and his maximum pressure policy\u201d that had brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. He said Kim had declared himself to be \u201ccommitted to denuclearisation\u201d and was keen to meet Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think there were detailed talks when Chung came here,\u201d a former US official said. \u201cChung used the phrase \u2018complete denuclearisation in the right conditions\u2019, and I\u2019m not sure Trump really understood what that meant. He thought he could set the right conditions by offering huge incentives.\u201d The former officials went on: \u201cI think there was some element of the South Koreans exaggerating what the North Koreans were willing to do, but I doubt the South Korean would have said it would be complete disarmament with everything handed over before any economic and security benefits. It was about complete denuclearisation over a reasonable period of time providing the benefits were corresponding.\u201d In the weeks that followed Chung\u2019s visit, Trump claimed to have succeeded in dealing with the North Korean nuclear threat where his predecessors had failed. President Moon, keen to defuse tensions on the peninsula, said Trump should receive the Nobel peace prize, and the call for the award was taken up by crowds at Trump rallies. The White House military office has minted a commemorative coin in advance of the Singapore summit, which the coin describes as \u201cpeace talks\u201d with \u201csupreme leader\u201d Kim Jong-un, a title more often associated with the Iranian cleric Ali Khamenei. The optimism in the run-up to the Singapore meeting was punctured on Wednesday when a former North Korean negotiator, Kim Gye-gwan, who rejected \u201cunilateral nuclear abandonment\u201d and threatened withdrawal from the Singapore talks if US officials stuck to that negotiating position. He singled out John Bolton, McMaster\u2019s successor as national security adviser, who had said the US would apply the \u201cLibyan model\u201d to North Korea, a reference to Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s 2003 agreement to surrender his embryonic nuclear programme. To North Koreans, Bolton\u2019s remarks were a reminder that Gaddafi had been toppled and killed in 2011 after a Nato-backed insurgency \u2013 an impression that Trump reinforced last week by describing the \u201cLibyan model\u201d as the decimation of the country and warning that Kim would suffer the same fate as Gaddafi if he refused to make a deal. Moon is expected to use his visit to the White House to reassure Trump that diplomatic progress is possible and that the summit is a gamble worth taking. He may also suggest to Trump that his officials tone down their rhetoric in the run-up to Singapore. A South Korean official told the Washington Post on Monday that Bolton \u201cseems to think the US can fight another war on the Korean Peninsula, so from our perspective, as the people living on the Korean Peninsula, he is very dangerous\u201d.",
