    "content": "Donald Trump has issued another provocative warning to North Korea, suggesting that his threat to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the country was not \u201ctough enough\u201d. The US president told reporters that North Korea \u201cbetter get their act together or they\u2019re going to be in trouble like few nations ever have been in trouble in this world\u201d. Trump was speaking ahead of a national security briefing at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is on what he describes as a working vacation. The president\u2019s threat earlier this week to unleash \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d was widely condemned as unnecessarily incendiary. But far from toning down the rhetoric, Trump said on Thursday: \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t tough enough. They\u2019ve been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years, and it\u2019s about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries. So if anything, maybe that statement wasn\u2019t tough enough.\u201d Asked if the US is considering a preemptive strike, the president replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that. I never do.\u201d Trump went on to say that North Korea should be \u201cvery nervous\u201d if it is even thinking about launching an attack on the US or its allies. \u201cBecause things will happen to them like they never thought possible, OK? He\u2019s been pushing the world around for a long time.\u201d He also suggested that he would take a more lenient view of China\u2019s trade policies if it brings pressure to bear on Pyongyang. The latest remarks came after North Korea derided Trump\u2019s \u201cfire and fury\u201d warning as a \u201cload of nonsense\u201d and announced a detailed plan to launch missiles aimed at the waters off the coast of the US Pacific territory of Guam. A statement attributed to Gen Kim Rak-gyom, the head of the country\u2019s strategic forces, declared: \u201cSound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him.\u201d The general outlined a plan to carry out a demonstration launch of four intermediate-range missiles that would fly over Japan and then land in the sea around Guam, \u201cenveloping\u201d the island. \u201cThe Hwasong-12 rockets to be launched by the KPA [Korean People\u2019s Army] will cross the sky above Shimani, Hiroshima and Koichi prefectures of Japan,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThey will fly for 3,356.7km for 1,065 seconds and hit the waters 30 to 40km away from Guam.\u201d The statement said the plan for this show of force would be ready by the middle of this month and then await orders from the commander-in-chief, Kim Jong-un. The US has a naval base in Guam and the island is home to Andersen air base, which has six B-1B heavy bombers. According to NBC News, the non-nuclear bombers have made 11 practice sorties since May in readiness for a potential strike on North Korea. The remote island is home to 162,000 people. The White House insists that Trump\u2019s thinking has not changed since his dire threat. Lindsey Graham, a senator known to speak with him regularly, told the radio host Hugh Hewitt: \u201cIf negotiations fail, he is willing to abandon \u2018strategic patience\u2019 and use pre-emption. I think he\u2019s there mentally. He has told me this. \u201cSo I\u2019m 100% confident that if President Trump had to use military force to deny the North Koreans the capability to strike America with a nuclear-tipped missile, he would do that.\u201d Social media in the US continues to buzz with anxious predictions, dark humour and maps of what a nuclear blast area might look like in New York. The White House has done little to quell public fears. Sebastian Gorka, a national security adviser, told Fox News that the standoff was \u201canalogous to the Cuban missile crisis\u201d, which almost brought the US and Soviet Union to nuclear war in 1962. But analysts cautioned against exaggerating to the point of panic or overstating the danger posed by North Korea, which has been trading threats with the US for years. Anthony Cordesman, a former consultant to the defense and state departments, now based at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cPeople are looking at the risk now as much more immediate than it is. The North Korean tests now would not be able to establish reliability or accuracy. \u201cHistorically you\u2019re talking months or several years until you have the missile. Then you have to be convinced you have a nuclear weapon that would survive. Simply being shown a picture of something like a large basketball is not evidence of reliability.\u201d The analyst added: \u201cEven the ability to hit a city-sized target with any predictability can take significant time even after you get the components. This is not to say any of it won\u2019t happen, but to say it\u2019s going to happen now is ridiculous. It\u2019s like being in the Cuban missile crisis without any missiles and without any nuclear weapons.\u201d According to Cordesman, widely reported projections of the death toll in South Korea are also hyped because they are based on the notion that its citizens would stay and wait to be targets of day after day of bombardment, while both the South Korean and the US military did nothing. \u201cThe estimates of North Korean artillery casualties in Seoul are absurd but everyone is quoting them without asking where they come from. That\u2019s typical. It\u2019s one thing to have a worst-case analysis; it\u2019s another thing to not say it\u2019s the worst-case analysis.\u201d South Korea\u2019s military said on Thursday that North Korea\u2019s statements were a challenge to Seoul and the US-South Korea alliance. Joint chiefs of staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon told a media briefing that South Korea was prepared to act immediately against any North Korean provocation. Japan\u2019s chief government spokesman said the country could \u201cnever tolerate this\u201d. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s actions are obviously provocative to the region as well as to the security of the international community,\u201d Yoshihide Suga said. The announcement on the North Korean state news service KCNA came at the end of two days of brinksmanship which began with the leak of a US intelligence report that Pyongyang had developed a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile. This was followed by Trump\u2019s warning of \u201cfire and fury\u201d. On Thursday, the US secretary of defense James Mattis, who was traveling in California, took questions from reporters about the president\u2019s ramping up of rhetoric over North Korea. Thinking in silence for a number of seconds before answering, he said: \u201cYou can see the American effort is diplomatically led. It has diplomatic traction, it is gaining diplomatic results.\u201d \u201cAnd I want to stay right there right now,\u201d he added. \u201cThe tragedy of war is well enough known. It doesn\u2019t need another characterisation beyond the fact that it would be catastrophic.\u201d However Gorka, the White House adviser, declined to tone down the harsh language, warning Pyongyang: \u201cDo not challenge the United States because you will pay a cost if you do so.\u201d Asked if the threat of a strike, rather than an actual attack, would be enough to provoke a response, Gorka told the BBC: \u201cIf you threaten a nation, then what should you expect: a stiffly worded letter to be sent by courier? Is that what the UK would do if a nation threatened a nuclear-tipped missile launched against any of the UK\u2019s territories?\u201d He also slapped down the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who had tried to be reassuring, saying: \u201cAmericans should sleep well at night.\u201d \u201cYou should listen to the president; the idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical,\u201d Gorka told the BBC. State department spokesperson Heather Nauert fired back at the criticism of her boss. \u201cHe\u2019s a cabinet secretary,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s the fourth in line to the presidency. He carries a big stick.\u201d She added: \u201cI think that everyone has clearly heard what Secretary Tillerson\u2019s forceful comments have been and continue to be.\u201d In the event of a missile launch by North Korea, the US military faces the dilemma of trying to intercept the incoming missiles and risking humiliation if it fails. Trump would have to decide whether to try to carry out a pre-emptive strike on the Hwasong launchpads or a retaliation strike if the launch went ahead. The North Korean military has frequently tested missiles that land in the sea off the Japanese coast, without a military response from Tokyo. Despite the harsh rhetoric, there was no change in US military deployments or alert status. The EU on Thursday expanded its sanctions regime to include nine new people and four organisations, including the state-owned Foreign Trade Bank, in response to North Korea\u2019s continued nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development. Those listed will be subject to EU asset freezes and travel restrictions, bringing Brussels in line with a UN resolution adopted last week. Earlier this week, the European commission said Pyongyang was in \u201coutright violation\u201d of international commitments, but a spokesman said the EU \u201cexcludes\u201d any military solution.",
