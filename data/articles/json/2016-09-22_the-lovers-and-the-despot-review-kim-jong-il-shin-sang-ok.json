    "content": "At last: one of the most staggeringly strange cases of Stockholm syndrome in history \u2013 and surely the weirdest story ever to have emerged from world cinema \u2013 now has been given the serious documentary treatment. In the 1950s and 60s, producer-director Shin Sang-ok was the titan of South Korean cinema, but by the 70s his career was flagging. In North Korea, the dysfunctional communist princeling Kim Jong-il was obsessed with movies and conceived the bizarre notion of jump-starting his nation\u2019s film industry by abducting Shin to work for him. This he did by instructing an agent to pose as a producer, luring Shin\u2019s ex-wife Choi Eun-hee to Hong Kong with the promise of a role, kidnapping her and taking her to North Korea. The reason? Bait. He calculated, correctly, that Shin would come looking for her in Hong Kong \u2013 where he too was abducted. (It begins to sound, bizarrely, like the plot of The Vanishing.) They were imprisoned separately but finally brought together by Kim, and in a grotesquely abusive situation compelled to remarry as the golden couple of North Korean cinema and for seven years allowed remarkable freedom to make western-style commercial films of the sort Kim yearned for. Eventually, they were allowed to visit European film festivals where they finally made their escape \u2013 but found they were widely disbelieved, precisely because of this apparently happy and productive professional renaissance. Their story here is riveting, although, as so often with this kind of material, I would like a clearer signpost as what has and has not been historically reconstructed.",
