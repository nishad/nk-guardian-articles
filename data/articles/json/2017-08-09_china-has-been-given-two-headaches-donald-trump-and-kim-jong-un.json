    "content": "For months the US\u2019s Twitter-happy commander-in-chief has battled to convince Beijing to join his crusade against Kim Jong-un \u2013 and on Saturday he seemed to finally make headway. After China backed a unanimous security council vote targeting Pyongyang, he bragged to his 35 million followers: Less than 72 hours later, however, and the mercurial US president looked to have repaid China\u2019s support by lobbing a verbal hand grenade on to its doorstep from the comfort of a New Jersey golf club. \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States [or] they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,\u201d Trump told reporters. The comments are likely to have enraged China\u2019s communist rulers as much as they delighted headline-writers. John Delury, a China and North Korea expert from Yonsei University in Seoul, said Pyongyang would relish Trump\u2019s incendiary remarks, which reinforced its claim to be under siege by the US. But China, which saw support for the latest UN sanctions as a big concession, would be less amused. \u201cTrump, after running a victory lap, now unleashes this verbal tirade, heightening all the tensions \u2026 It does not play well with Beijing,\u201d Delury said. Beijing responded to Trump\u2019s green-side declaration with a brief foreign ministry statement. It called on \u201call parties to avoid any words or actions that might escalate the situation\u201d and said \u201ceven greater efforts\u201d were now needed to solve the issue. But Shi Yinhong, a foreign policy adviser to China\u2019s cabinet-like state council, said Trump\u2019s \u201cextremely threatening words\u201d \u2013 which he believed also partly targeted China \u2013 would be a great disappointment to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who had been seeking to help his US counterpart. \u201c[Trump\u2019s] language is very provocative,\u201d said Shi, an international relations specialist at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s 30% serious and 70% rhetoric. But Kim Jong-un is a paranoid guy so this kind of language and threat might have some unfortunate effect [in terms of triggering] \u2026 some undesirable preemptive action.\u201d Since his inauguration in January, Trump has attempted to coax Xi into doing more to help him tackle what he has called \u201cthe menace of North Korea\u201d. \u201cNorth Korea is behaving very badly \u2026 China has done little to help!\u201d he wrote on Twitter in March. In April, Trump tweeted: Last month, following North Korea\u2019s first intercontinental ballistic missile test, Trump tweeted:\u201cPerhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!\u201d Trump has admitted he has refrained from challenging China over trade in order to secure its help and on the eve of Saturday\u2019s UN vote, US officials delayed the expected announcement of an investigation into alleged intellectual property abuses that some feared could spark a trade war. Shi said Xi had been trying to cooperate, pointing to China\u2019s support for the recent UN sanctions. Beijing had hoped such actions and the use of quiet diplomacy could help defuse the current crisis. \u201cBut Trump\u2019s statement goes in totally the opposite direction,\u201d Shi added, calling for Chinese moves to challenge the White House. \u201cChinese pressure has only been directed at North Korea. We should balance it and also put some pressure on the US because the danger is coming from both sides,\u201d Shi said. \u201cChina should issue a statement \u2013 just like it did a few years ago \u2013 saying: \u2018Anyone who wants to make fire and fury on China\u2019s doorstep will not be permitted [to do so].\u2019\u201d Delury said Trump\u2019s inflammatory proclamation would complicate his efforts to get China on board. \u201cWhat he literally did is he threatened war if North Korea continues to threaten the US \u2013 that\u2019s what is wild about this comment. That is not a good move if you are trying to keep the Chinese on your side because they give credence to the North Korean view that the reason for the nuclear deterrent in the first place is the American threat. And they would not see military action as being justified by any North Korean rhetoric. \u201cFrom a Chinese perspective, [Trump] is the one who has escalated.\u201d However, Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea specialist at Renmin University, said Beijing\u2019s ire would also be directed at Pyongyang. Cheng said Trump\u2019s anger at Kim Jong-un\u2019s \u201cutterly intolerable\u201d behaviour was understandable and believed China would be furious at North Korea\u2019s \u201cirrational and unwise\u201d provocations. \u201cPlaying with fire with a superpower can eventually get you burned,\u201d he warned. \u201cTrump has sent a clear message which carries weight: [that] the US is ready to use force \u2026 Trump\u2019s team has yet to be fully formed but he is surrounded \u2013 and greatly influenced by \u2013 generals \u2026 so if the US does resort to force in the end, he has a bunch of people who have been to war before.\u201d Cheng said China now needed to intensify its push for a diplomatic solution while also stepping up pressure on Pyongyang. \u201cI\u2019m quite certain that the soft approach towards North Korea has failed.\u201d The crisis represents a severe headache for Xi, who is gearing up for two crucial and politically sensitive events in the second half of this year. Before the year is out Trump is expected to visit China, amid warnings that ties between the world\u2019s top two economies have reached a historic \u201cpivot point\u201d. This autumn Beijing hosts a key Communist party summit marking the end of Xi\u2019s first five-year term, at which he hopes to tighten his grip on power by installing loyalists in key positions. Shi said China\u2019s leader needed to push back against Trump, despite concerns about the \u201cnegative impact\u201d the Korean crisis might have on preparations for the congress. \u201cIf there is a military conflict this will have a big, big negative impact.\u201d Additional reporting by Wang Zhen",
