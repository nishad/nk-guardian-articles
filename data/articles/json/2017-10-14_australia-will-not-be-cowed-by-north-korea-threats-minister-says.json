    "content": "North Korea has issued its latest threat against Australia for its relationship with the US and South Korea, but a Turnbull government minister said the nation would \u201cnot be cowed\u201d by the rogue state. North Korean state media reported Australia was \u201cshowing dangerous moves of zealously joining the frenzied political and military provocations of the US against DPRK\u201d, warning against it. \u201cShould Australia continue to follow the US in imposing military, economic and diplomatic pressure upon the DPRK despite our repeated warnings, they will not be able to avoid a disaster,\u201d the state-run news agency KCNA said in a statement on Saturday. North Korea\u2019s latest round of warnings against Australia came in the wake of foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop and defence minister Marise Payne\u2019s visit last week to the demilitarized zone which sits between South and North Korea. Bishop and Payne attended meetings in the truce village of Panmunjom with their South Korean counterparts, reinforcing Australia\u2019s support for its historical ally. Speaking in Sydney on Sunday, Bishop brushed off North Korea\u2019s latest statement on Australia. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s threats only strengthen our resolve to find a peaceful solution to the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula caused entirely by North Korea\u2019s illegal, threatening and provocative behaviour,\u201d she said. The minister for defence personnel, Dan Tehan, said Australia would not be bullied by North Korea. \u201cWe will not be cowed by the North Koreans, we will continue to do all we can to protect and help and support our allies,\u201d he told Sky News on Sunday. \u201cThe North Koreans should do what the international community have asked them to do \u2013 obey all the security council resolutions which have been passed, condemning their missile activity, condemning their attempts to build nuclear weapons. \u201cIf they did that, the international community would look to work with them. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, then we will continue to support our allies, the South Koreans, the Japanese and everyone else who is threatened by this unpalatable behaviour by the North Koreans.\u201d Labor foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, who made a recent visit to the region with Bill Shorten to reassure South Korea of Australia\u2019s bipartisan position on the issue, reiterated the opposition\u2019s support. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we continue to stand with the international community, that we continue to seek a unified approach and a peaceful diplomatic solution,\u201d she told radio station 2GB. \u201cIt is not the time for escalatory language and the opposition supports the comments that the foreign minister made in her recent visit to the Korean peninsula where she sought a diplomatic and peaceful solution to this crisis.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Pyongyang has taken aim at Australia. In April, KCNA issued a statement Australia was risking a \u201csuicidal act\u201d if it continued to support the US in United Nations security council resolutions. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has repeatedly confirmed Australia would come to the aid of the United States if the Anzus treaty was enacted, while also calling on China to do more to use its influence to bring North Korea back in line. The latest Guardian Essential poll found 55 % of Australians feared the North Korean standoff would lead to war. With Australian Associated Press",
