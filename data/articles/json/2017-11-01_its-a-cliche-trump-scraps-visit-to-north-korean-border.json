    "content": "Donald Trump will not visit the heavily armed border dividing the Korean peninsula during his tour of Asia next week \u2013 breaking with an American presidential tradition intended to demonstrate Washington\u2019s commitment to its South Korean allies by standing on the North Korean frontier. A senior US administration official said Trump, who begins his 12-day visit in Japan on Sunday, would be too busy for a trip to the demilitarised zone (DMZ). \u201cThe president is not going to visit the DMZ, there is not enough time in the schedule,\u201d the official said. The defence secretary, James Mattis, visited the area last week and Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, went in March. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a little bit of a clich\u00e9, frankly,\u201d the official said. Trump\u2019s presence near the demarcation line that passes through the centre of the 2.5-mile wide, 155-mile-long strip of land would have carried particular significance at a time when regional tensions are high over Pyongyang\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes. Instead he will meet US military personnel and their families at Camp Humphreys, about 90km south of Seoul. The base was recently expanded and now serves as the new headquarters of the US 8th Army, the cornerstone of the US military presence in South Korea. \u201cNo president has visited Camp Humphreys and we thought that that made more sense in terms of its messaging, in terms of the chance to address families and troops there,\u201d the official said. He added that by going to Camp Humphreys, Trump would be demonstrating Washington\u2019s commitment to its alliance with the South. \u201cThe South Korean government paid the vast majority of the costs for building that base and repositioning some of the US forces and their families on the peninsula,\u201d he said. The DMZ has kept the two countries apart since the Korean war ended 64 years ago with an armistice but not a peace treaty. It has been on every visiting president\u2019s itinerary, with the exception of George W Bush, since Ronald Reagan went in 1983. Bill Clinton famously described it as \u201cthe scariest place on Earth\u201d when he visited in 1993. In 2012 Barack Obama told troops stationed there that \u201cthe contrast between South Korea and North Korea could not be clearer, could not be starker, both in terms of freedom but also in terms of prosperity.\u201d The US official pointed out that Mike Pence, the vice-president, had been to the DMZ earlier this year. Dressed in a leather bomber jacket, Pence challenged the North Koreans to \u201csee our resolve in my face\u201d while a guard photographed him from the northern side of the border. Trump is due to hold talks with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, and will urge the international community to \u201cmaximise pressure\u201d on Pyongyang in a speech to the national assembly during his two-day stay in South Korea.",
