    "content": "As the world\u2019s diplomats prepare for a long night of speeches, we\u2019re going to wrap things up for today. The highlights from today\u2019s morning session: \u2022 UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who took over the international body\u2019s top job in January, began the day by lamenting divisive political discourse and appealing for calmer rhetoric. \u2022 Minutes later, Donald Trump, the second world leader to address the assembly, threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea. \u2022 In a speech that lasted for just over 40 minutes, the US president, who was making his debut speech to the general assembly, railed against the countries he sees as enemies to the US, primarily North Korea and Iran. He did not mention climate change, which is one of the top issues being discussed at this week\u2019s meeting. \u2022 Other leaders, including French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the president of the Switzerland confederation, Doris Leuthard, made critical allusions to Trump\u2019s style of politics. \u201cIt\u2019s not walls that protect us, it\u2019s our desire to act,\u201d Macron said. \u2022 The morning session concluded with a strong show of support for Trump from Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu, who complimented the president for taking a strong stance against the Iran deal and being welcoming to Israel. \u2022 Netanyahu also said: \u201cAfter 70 years, the world is embracing Israel and Israel is embracing the world\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger is reporting live from the winding halls of the United Nations headquarters in New York all week, and you can follow him here. For better or for worse, it now appears that on the question of Iran \u2013 a long term obsession of Netanyahu \u2013 Trump and the Israeli prime minister are completely joined at the hip. For the Israeli prime minister, that certainly helps reinforce his standing on the domestic front, but how much it will help him in persuading other members of the international community, especially co-signatories of the Iran nuclear deal who still support it, is more questionable. The optics in the region of a US president delivering a speech that could have been written by the Israeli embassy, and Netanyahu\u2019s celebration of that speech, may have unanticipated consequences. Israel may also regret associating itself in the future so closely with such a bellicose and contradictory speech by Trump. Some similarities were striking with both Trump and Netanyahu make common cause with the Iranian people against the regime in Tehran giving an impression at least \u2013 whether true or not \u2013 that the speeches were in some way coordinated. Indeed this was a risk that was warned against by Israeli columnist Chemi Chalev ahead of Netanyahu\u2019s speech, referring explicitly to the suspicion that Israel helped push George W Bush to a war against Iraq. Israel needed many long years to refute the allegation that, together with its neo-conservative lackeys in Washington, it pushed George W. Bush into the war with Iraq, and this at a time when, unlike Netanyahu, then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon maintained a low public profile. If there is a sudden and serious deterioration in relations between Washington and Tehran over the next few weeks, Israel will be hard-pressed to deny that this is what it wanted to achieve all along. When things get complicated, as they always do, it will be easy to point an accusatory finger at Netanyahu and his country. This brings an end to the morning session, two hours and 20 minutes after it was scheduled to end. This means no two-hour lunch break for the delegates \u2013 the afternoon meeting has already been called to order and the president of Mali is taking his turn at the podium. Netanyahu speaks again of his gratitude towards Trump for recognizing Israel and condemning the Iran nuclear deal. He says no speech \u201cwas bolder, none were more courageous and forthright as the one delivered by President Trump.\u201d He says if the Iran nuclear deal remains, it will result in a situation similar to the one the world is currently facing with North Korea. He says an \u201cIranian curtain\u201d has descended across the Middle East. He says he has a simple message for Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: \u201cthe light of Israel will never be extinguished\u201d. He continues: \u201cThose who threaten us with annihilation put ourselves in mortal peril\u201d. But, Netanyahu says, Israel is a friend to the people of Iran. He delivers the message in Farsi as well. He then lists some of the acts the Iranian government perpetrated against its people recently, including the jailing of journalists and the execution of gay men last year. Netanyahu then brings the speech back to where it began: a celebration of Israel innovation, noting how its technologies and people have helped people around the world. Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu begins by speaking about how his country is an \u201cinnovation nation\u201d in water, autonomous vehicles, agriculture and technology. In almost the same breath, he says Israel is also very strong on collecting intelligence about terrorism. He says the general public might not know this, but our country\u2019s intelligence agencies do. He commends Trump for visiting Israel on his first foreign trip as president, then recounts his own trips around the world in the past year, including Australia, Asia, South America and Europe. \u201cAfter 70 years, the world is embracing Israel and Israel is embracing the world,\u201d he says, garnering a round of applause from the audience. He makes a joke about wanting to go to Antarctica to see penguins, who he calls supporters of Israel. In response to the ensuing laughter, he says the audience might think it\u2019s a joke, but penguins understand Israel\u2019s conflict with Palestine is a \u201cblack and white issue\u201d. Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan says global stability has reduced since last year\u2019s general assembly. He says Turkey is anxiously watching the development of anti-Muslim sentiment and xenophobia. \u201cWe all have to shoulder responsibility for a safer and more prosperous world,\u201d Erdo\u011fan says. He says Turkey has not received adequate assistance, particularly from the European Union, to provide aid to refugees in the country. He calls the issue with Palestine \u201cthe gaping whole of the world\u201d and encouraged Israel to work toward a two-state solution. He refers to the attacks on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar as \u201calmost ethnic cleansing\u201d. He said if what\u2019s happening there is not stopped, it will leave a \u201cdark stain\u201d on humanity. Erdo\u011fan ends by saying regardless of our skin color \u201cour tears are the same\u201d. He urges the group to take action to end \u201cthe tears in the world\u201d. Iran\u2019s foreign minister responded to Trump\u2019s general assembly address on Twitter. The Guardian\u2019s Washington DC bureau chief, David Smith, has helpfully annotated Trump\u2019s remarks to the general assembly this morning. The word \u2018sovereign\u2019 is used 21 times. As Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to deliver his speech, the country\u2019s left-leaning daily Haaretz has posted a video compilation of the greatest hits of the corny stunts and props that Netanyahu has used in his speeches in recent years including the cartoon bomb supposed to show Iran\u2019s progress in its nuclear programme and the somewhat bizarre \u2018silent treatment\u2019 he subjected the UN general assembly too. The Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis, is watching Macron\u2019s press conference at the United Nations. Now on stage: Qatar\u2019s Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Than. There are two more people scheduled to speak after him, then the morning session will conclude. It was scheduled to conclude at 1pm. Up next: Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan Israel Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Lithuania\u2019s president Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 is speaking before the general assembly. She talks about Russia\u2019s role in spreading \u201cfake news\u201d and says aggression is not a strong diplomatic tool. \u201cBullies are weak because they are insecure,\u201d she says. She continues: \u201cAggression can never make anyone stronger, it can never earn anyone a drop of respect\u201d. She ends by saying \u201cwe cannot let fear win\u201d. Trump has doubled-down on his earlier threat to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea in a tweet. Colombia\u2019s president Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n also speaks passionately in favor of the United Nations. He says Colombia is concerned about Venezuela, its neighboring country. Venezuela \u201cpains us,\u201d he says. He calls on the international community to lend support to the people of Venezuela in the search for a \u201cpeaceful solution\u201d. He speaks about how his country melts down weapons and says, as a recipient of the Nobel Peace prize, he believes we should all be working together. \u201cWe human being are one, what affects one of us affects all of us,\u201d he says. He concludes by speaking about an issue he says he can\u2019t ignore, the war on drugs. He says drug policies should emphasize decriminalization \u201cIt is time to accept while there is consumption, there will be supply,\u201d he says. It is his last speech to the general assembly. \u201cWith the strength of love, we can overcome fear,\u201d he says. Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister Jorge Arreaza has responded to Trump\u2019s speech. We do not accept threats from President Trump or whoever in this world. We are people of peace, peaceful people and we want relations of mutual respect. This racist and supremacist theory which he\u2019s exposing, this return to the Cold War, for a moment we didn\u2019t know if we were listening to President Reagan in 1982 or President Trump in 2017 Macron mentions \u201cmultilateralism\u201d multiple times in his remarks \u2013 a clear rebuke to Trump \u2013 then explains at-length why he believes it is so important to the world order. He says multilateralism is needed to improve functions at the UN so countries can better coordinate crisis management. He returns to the thread about the UN giving world leaders an opportunity to provide a voice for the voiceless. \u201cThe safety of all of us is also our safety,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir lives are our lives\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not walls that protect us, it\u2019s our desire to act,\u201d he says. Another Trump critique. \u201cWe cannot have on the one hand, one camp that is multilateral and another camp that is unilateral in its approach,\u201d he says, calling again for multilateralism. At the end of his speech, he is met with enthusiastic applause. Macron says North Korea poses \u201can existential threat\u201d and that it\u2019s all the countries responsibilities, including China and Russia, to bring North Korea to the negotiation table. He pivots from North Korea to Iran, advocating in favor of the existing Iran nuclear deal. \u201cThis is a good agreement, an agreement that\u2019s essential to peace\u201d he says, at a time when there is potential for a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d. Macron says this is a message he has been sharing with the delegations from the US and Iran. More on that, by Julian Borger, here: \u201cWhen I hear our colleagues talk about the world that exists today they forget about the world behind us,\u201d says France\u2019s president Emmanuel Macron. He talks about advocating for people who do not have a voice and throughout the speech quotes refugees from conflict zones including Libya and Syria \u2013 as well as victims of natural disasters tied to climate change. Macron says France is opposed to chemical weapons in Syria and will continue its fight against terrorism there. He repeatedly emphasizes that these issues cannot be resolved solely with a military response \u2013 he says a political response is needed too. Macron also denounces the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. He says France remains committed to the Paris climate agreement and that the country will be introducing an environment measure at the UN today. Again, he says world leaders should be looking forward instead of to the past. He\u2019s been speaking for more than 22 minutes. The presidents of four countries have just spoken in favor of working together to end conflict and strife and warned of threats facing their countries and the world. Slovakia\u2019s president Andrej Kiska spoke about the importance of working together to address crises like famine and conflict and putting aside \u201cegoism\u201d in responding to the world\u2019s problems. \u201cNorth Korea openly threatens our world with nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch disrespect to human life cannot be tolerated\u201d. He stepped down and was replaced by Nigeria\u2019s president Muhammadu Buhari, who talked about the threats of Isis and Boko Haram. He called for the empowerment of women and free and fair elections. \u201cOur faith in democracy remains firm and unshaken,\u201d Buhari said. The Czech Republic\u2019s president Milo\u0161 Zeman ended his speech with a quote: \u201cIf I knew there would be doomsday tomorrow I would go today and plant my apple tree\u201d. It is a reference to a quote attributed to Martin Luther, that may have actually originated with church members opposed to Nazi rule in Germany. And Liberia\u2019s president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf just ended her speech. She is the first female president of Africa and highlighted the progress the country has made during her rule. Sirleaf has announced she will step down and the election for her successor is next month. \u201cLiberia is your post-conflict success story,\u201d she said. On Twitter, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders just highlighted a quote by Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama. People quickly responded to Sanders with the next line of Obama\u2019s quote: \u201cBut aside from the humanitarian costs of that, they are right next door to our vital ally, Republic of Korea\u201d. The second line highlights the impact a war with North Korea could have on South Korea, whose capital city of Seoul is just 35 miles south of the demilitarized zone, the heavily armed border between the north and the south. There are 10 million people in Seoul and 28,500 US troops in South Korea. Trump\u2019s remarks were delivered around midnight in the Korean peninsula. Our Jerusalem correspondent, Peter Beaumont, has reaction to Trump\u2019s speech from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He says Netanyahu \u201ccould have written the section on Iran so closely does it ally with his own views on the threat posed by Tehran\u201d. Praising Trump, ahead of his own speech later this afternoon, Netanyahu said: In my more than 30 years at the UN, I have never heard such a brave and clear speech. President Trump told the truth about the world\u2019s lurking dangers, and called for them to be addressed with fortitude, to ensure the future of humanity. The president of the Switzerland confederation, Doris Leuthard, opens by speaking about the world\u2019s greatest challenges, like famine, and says that \u201cno one country\u201d can solve these issues on their own. \u201cThe purpose of the UN is to maintain international peace and security,\u201d she says, taking a moment to speak in English, though most of her address is in French. She makes a clear allusion to Trump, saying that country\u2019s cannot solve the world\u2019s issues on their own and that she is a patriot, which is why she believes in a strong UN. She then continues her address in French, touching on the need to reduce sexual exploitation (an effort which Switzerland is contributing funds to the UN to end), and to help resolve the conflict in Libya. \u201cTo each his own\u201d is not a viable way of responding to global issues, says Leuthard, concluding her speech. A reminder: Switzerland has no head of state, but instead a committee of seven elected leaders, known as the Federal Council. Cond\u00e9 also speaks about terrorism, saying it can only be eradicated if poverty ends. He advocates for a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestine conflict. He reaffirms the republic\u2019s support of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. \u201cAfrican young people and women are determined to write a new page in the history of humanity,\u201d he says, asking for the UN to help make that happen. He ends the speech with a call of support for the Paris climate deal and a request for increased international aid to Sierra Leone. Switzerland is next. After a five-minute break, the group has reassembled. Now up, Guinea\u2019s president, Alpha Cond\u00e9. \u201cThe fact Africa is lagging behind will not always be the case,\u201d he says. He calls for diversified economies in Africa through investment in energy, infrastructure and agriculture. He says Africans \u201cyearn for prosperity,\u201d especially the country\u2019s youth. \u201cAfrica has decide to take responsibility for itself and to speak henceforth with one voice,\u201d he says, speaking at length about the impact of the African Union. He says the UN security council \u201cno longer reflects current realities\u201d and bemoans the lack of significant African representation on the council. He calls for an enlargement of the council to include African representatives selected by the African Union. While Trump\u2019s speech touched on myriad topics including migration, terrorism and the threatened destruction of North Korea, but speech-watchers note he missed several other key topics swirling at this year\u2019s UN general assembly. Trump speaks about the US middle class, saying they will be \u201cforgotten no more\u201d. He heralds the importance of patriotism, again emphasizing that countries can only resolve global conflict if they protect themselves and their interests first. \u201cNow we are calling for a great reawakening of nations,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself,\u201d he says. Trump thanks the audience and concludes, after about 41 minutes and 20 seconds, by saying: \u201cGod bless you, God bless the nations of the world, and God bless the United states of America\u201d. Trump briefly winds down his speech to speak about the need to empower \u201cwomen entrepreneurs,\u201d earning applause, before becoming angry again to talk about the US contributions to the UN. He says the US carries an \u201cunfair burden\u201d with the resources it provides to the UN. Trump then attacks Cuba and the government of Venezuela. He says people need to do more to address the situation there. He begins the 34th minute of his speech with a critique of communism. Trump\u2019s speaks loudly again as he discusses the threat of international terrorism. He says the US is working with its allies in the Middle East to \u201ccrush\u201d terrorists. \u201cOur country has achieved more against Isis in the last eight months,\u201d says Trump, then it has in the years before combined. It\u2019s unclear what measure he is using for achievement. He thanks Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for hosting refugees. \u201cThe United States is a compassionate nation,\u201d he says, before launching into a defense of his government\u2019s efforts to reduce the refugee cap in the US. \u201cRocket Man is on a suicide mission for him and his regime,\u201d says Trump, referring to Kim Jong-Un. He continues to say he hopes we don\u2019t have to destroy North Korea. He has moved on to Iran, saying the nuclear deal is \u201can embarrassment to the United States\u201d. Trump has been speaking for more than 20 minutes. He says the member states must work together to confront \u201crogue regimes\u201d. \u201cIf the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph,\u201d he says 14 minutes into the speech, Trump mentions North Korea, speaking about the death of American student Otto Warmbier after being detained by the North Korean government. He says the \u201centire world\u201d is threatened by the nuclear threat in North Korea. \u201cIf it [the US] forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,\u201d Trump says. Trump says the United States will no longer be taken advantage of in deals it makes with other countries. \u201cOur citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom,\u201d he says. They have also fought to defend other countries represented in the room, he says. \u201cIt is an eternal credit to the American character,\u201d that we have fought wars abroad but have not \u201csought territorial expansion\u201d and not imposed our way of life on other people. \u201cWe want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife,\u201d he says. Trump speaks about protecting the rights given by God, emphasizing the word \u201cGod\u201d and pausing before he continues. \u201cIn America, we do not seek to impose our life on anyone,\u201d he says but the US wants to shine as an example. He says he was elected to give power to the people \u201cwhere it belongs\u201d. \u201cAs president of the United States\u201d he will always put America first, he says. He gets louder, saying that\u2019s what all countries should do. He gets some claps for that remark. Trump talks about citizens needing to be able to achieve their dreams and for children to be able to live in a world without hate. \u201cThe success of the United Nations depends on the independent strength of its members,\u201d he says. He acknowledges that all countries have different goals, but the \u201cbeautiful vision\u201d that led to the creation of the UN allows people to work side-by-side. Trump has criticized the UN repeatedly in the past. Trump highlights breakthroughs in technology and medicine. Then says every day is filled with new threats. \u201cRogue regimes\u201d support terrorists and threaten other countries. \u201cAuthority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse\u201d systems and alliances that \u201ctiled the war toward freedom\u201d after the second world war, he says. \u201cWe meet at a time of both immense promise and great peril,\u201d he says. Saying it\u2019s up to \u201cus\u201d whether the world \u201cis lifted to new heights\u201d or \u201ca valley of disrepair\u201d. US president Donald Trump is making his debut speech to the general assembly, saying it is a \u201cprofound honor\u201d to represent the American people from his home city. He expresses thanks to all the world leaders who have offered help and condolences in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Thankfully, he says, the US is doing well. The economy is at an \u201call-time high\u201d. He says the country is experiencing job growth like it has not seen \u201cin a very long time\u201d. \u201cOur military will soon be the strongest it has ever been,\u201d he says. Temer speaks about international terrorism and organized crime. He speaks about the need for countries to commit to human rights. \u201cWe reject racism,\u201d Temer says. \u201cWe reject xenophobia in all its forms\u201d. He expresses concern about the crisis in Venezuela and says Brazil stands with the people of Venezuela. \u201cThere is no more room for alternatives to democracy,\u201d he says. Temer has just wrapped up, which means Trump is next on stage. Brazil\u2019s president Michel Temer is now addressing the general assembly. \u201cToday we certainly need the UN more than before, and I\u2019m talking about a UN that is increasingly effective,\u201d he says. But, reform is still needed, Temer says. He wants the security council expanded. He says protectionist countries threaten progress and development. \u201cWe reject exacerbated forms of nationalism,\u201d Temer says. He expresses support for the Paris climate agreement and says Brazil is at the forefront with its \u201clow-carbon economy\u201d. He touts a reduction in deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Temer advocates for nuclear disarmament, saying Brazil has shown it could master nuclear weapons, but chooses not to have them. Laj\u010d\u00e1k speaks about migration, which he acknowledges is a \u201cdivisive issue\u201d and says another UN priority should be addressing international terrorism. \u201cThe only way to succeed in both areas will be through choosing to focus on people, rather than rigidly sticking to our individual positions,\u201d Laj\u010d\u00e1k says. \u201cWe need viable global frameworks, which can be implemented by people \u2013 and for people \u2013 in real time\u201d. He says the UN member states must adhere to the Paris climate agreement and work to protect human rights. He highlights the need for women\u2019s leadership and rights as well as reform in the UN, which \u201cshould be opening its doors wider,\u201d he says. \u201cWe must strengthen our engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders, including regional and sub-regional organizations, civil society and the private sector,\u201d Laj\u010d\u00e1k says. \u201cWe need to hear more young voices in this Hall\u201d. The president of the72nd session of the general assembly, Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k is on stage. He begins by offering his condolences for the people of Dominica, which was devastated by a category 5 hurricane overnight. Laj\u010d\u00e1k says his priorities are climate change, migration and inequality. He speaks about the UN\u2019s role in addressing global conflict. \u201cUnfortunately, we are spending too much time and money reacting to conflicts, not preventing them,\u201d Laj\u010d\u00e1k says. The UN has the tools it needs to prevent conflict, Laj\u010d\u00e1k says, but \u201cwhat we are missing are the conditions in which they can be properly used\u201d. \u201cRefugees, internally displaced persons and migrants are not the problem; the problem lies in conflict, persecution and hopeless poverty,\u201d says Guterres. \u201cInstead of closed doors and open hostility, we need to reestablish the integrity of the refugee protection regime and the simple decency of human compassion\u201d. He thanks the audience. Guterres is now speaking at length about \u201chuman mobility\u201d. \u201cLet us be clear: we do not only face a refugee crisis, we also face a crisis of solidarity,\u201d he says. He says every country has the right to protect its borders, but warns some countries are not being as friendly as they should be. \u201cI commend those countries that have shown hospitality for millions of displaced people,\u201d Guterres says. The line receives a round of applause from the room. \u201cMigration should be an option, not a necessity,\u201d he says. He says tragedies in the Mediterranean will not end with more strict migration policies. \u201cSafe migration cannot be reserved for the global elite,\u201d Guterres says. That line gets more fervent clapping. \u201cNo one is winning today\u2019s wars,\u201d says Guterres, listing crises in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan and Afghanistan. He advocates for specific responses to conflicts including the violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. He says the country\u2019s government must provide \u201cunhindered humanitarian access\u201d. Guterres also endorses the two-state solution in Israel and Palestine, saying it \u201cis the only way forward\u201d. He highlights the threat of climate change, pointing to the devastating hurricanes in the Caribbean and US this month. The first priority Guterres lists is nuclear weapons. He cites North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile tests: \u201cI condemn those test unequivocally.\u201d Guterres warns that the world \u201cmust not sleepwalk our way into war\u201d. Aside from the threat from North Korea, Guterres said all countries must \u201cshow a greater commitment to a world without nuclear weapons\u201d. The second priority he lists is terrorism. To confront this, nation\u2019s must also address the underlying issues that cause people to radicalize, whether the perceived injustices of potential terrorists are real or not, Guterres said. United Nations secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is addressing the general assembly. \u201cOur world is in trouble, people are hurting and angry,\u201d said Guterres. He explains that the world\u2019s population is most concerned with inequality and climate change. \u201cSocieties are fragmented, political discourse is polarized,\u201d he says, continuing to highlight how divided society appears. \u201cWe are a world in pieces, we need to be a world at peace,\u201d Guterres said. He is now outlining seven priorities for this UN general assembly. The general debate is being called to order. You can watch the UN\u2019s live stream here. A reminder of the general debate rules: each nation\u2019s representative is given 15 minutes to speak, though the lure of the international stage inspires many to extend their speeches beyond that allotment. The record for longest speech goes to Cuba\u2019s former president Fidel Castro, who in 1960 held the podium for four hours and 29 minutes. So, while the morning session is scheduled to conclude at 1pm ET for a lunch break, it\u2019s safe to assume that it will extend past that hour. The theme of this year\u2019s general debate is: \u201cFocusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet\u201d. The schedule for the morning session: United Nations Secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres President of the72nd session of the general assembly, Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k Brazil President Michel Temer US President Donald Trump Guinea President Alpha Cond\u00e9 Switzerland President Doris Leuthard Slovakia President Andrej Kiska Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari Czech Republic President Milo\u0161 Zeman France President Emmanuel Macron Liberia President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf Colombia President Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon Zambia President Edgar Chagwa Lungu Lithuania President Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 Qatar Amir Sheikh Tamim b in Hamad Al - Than Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan Israel Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Welcome to our live coverage of the United Nations general assembly\u2019s general debate, where world leaders will present their priorities to the international stage. The session will open at about 9am local time in New York (2pm in London) with remarks by secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who is hosting his first general assembly since taking up the UN\u2019s top post in January. As is customary, Brazil will be the first country to speak, followed immediately by US president Donald Trump, who has in the past called the UN \u201ca club for people to get together, talk and have a good time\u201d. He is expected to warn member states that they risk being \u201cbystanders in history\u201d if they do not mobilize to confront the threats of Iran and North Korea. The morning session will continue with 15 other countries, including France, whose president Emmanuel Macron is also making his UNGA debut, but is expected to pitch a very different worldview than Trump. The French delegation is warning the US this week that quitting the Iran nuclear deal risks \u201cspiraling proliferation\u201d. We\u2019ll have live updates of today\u2019s speeches here, with analysis from the Guardian\u2019s team of experts, including world affairs editor, Julian Borger, who is reporting from the UN\u2019s New York headquarters. As we wait for Guterres to take the stage, you can read Julian\u2019s dispatches from yesterday\u2019s UN meetings here: Trump to UN: confront North Korea and Iran or risk being \u2018bystanders in history\u2019 France tells Trump that quitting Iran nuclear deal risks \u2018spiral of proliferation\u2019",
