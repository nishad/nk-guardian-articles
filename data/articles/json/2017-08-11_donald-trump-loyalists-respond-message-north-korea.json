    "content": "In the escalating war of words between Washington and Pyongyang, everyone in Donald Trump\u2019s White House appears to have an opinion \u2013 even the president\u2019s lawyer. Trump, eager to amplify his strongman image, this week threatened to respond to North Korean aggression with \u201cfire and fury\u201d after the isolated state successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that appears to have the range to strike the continental US. As the relevant members of Trump\u2019s cabinet sprang to action to parse and clarify the president\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric, so too did his most ardent loyalists, who were all too eager to amplify their boss\u2019s message. Sebastian Gorka Gorka, a fringe figure on the right with questionable foreign policy and security credentials who now serves as deputy assistant to the president, harbors anti-Islamic views and has been linked to Hungarian far-right groups. Despite his lack of a security clearance, Gorka has served as a prominent Trump surrogate on cable news, where he blithely defends Trump against every charge and criticism. On Thursday, Gorka was forced to walk back comments that implied the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was speaking out of turn when he assured Americans that nuclear war with North Korea is not an \u201cimminent threat\u201d. \u201cAmericans should sleep well at night. I have no concerns about this particular rhetoric over the last few days,\u201d Tillerson said. In an interview with the BBC radio on Thursday, Gorka said Trump\u2019s warning was not bluster \u2013 it was a serious threat. \u201cYou should listen to the president \u2013 the idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical,\u201d Gorka said, according to recording of the interview obtained by the Washington Post. Gorka continued: \u201cIt is the job of Secretary Mattis, the secretary of defense, to talk about the military options, and he has done so unequivocally. He said, \u2018Woe betide anyone who militarily challenges the United States,\u2019 and that is his portfolio. That is his mandate. Secretary Tillerson is the chief diplomat of the United States, and it is his portfolio to handle those issues.\u201d He later blamed reporters for misconstruing his comments about the \u201camazing Rex Tillerson\u201d and dismissed the reporting as a \u201cclassic example\u201d of \u201cfake news\u201d. \u201cI was admonishing the journalists of the fake news industrial complex who are forcing our chief diplomat into a position where they are demanding he makes the military case for action when that is not the mandate of the secretary of state,\u201d Gorka said on Fox News. Earlier in the week, Gorka appeared on Fox News to expound on America\u2019s military might, hyperbolic describing the nation as no longer a \u201csuperpower\u201d but a \u201chyper-power\u201d. \u201cWe are now a hyper-power. Nobody in the world, especially not North Korea, comes close to challenging our military capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether they are conventional, whether they are nuclear or whether they are special forces. The message is very clear: don\u2019t test this White House, Pyongyang.\u201d Gorka said criticism of the president during a time of difficulty \u201csaddens me\u201d and compared the situation to the Cuban missile crisis, which is remembered as the closest the world has ever come to nuclear war. \u201cWe need to come together,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cAnybody, whether a member of Congress or a journalist, who thinks politics trumps the national security of America, that\u2019s an indictment of you. You need to ask yourself: what\u2019s more important? My political party or America. There\u2019s only one correct answer to that.\u201d Stephen Miller Miller, the 31-year-old White House senior policy adviser, played a key role in the roll-out of the controversial travel ban that barred visitors from Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the US. Miller is closely aligned with Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist and the former executive editor of the pro-Trump Breitbart News; together the pair occupy the nativist wing of the White House. In an interview with Nigel Farage, a former British politician and the architect of Brexit, Miller praised \u201cthe frankness of the president\u2019s comments, the straightforwardness of his comments broadcast publicly, about his expectations in that area, again\u201d. Miller went on to tie Trump\u2019s North Korea strategy with his rejection of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. \u201cThe president inherited years of a failed strategy on North Korea and we are living through the results now, and so by definition, you have to change your strategic approach,\u201d he said. \u201cOur approach to engagement with the world has to be completely rethought and that\u2019s what this president campaigned on, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Jay Sekulow Sekulow, part of the legal team representing the president amid investigations into possible ties between his campaign and Russia, is a vocal defender of the president. Not known for his foreign policy expertise, Sekulow nonetheless weighed in on the situation in North Korea during his daily show, broadcast by American Center for Legal Justice, his Christian nonprofit which is being examined by authorities after the Guardian reported that it had steered tens of millions of dollars to the attorney, his family and their businesses.",
