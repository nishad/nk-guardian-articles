    "content": "The Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un circus has been a bit like an episode of The Secret Life of 5 Year Olds. There\u2019s been name-calling (Kim\u2019s a \u201clittle rocket man\u201d; Trump\u2019s an \u201cold lunatic\u201d) and size comparisons (\u201cI too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his!\u201d). And as the playground antics rolled on, it seemed the summit might need some kind of school guidance counsellor present, to break up any hair- (/wig-)pulling and wipe snot and tears. I\u2019d heard weeks of people bemoaning the fact that Trump and Kim would likely stick to the status quo, neither budging on anything. And then it hit me. Pre-summit, what these guys really need is a night in together watching High School Musical, the film that teaches teens to behave like decent humans, and whose central number, Stick to the Status Quo, sees members of rival cliques bonding as they shrug off their labels. It was bound to happen one day \u2013 Zac Efron could save us all from a nuclear winter. Sharing is caring Stick to the Status Quo is all about revealing the real you. Bonding over being vulnerable. Maybe even finding a common interest. There\u2019s a nerd who shares her secret love of hip-hop, a jock who bakes. How much more malleable might Kim feel on learning that Trump isn\u2019t just a bigoted, perma-tanned toddler; he also loves remote-control cars? How glorious to hear the leaders\u2019 aides chorus, \u201cSpeak your mind/And you\u2019ll be heeeeaaard!\u201d and an inspired Kim proclaim, \u201cI love to sew! Handkerchiefs, tote bags, even these wide-legged suit trousers!\u201d If you\u2019re going to use cheerleaders as a political tool, get some good ones I\u2019m not sure who misunderstood the purpose of cheerleaders more. Trump, who almost silenced his own rally with those creepy, terrorist-threatening tweens: \u201cCome on, boys, take \u2019em down!\u201d Or Kim, with his grinning army at the 2018 Winter Olympics. But both should look to the East High Wildcats\u2019 pompom shakers to learn the basic attribute of a good cheerleader: they need to make you look better, not more insane. Huffs are a good thing Trump threw a strop and cancelled the summit, although he\u2019s now declared the pair are \u201cover that. Totally over that.\u201d But the public may be reassured to learn that flouncing off is actually an HSM cornerstone. It\u2019s the Big Flounce (usually performed by one of the films\u2019 leads, Troy or Gabriella) that sparks the Realisation (of the fact that musical theatre/friends/each other are more important than college/earning money for college/meeting future employers). That in turn leads inevitably to the Reunion, where the gang becomes even closer. So although Kim may have momentarily felt like Gabriella when she sings, \u201cWhenever we try, somehow the plan/Is always rearranged\u201d, Trump has actually increased this summit\u2019s chances of success. There\u2019s wisdom to be found on a golf course Of all the Big Flounces, the most flouncy of all is in HSM2 when Troy\u2019s friends shun him for working towards his own future. So he storms around a golf course singing Bet on It, a song about getting back to who you really are. Well, if golf courses are where narcissists go to re-centre, we\u2019re sorted. Trump\u2019s got the greens and Kim has golfing in his blood, what with his dad\u2019s miraculous holes-in-one. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t be golfing. They\u2019d be strutting, jazz-handing, and throwing bunker sand aloft while singing profundities like, \u201cGotta work on my swing/Gotta do my own thing.\u201d \u2022 Bonus viewing for megalomaniac movie night: this synch-up of Bet on It and Frozen\u2019s Let it Go contains another valuable lesson. From great risk comes great reward And the final and most important lesson: leap into the unknown. Just look at Troy and Gabriella. They were thrust together when a roaming spotlight picked them both out for a karaoke duet. Neither wanted to sing. But they took a risk and went on to build a beautiful relationship, unite a divided community and get progressively better hair-dos. Those are just three of the achievements Trump and Kim should be striving for. Trump has said the summit should be the start of a \u201cnew relationship\u201d \u2013 I can just imagine the two of them snuggled up on the sofa deciding that, if they can both step out of their comfort zones and have a go at being normal people, Troy and Gabriella\u2019s first, oh-so-prophetic song could apply to them, too. \u201cThis could be the start of something new/It feels so right to be here with you/And now, looking in your eyes/I feel in my heart/the start of something new.\u201d But there\u2019s one lesson they should definitely ignore \u2026 Explosions will save the day Yes, when Gabriella can\u2019t attend a callback audition because she has the final of the scholastic decathlon, her team comes to the rescue by creating a chemical reaction that gets the science lab evacuated. But that was a specific case. That\u2019s not the lesson here, world leaders. The scholastic decathletes did have one useful titbit for our duo, though: when the world divides into peaceful, educated grown-ups and chest-beating Neanderthal bullies, \u201cbe on the right side of civilization\u201d, guys. \u2022 Lucinda Everett writes about the arts, entertainment and lifestyle.
