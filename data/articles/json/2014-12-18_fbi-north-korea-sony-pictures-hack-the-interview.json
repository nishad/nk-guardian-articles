    "content": "The White House says it is treating the hacking of Sony Pictures as a serious national security matter, after the film company reportedly scrapped the global release of controversial comedy The Interview. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters the attack was by a \u201csophisticated actor\u201d and that the president\u2019s top security officials have met daily to discuss a response. The hack of Sony by a group calling itself Guardians Of Peace (GOP) has caused outrage and embarrassment at the Hollywood studio. On Wednesday, Sony cancelled the US theatrical release of the comedy, which depicts the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The company later said it \u201chas no further release plans\u201d for the film, including theatrical release, DVD, or video on demand. Anonymous White House officials have said the US had evidence that the hack was coordinated by North Korea. On Thursday, Earnest said he was not in a position to confirm North Korea\u2019s alleged responsibility. Pyongyang has denied involvement in the hack. In June, North Korea\u2019s UN ambassador called the film \u201can undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war\u201d. Sony pulled the movie in the US after major movie chains said they would not show the film, due to open on Christmas Day. \u201cIn light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show The Interview, we have decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release,\u201d the studio said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. That decision followed a threat from GOP to cinemagoers. \u201cThe world will be full of fear,\u201d the message read. \u201cRemember the 11th of September 2001.\u201d The scrapping of the movie triggered a furious reaction from Hollywood, where there are concerns that the hackers\u2019 victory will lead to self-censorship by the studios. Another movie based in North Korea and starring Steve Carell has already been cancelled in the wake of the furore. \u201cSad day for creative expression,\u201d Carell said via Twitter. Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the screeplay for The Social Network and The West Wing, said the media who publishing the information leaked by GOP were responsible for the film\u2019s axing. \u201cToday the US succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists who threatened to kill moviegoers in order to stop the release of a movie,\u201d he said in a statement given to Deadline Hollywood. \u201cThe wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the American press who chose gossip and schadenfreude-fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public \u2013 a story that was developing right in front of their eyes.\u201d Actor and comedian Chris Rock said the scandal had sent shockwaves throughout Hollywood. \u201cThis whole thing is just scary,\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s e-mails, it\u2019s your private stuff. And the whole town is scared...nobody knows what to do.\u201d Anonymous law enforcement officials quoted by Fox News on Thursday said the FBI was expected to publicly announce North Korea\u2019s connection to the hack. But a spokeswoman for the FBI told the Guardian it was \u201cunclear at this time\u201d if any public announcement would be made. Republican senator John McCain described the decision to cancel the film\u2019s release and the hack\u2019s reported links to North Korea as \u201cprofoundly troubling\u201d. \u201cBy effectively yielding to aggressive acts of cyber-terrorism by North Korea, that decision sets a troubling precedent that will only empower and embolden bad actors to use cyber as an offensive weapon even more aggressively in the future,\u201d senator McCain said in statement. Civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton announced he was set to meet Sony co-chair Amy Pascal on Thursday to discuss an email exchange published by the hackers, which included racially insensitive remarks referencing President Obama\u2019s favourite films. Pascal and veteran film producer Scott Rudin joked that Obama would prefer to watch films about African Americans, ahead of meeting at the White House. Both have apologised, but some civil rights leaders have called on Pascal to resign.
