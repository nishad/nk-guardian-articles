    "content": "American student Otto Warmbier has been sentenced to 15 years\u2019 hard labour for \u201csevere crimes\u201d against the North Korean state. The 21-year-old University of Virginia student was detained on 2 January after he allegedly stole a political propaganda poster from the restricted \u201cfifth floor\u201d of his hotel in Pyongyang. In North Korea\u2019s typically theatrical manner, Warmbier was then paraded on state TV at the end of February, sobbing and begging for forgiveness. He was further accused of plotting to destroy state unity under the \u201ctacit connivance of the US government and under its manipulation\u201d. The sentence for what he says was the \u201cthe worst mistake\u201d of his life is likely to inflame tensions between Pyongyang and Washington, already running high after Pyongyang\u2019s quick succession of nuclear tests this year. Thousands of westerners travel to the authoritarian state without incident every year, so while Warmbier\u2019s case is rare, it is not unique. North Korea is thought to be currently detaining two other western prisoners over crimes against the state, and has a history of making high-profile arrests to gain leverage with the US, presenting prisoners on TV and forcing diplomats into negotiations. So who else has been caught up in this political game? And how were they charged? We look at some of Pyongyang\u2019s most recent western arrests. Kim Dong-chul \u2013 detained for \u2018espionage\u2019 In January reports began to circulate that North Korea was holding an American citizen who they were accusing of stealing state secrets. Originally a South Korean businessman who had become a US citizen, the man identified as Kim Dong-chul gave an interview to CNN claiming he had spied on behalf of \u201cSouth Korean conservative elements\u201d hoping to overthrow leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime. The 62-year-old told the reporter that he had travelled extensively between China and North Korea in recent years, and showed them a copy of his passport. A defector later undermined his confession, thought to have been made under duress, and claimed that he was on a humanitarian mission to the country. \u201cHe told the churches that he was a missionary working on North Korea and sending stuff from China into the North to help poor North Koreans,\u201d said Ma Young-ae, who recognised him after seeing him on television. Further details of his fate are yet to emerge. Hyeon Soo Lim \u2013 detained for \u2018crimes against the state\u2019 Hyeon Soo Lim, a South Korean-born Canadian pastor and head of one of the country\u2019s largest presbyterian churches, was sentenced life with hard labour in December. The 60-year-old has since said though he \u201cwasn\u2019t originally a labourer\u201d he has now \u201cgotten used to it\u201d. In a video released on a state-controlled website after his arrest last February, Lim appeared to read from a script as he admitted his guilt. \u201cThe worst crime I committed was to rashly defame and insult the highest dignity and the system of the republic,\u201d he said. His confession drew widespread scepticism, as other foreigners formerly detained in the North came forward to say they too had been coerced into making similarly incriminating statements. Jeffrey Fowle \u2013 170 days for \u2018leaving a bible at a club\u2019 An American who was held for nearly six months in 2014 was only freed after a US diplomat flew out to Pyongyang to negotiate his release. Back in the US, Fowle said he had been arrested because he left a Korean-English Bible in a nightclub toilet in Pyongyang. The DPRK is one of the world\u2019s worst place to be Christian, where any form of \u201cevangelism\u201d is considered a serious crime. A report released by the Korean Central News Agency said that Kim Jong-un had taken \u201ca special measure\u201d by releasing Fowle, taking \u201cinto consideration the repeated requests of US president Barack Obama.\u201d Matthew Miller \u2013 202 days because he \u2018wanted to stay\u2019 Getting arrested during his trip to the DPRK was apparently exactly what 23-year-old US citizen Matthew Miller was hoping for. \u201cI was trying to stay in the country... I just wanted to speak to an ordinary North Korean person,\u201d said Miller in an interview with NK News after he was released. \u201cThey wanted me to leave. The very first night they said, \u2018We want you to leave on the next flight.\u2019 But I refused.\u201d Miller was arrested in April 2014 and went on trial five months later. He was sentenced to six years of hard labour for entering the country illegally and for committing \u201chostile acts\u201d. He said the charges were partly true: he had wanted to claim asylum in the country, and confirmed he had had intentionally damaged his tourist visa upon crossing the border. In September 2014, when CNN were in North Korea to film the International Pro-Wrestling Contest, reporters were offered five-minute interviews with Miller, Fowle and fellow detainee Kenneth Bae where all three reportedly gave \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201ceerily similar\u201d statements about their incarceration. Fowle was released the next month, but Miller and Bae had to wait until November when US director of national intelligence, James Clapper, visited the country and negotiated their release. Kenneth Bae - 738 days for \u2018proselytising under the guise of tourism\u2019 The most high-profile of the recent western detainees, Kenneth Bae, a missionary from Washington, was originally given a 15-year sentence in 2012 for alleged \u201canti-state\u201d crimes. A frequent visitor to North Korea and the head of Nation Tours, Bae was arrested while leading a tour group to the north-eastern port city of Rajin. He was accused of conducting illegal religious activity and proselytising under the guise of tourism. His detention, which came at a tense time in relations with the US, caused widespread speculation that Pyongyang was using him as a pawn to force political concessions. He spent two years in North Korea before Clapper helped negotiate his release. Bae is reportedly planning a book about his two-year-ordeal.",
