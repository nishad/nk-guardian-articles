    "content": "Boris Johnson has warned there is \u201cno easy military solution\u201d to prevent North Korea escalating its nuclear aggression but said all options were still on the table for retaliation after the regime\u2019s nuclear weapons test. The UK foreign secretary said it was not clear how a military response from the west would be possible, given the proximity of the South Korean capital, Seoul, to the North Korean border. Any military challenge to Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime could come at huge cost to civilian lives in the South, Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly our view that none of the military options are good,\u201d he told reporters after North Korea announced it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to an intercontinental ballistic missile \u201cIt is of course right to say that all options are on the table, but we really don\u2019t see an easy military solution,\u201d he said. Were the west to hit back with force against North Korea, \u201cthey could basically vapourise\u201d large parts of the population even with conventional weapons, Johnson said. \u201cSo that\u2019s not really very easy to threaten and to deliver,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch more productive, we think, is to continue with the international diplomatic effort.\u201d The foreign secretary\u2019s comments put him at odds with the US president, Donald Trump, who ramped up the rhetoric on Sunday by accusing South Korea in a tweet of favouring a policy of \u201cappeasement\u201d, telling Seoul that method would not work because the North Koreans \u201conly understand one thing!\u201d Johnson called for \u201ccommon sense\u201d to prevail in the crisis and urged Beijing to put further pressure on Kim\u2019s regime. \u201cThere is no question that this is another provocation. It is reckless. They seem to be moving closer towards a hydrogen bomb, which, if fitted to a successful missile, would unquestionably present a new order of threat. \u201cWe have to consider how to respond and it\u2019s our view in the UK, overwhelmingly, that peaceful diplomatic means are the best.\u201d The foreign secretary said the UK could not accept China\u2019s suggestion that there was an equivalence between the South Korea-American military exercises and nuclear testing conducted by North Korea. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept that: what the South Koreans do is entirely legitimate, it\u2019s peaceful, it\u2019s been going on for years, it doesn\u2019t represent any illegal provocation of that kind,\u201d he said. \u201cOur message to the Chinese is, and we are working ever more closely with them, we think there is more scope for you, the Chinese, to put economic pressure on the North Koreans. It has worked, we have seen signs in the last six months of Chinese pressure actually changing the approach of North Koreans \u2013 let\u2019s see if we can do it again.\u201d Theresa May has condemned the latest nuclear test by North Korea as \u201creckless\u201d, saying it is more pressing than ever to look at increasing the pace of implementing sanctions on the regime. The prime minister said the test, North Korea\u2019s sixth since 2006, \u201cposes an unacceptable further threat to the international community\u201d. May reiterated the call she made with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, during her trip to Japan last week for tougher action against Kim Jong-Un. \u201cI discussed the serious and grave threat these dangerous and illegal actions present with President Abe in Japan this week and reiterate the call we jointly made for tougher action, including increasing the pace of implementation of existing sanctions and looking urgently in the UN security council at new measures,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is now even more pressing. The international community has universally condemned this test and must come together to continue to increase the pressure on North Korea\u2019s leaders to stop their destabilising actions.\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry said the North Korean test had come \u201cin spite of widespread opposition from the international community ... the Chinese government resolutely opposes and strongly condemns it.\u201d The explosion overnight caused a 6.3-magnitude earthquake felt in Yanji, China, which is about six miles from North Korea\u2019s Punggye-ri nuclear test site. South Korea\u2019s meteorological administration estimated the blast yield to be five to six times more powerful than North Korea\u2019s fifth test in September last year.",
