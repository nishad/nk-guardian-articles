    "content": "A senior White House official has refused to say if Donald Trump supports his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who reportedly spoke with Russia\u2019s ambassador about sanctions relief weeks before the new president took office. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to tell you what\u2019s in the president\u2019s mind,\u201d Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to Trump, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cThat\u2019s a question for the president. Asked and answered.\u201d Asked if the White House had given him any guidance on Flynn\u2019s position, Miller said: \u201cThey did not give me anything to say.\u201d Against a backdrop of potentially hazardous international flashpoints, including North Korean ballistic missile tests and intensified civil war in Ukraine, the president\u2019s closest aide would normally be his national security adviser. Trump has kept Flynn close ever since the retired lieutenant general became one of few former Pentagon chiefs to back his campaign. But Flynn has also long held links to the Kremlin, including appearances on the propaganda arm RT, and has few allies in the intelligence agencies, from which he was acrimoniously ousted during the Obama administration. In December, weeks before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Flynn spoke with Russia\u2019s ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, by phone. He and Vice-President Mike Pence denied that he spoke with Kislyak about sanctions placed on high-level officials by the US government, which could have violated a federal law that bars private citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes. On Thursday, however, nine current and former officials told the Washington Post that Flynn had in fact discussed sanctions, imposed over Russian actions in Ukraine and hacking political parties in the 2016 US election. A spokesman for Flynn subsequently reversed course, saying the former general \u201ccouldn\u2019t be certain\u201d that he had not discussed sanctions. The White House said Pence had only heard about the call from Flynn. More than a day after the publication of the report, Trump professed ignorance about it, saying he would \u201clook into\u201d the call. Leading Democrats, including the ranking member on the intelligence committee, have called for an FBI investigation. Trump was expected to be asked about Flynn at a press conference with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on Monday. On Monday morning the Kremlin denied that Flynn and Kislyak had spoken about lifting sanctions. Flynn emerged as an obstreperous force during the campaign and become an ally of the president\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Both men remain close to Trump despite the tides of criticism washing over them. Beyond Flynn\u2019s friendliness toward Russia and his poor relations with intelligence agencies \u2013 the CIA rejected a security clearance for one of his aides this week \u2013 his son personally provoked Trump\u2019s wrath for peddling a conspiracy theory about a Washington pizza shop. Bannon, a businessman who formerly ran Breitbart News \u2013 a website popular with the far right and known for its racist and sexist articles \u2013 prompted bipartisan alarm when he was named to the National Security Council in a post outranking the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the director of national intelligence. Miller, himself close to Bannon, seemed to allude to backstage machinations which have produced a steady stream of leaks to the press from White House aides critical of each other. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive matter,\u201d Miller said on NBC. \u201cGeneral Flynn has served his country admirably. He served his country with distinction.\u201d As if on cue after Miller\u2019s appearance, the president tweeted from his weekend stay at his south Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, where he was hosting Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. \u201cCongratulations Stephen Miller,\u201d the president wrote, \u201con representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!\u201d Trump is an avid viewer of cable news, despite his protestations to the contrary, but the White House fielded few representatives on Sunday\u2019s news shows. The New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, who was ousted from Trump\u2019s transition team by the businessman\u2019s son-in-law, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that Trump, Pence and Flynn would have to meet about whether the general deliberately misled the vice-president. \u201cThat\u2019s a conversation he is going to need to have with the president and the vice-president to clear that up,\u201d Christie said, \u201cso that the White House can make sure that they are completely accurate about what went on.\u201d On Saturday night, the president had little to say about North Korea\u2019s missile test. \u201cI just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, it\u2019s great ally, 100%,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNorth Korea must fully comply with the relevant UN security council resolutions,\u201d Abe said, adding that the launch \u201cabsolutely intolerable\u201d. Miller told Fox News Sunday: \u201cThe message is that we are going to reinforce and strengthen our vital alliances in the Pacific region.\u201d The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said he was sure North Korea was \u201ctesting\u201d Trump. \u201cI was glad he issued the statement with the prime minister of Japan,\u201d Schumer said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cBut he also ought to do it quickly with South Korea. \u201cSouth Korea is probably more susceptible to North Korea\u2019s virulence than any other country. And there was some doubt cast on the relationship in the campaign by then candidate Trump.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks on Saturday fell in line with conventional US foreign policy \u2013 and not campaign suggestions that Asian countries should build nuclear arsenals or pay the US more to defend them. Earlier this week, Trump similarly backed down from his suggestion that the US would not recognize Beijing\u2019s \u201cOne China\u201d policy, and might instead review Taiwan\u2019s status of independence.",
