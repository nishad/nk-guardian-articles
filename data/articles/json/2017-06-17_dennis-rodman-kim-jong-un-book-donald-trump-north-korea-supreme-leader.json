    "content": "Say what you like about the former US basketball star Dennis Rodman, but he\u2019s not the kind of deadbeat freeloader to visit a murderous foreign dictator empty handed. Travelling to North Korea to see the sports minister, Rodman also brought along an eclectic selection of gifts for his avowed \u201cfriend for life\u201d and brother by another mother, basketball fan and supreme leader, Kim Jong-un. Only recently, North Korea threatened the US with war after Senator John McCain called Kim a \u201ccrazy fat kid\u201d, so we can only hope that this didn\u2019t put a crimp on Rodman\u2019s stay. His gifts for Kim included a Donald Trump book (which I like to think was titled How to Rool Bigly); a travel version of what Brits call Where\u2019s Wally? (a little bit insensitive considering how many people \u201cdisappear\u201d in North Korea, but perhaps the airport had run out of giant Toblerone?); a selection of posh soaps (for Kim to wash the persistent assassination threats right out of his hair?); and a mermaid puzzle because\u2026 well, who knows? Perhaps Kim had confided to Rodman that, just like Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s Little Mermaid, he dreamed of joining the human race one day. By anybody\u2019s reckoning, these were thoughtful, well-chosen presents and only a bleak and cynical heart would wonder (without any justification whatsoever) whether they exposed a grimly random and immature psychopathy in either the gift-giver or the recipient. When those pressies were being excitedly torn open, it must have felt akin to Christmas, only, instead of accompanied by snow, the threat of imminent global nuclear annihilation. You\u2019ve got to hand it to him \u2013 Rodman managed to solve the age-old conundrum: \u201cWhat do you give to the man who has everything\u2026 and wants to blow it all up?\u201d",
