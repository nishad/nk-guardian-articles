    "content": "Late-night hosts on Tuesday discussed the historic summit in Singapore between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Trevor Noah Comedy Central\u2019s Trevor Noah gave credit where it was due for the summit. \u201cBefore we start we\u2019ve all got to admit that we were wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said the man couldn\u2019t do it. We said his temper would blow up the summit. But yesterday he proved everyone wrong and turned the nuclear summit in Singapore into a huge win for himself. So let\u2019s swallow our pride and give it up for a leader who\u2019s much smarter than we thought: Kim Jong-un, everybody!\u201d Noah, who said, the summit \u201cbelonged to Lil\u2019 Kim,\u201d, went on: \u201cPeople are screaming for a brutal tyrant like he\u2019s the newest member of BTS. Even Kim Jong-un is probably surprised by this reaction. He\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m used to screaming, but not happy screaming!\u2019\u201d \u201cIt turns out Kim\u2019s biggest admirer wasn\u2019t in those crowds outside,\u201d the host said. \u201cFanboy number one was right there at the summit.\u201d In footage from the photo op staged between the two leaders, Trump can be heard shaking Kim\u2019s hand and saying it is his \u201cgreat honor\u201d to meet him. \u201cYes, you heard that right,\u201d Noah said. \u201cPresident Trump said meeting Kim Jong-un was his great honor. This alone is what North Korea has been pining for for decades: equal standing with the American president, shaking hands, their flags side by side.\u201d He continued: \u201cDonald Trump flew across the world to Singapore and all he got was Kim Jong-un saying, \u2018I\u2019ll think about giving up my nukes.\u2019 They could\u2019ve done it over text. And while Kim gave up nothing major, he got the American president to give up a lot more.\u201d Trump, Noah explained, agreed to halt joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, a concession that took South Korean diplomats by surprise. \u201cI\u2019m not saying President Trump shouldn\u2019t have negotiated with Kim Jong-un at all,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a big gap between being civil with the person and endorsing the Freddy Krueger of human rights.\u201d Stephen Colbert The Late Show\u2019s Stephen Colbert also chimed in on the summit. \u201cToday we all woke up in a different world, because late last night yesterday morning Donald Trump held his long-awaited summit with North Korean dictator and stuffed animal of himself, Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Stephen Colbert. \u201cAnd from the beginning, Donald Trump signaled he was serious about peace because he didn\u2019t greet Kim with his normal alpha-male hand battle.\u201d In Singapore, Colbert added, the two shared a lunch where \u201cKorean stuffed cucumber\u201d was on the menu. \u201cWell, there\u2019s your headline,\u201d the host joked. \u201cTrump ate a vegetable. \u201cThe two leaders got along great. Trump even showed Kim the inside of his Cadillac,\u201d he continued, impersonating the president negotiating with the North Korean dictator. \u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna take to talk you out of your nukes and into this Cadillac? \u201cThen the moment came that the world was waiting for, the signing of the histor-ish agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the reviews are in.\u201d Colbert then cut to news coverage of the agreement signed by Trump and Kim, which was hailed as a victory by the US president and criticized as weak and inconsequential by others. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cKim got US security guarantees, but in exchange he agreed to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but that was just reaffirming an earlier agreement he already had with South Korea. \u201cYou have to promise more than Kim did when you sign the iTunes user agreement, and I\u2019m not making that up,\u201d the host added, before reading aloud Apple\u2019s terms and conditions. \u201cApple makes you agree to not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel also addressed the summit, beginning: \u201cOur president, Donald Trump, met with his favorite little rocket man Kim Jong-un. \u201cA lot of pundits think it was a mistake to meet with an unstable dictator,\u201d Kimmel joked, \u201cbut Kim Jong-un said, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to do it anyway.\u2019 \u201cThe closest thing I can compare it to is when Scooby-doo met the Harlem Globetrotters,\u201d the host quipped. \u201cAccording to the president, it all went very well. Trump said that he and Kim Jong-un, after 38 minutes of meeting, developed what he called a special bond. That\u2019s fast. His dentures take longer to bond.\u201d Kimmel then noted that Trump claimed Kim Jong-un committed to destroy a major missile testing site, but didn\u2019t include it in the signed agreement \u201cbecause we didn\u2019t have time\u201d. \u201cIn fact, the president invited him to the White House, which is crazy when you consider he hasn\u2019t even invited the WNBA champions to the White House and they\u2019ve killed a lot fewer people. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the real backstory is, but I know the whole thing,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cTrump wanted to make it look like he did something big, whether he did something big or not. He was not leaving this summit without claiming he made a deal. He sets the meeting, he has the sit-down, he hears what he wants to hear. As soon as the meeting is over he runs out, calls a press conference, declares victory, everyone goes home. Kim Jong-un does nothing differently at all.\u201d",
