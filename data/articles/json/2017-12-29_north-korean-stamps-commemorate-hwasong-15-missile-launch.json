    "content": "North Korea\u2019s state stamp bureau has issued a collection to commemorate last month\u2019s launch of a rocket that the regime claims can hit anywhere in the US. According to images released by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, the stamps feature the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, which was successfully tested on 29 November. A government statement after the launch, which took place about 18 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang, quoted leader Kim Jong-un as saying: \u201cNow we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.\u201d The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the launch \u201cbrings us closer to war\u201d, while the US president, Donald Trump, said of Kim Jong-un: \u201cLittle Rocket Man, he is a sick puppy.\u201d One of the images released with the stamps shows Kim Jong-un appearing to monitor the progress of the launch. This is not the first time North Korea has produced this type of stamp. In August one was issued featuring Kim Jong-un celebrating the launch of the predecessor Hwasong-14 missile. The military propaganda of recent stamps is a far cry from those issued in North Korea during the 1970s and 80s, which were more likely to feature cats and dogs. Stamp designs have previously been known to escalate tensions in the region. In 2004 a stamp issued by South Korea depicting disputed islands known as Tokdo in South Korea and as Takeshima in Japan sparked a diplomatic row.",
