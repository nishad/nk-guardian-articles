Comment is free hosts dozens of discussions on a wide range of subjects, including news, politics and culture, as well as personal perspectives on the way we live now. We wanted to explore different ways of expressing comment and so commissioned spoken word artists and poets to write and perform a bespoke piece with a comment angle. The first in the mini-series is the poet Hollie McNish. If you\u2019re a spoken word artist or a poet we\u2019d love to hear from you.
