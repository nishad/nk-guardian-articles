Desertion carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, but Mr Jenkins is reportedly hoping for a plea bargain. Officials in Washington are eager to pursue his case, but the Japanese government has an interest in keeping him out of prison. His wife, Hitomi Soga, was among dozens of Japanese abducted by North Korean spies during the cold war.The pair met and married met in the communist state. She returned to Japan in 2002, but he only came back this year.",
