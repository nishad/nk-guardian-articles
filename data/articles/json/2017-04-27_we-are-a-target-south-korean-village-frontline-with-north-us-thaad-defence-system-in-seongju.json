    "content": "It took just a few hours to transform Seongju from a sleepy farming village in the South Korean foothills into a symbol of the US military might ranged against North Korea. Once a retreat for amateur golfers , the Lotte Seongju country club is now in the hands of the most powerful military in the world and its South Korean allies. On land where dispirited golfers once cursed a badly sliced drive, work is under way to rush into service a defence system able to locate and destroy North Korean missiles before they threaten the South \u2013 or the 28,500 US troops stationed there. Villagers complained about the disruption caused by the arrival of the terminal high-altitude area defense (Thaad) system but the impact has been spread far beyond the bucolic hills of Seongju. The deployment has dominated the final days of South Korea\u2019s election campaign, pushed Seoul\u2019s relations with Beijing to breaking point and cast doubt on the wisdom of Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s decision to dispense with \u201cstrategic patience\u201d towards Pyongyang. Most of Seongju\u2019s few hundred residents were asleep when six camouflaged trailers rolled in before dawn on Wednesday, carrying the components of the Thaad system. As they digested their sudden \u2013 and unwanted \u2013 propulsion into the heart of the latest round of tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, bewilderment quickly turned to anger. \u201cLook at how beautiful this place is,\u201d said Baek Gwang-soon, a resident in her mid-70s who was briefly questioned by police as she left her home to tend her crops. \u201cUntil a few weeks ago, I had no idea what Thaad even was and now it\u2019s right on our doorstep.\u201d When assembled, the first battery will comprise six truck-mounted launchers that can fire up to 48 interceptors towards incoming missiles picked up by the system\u2019s X-band radar. Originally scheduled to go into operation by the end of the year, Thaad could be up and running in time to further complicate South Korea \u2019s presidential election on 9 May \u2013 a vote triggered by domestic political scandal but which has been dominated by the North and Thaad. Moon Jae-in, a liberal former human rights lawyer who is favourite to succeed Park Geun-hye, who was impeached , condemned Thaad\u2019s deployment. But to the disappointment of his liberal support base, he has promised only to reconsider its long-term future. Trump has expressed an intention to take a tougher stance against Pyongyang over its missile and nuclear programmes but it is unclear how his administration will act differently from Barack Obama\u2019s . Trump and his officials have hinted that they would respond militarily to a further nuclear or missile test by North Korea. However, such action from the US would be fraught with risks of triggering a wider war with mass casualties. After a rare White House briefing to the entire US Senate on Wednesday, Washington told the South Korean government that sanctions and diplomatic pressure remained its priorities for dealing with North Korea. Adm Harry Harris, commander of the US Pacific command, said on Wednesday: \u201c[Thaad] will be operational in the coming days and able to better defend South Korea against the growing North Korean threat.\u201d He added that the US carrier strike group led by the USS Carl Vinson \u2013 which Trump had described as an \u201carmada\u201d \u2013 was now east of Okinawa and within \u201cstriking range\u201d of North Korea. The people of Seongju were not reassured, however. On top of concerns about the effect the defence system\u2019s radar\u2019s electromagnetic waves may have on them and their melon crops, many believe Thaad\u2019s deployment has put them firmly in Pyongyang\u2019s sights. \u201cWe are worried that we are now a North Korean target,\u201d said Seongju\u2019s mayor, Lee Seok-joo. \u201cBut there is also a strong element of political theatre in all of this. To get the votes they need, the main candidates in the presidential election are pandering to conservative voters \u2013 and that means not outwardly opposing Thaad.\u201d But the deployment of the missiles is not unanimously welcomed by voters in Seoul, 155 miles (250 km) north-west of Seongju. Twice a year, air raid sirens ring out across the South Korean capital, emptying its busy streets in minutes as people take cover in subway stations and underground shopping arcades. The drills are a reminder that Seoul and its population of 10 million people are just 35 miles south of the demilitarised zone, the heavily armed border that has separated north from south since the cessation of Korean war in an uneasy truce more than six decades ago. But on a warm Thursday afternoon, North Korea appeared furthest from the minds of many of the city\u2019s residents. In the Sinchon neighbourhood, shoppers paused to watch a trio of young K-pop hopefuls going through the motions, while university students filled cafes. Seoul did as it often does when faced with a North Korean crisis, and offer a collective shrug of the shoulders. Cho Eun-hye, a 21-year-old civil servant, laughed when asked whether she was concerned about a North Korean missile attack. \u201cRather than give in to the Americans by deploying Thaad, I would rather see South Korea make a genuine attempt to engage with the North,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might not bring about reunification but, at the very least, we will be able to peacefully coexist.\u201d But older South Koreans, who played a decisive role in installing Park and her equally conservative predecessor Lee Myung-bak in the presidential Blue House, were less optimistic. \u201cPeople of my generation are more worried about our national security because we know what war is like,\u201d said Kwon Ki-hwan, who was 12 when the Korean war started in 1950. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what happens to people during a war with my own eyes, so I support anyone who puts our security first. And that includes deploying Thaad. \u201cI would prefer peace through talks, of course, but that\u2019s for the politicians to decide. My biggest fear is that one day we will have a second Korean war. It might be sparked by a decision made by the US, but the victims will be Koreans.\u201d In Seongju, residents vowed they were not about to abandon their newfound role as activists on the frontline of South Korean politics. Although many voted for Park, who agreed to deploy Thaad just before her presidency was plunged into crisis last summer, they were holding aloft banners this week in Seoul that would not have been out of place at a leftwing rally: \u201cNo Thaad. No War\u201d, and \u201cHey USA \u2013 are you friends or occupation troops?\u201d Moon\u2019s foreign policy adviser, Choi Jong-kun, said: \u201cThe public are fed up with the status quo on North Korea. They want pressure and sanctions to be joined by some sort of engagement.\u201d Moon wants to bring the North Koreans to the negotiating table \u201cto make them ponder what might happen if we sat down together\u201d, according to Choi, an associate professor of politics and international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cUntil now, it\u2019s been the same old mantra from South Korea: unless you change first, we won\u2019t talk to you.\u201d Choi said a Moon presidency would work closely with the Trump administration but would \u201cregain control\u201d of North Korea policy after weeks of political limbo after Park\u2019s impeachment. \u201cMoon is alarmed by the idea that ensuring the safety of South Koreans could one day be beyond our control,\u201d he said. \u201cConservatives liked to boast that they took a hardline against the North and were stronger on national security, but the scorecard for the past two presidents says the exact opposite.\u201d",
