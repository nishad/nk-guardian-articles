    "content": "Kim Jong-un will meet South Korean leader Moon Jae-in on 27 April, only the third time leaders from the two countries have met and the first since Kim took power in 2011 after the death of his father. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, and this meeting could touch on a formal truce. It will also be focused on preparing the ground for US president Donald Trump to meet Kim in May or June. Here is everything you need to know about the historic meeting. What is happening? Kim and Moon will meet in Panmunjom, a village in the joint security areas on the heavily militarised border between the two neighbours. The eyes of the world will be on the summit and its tone will have a major impact on any meeting between Kim and Trump. Why is it important? This is only the second time Kim will meet another head of state, after a brief trip to China last month. This is also the first time in a decade that South Korea is led by a liberal government that wants to actively engage with the North. In many ways, Moon has been preparing for engagement with North Korea for most of his career. \u201cThe Inter-Korean summit is like the opening move in chess. How you play it sets up the other possible moves that come after it,\u201d said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy. \u201cSo the Inter-Korean summit\u2019s significance lies primarily in what atmosphere it creates and what expectations it reinforces heading into the next move, which is the Trump-Kim summit.\u201d What\u2019s the history? North and South Korea have been divided since the end of the Korean War, and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. There have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked. This is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished. North Korea pledged to relinquish its nuclear programme in 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009. Why now? Kim feels he has developed his nuclear and missile programmes to sufficient degree that they act as a deterrent against any attack and give North Korea significant negotiating power. \u201cKim Jong-un is trying to repair the relations that have really deteriorated over the last few years while they developed nuclear weapons,\u201d said Jenny Town, the assistant director of the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. In his new year\u2019s address, Kim extended an olive branch and offered to participate the Winter Olympics, which was held in South Korea in February. That participation led to a series of meetings culminating in this months summit and a planned meeting between Kim and Trump. What do both sides want? Both leader\u2019s interests are broadly aligned. They want to claim the summit as a success and both sides know the real goal is an agreement between the US and the North. Seoul has also suggested it could try to replace the current armistice agreement with a formal peace treaty, but it wants the North to agree to denuclearise. \u201cFor Moon, the summit is valuable because it makes it harder for the United States or North Korea to escalate tensions and gives him a lever to push both countries toward Moon\u2019s ultimate goal: a comprehensive US-North Korea deal,\u201d Oba said. \u201cFor Kim, it\u2019s a way of increasing his options, putting pressure on the United States to deal with him on his terms, and convincing the world he is acting in good faith so that the blame for any future setbacks will be on the United States and not North Korea.\u201d Kim will also likely be looking for relief from the sanctions currently imposed on his country. \u201cNorth Korea will be focusing on repairing diplomatic ties and figuring out how they can repair their economy,\u201d Town said. \u201cMoon also wants to look at restarting Inter-Korea economic cooperation.\u201d What are the possible outcomes? While North Korea has repeatedly signalled it is willing to give up its nuclear weapons, the conditions for that to happen may be too high a price to pay for the US and its allies. \u201cThe worst case scenario is learning the North Korean definition of denuclearization is untenable with international community\u2019s expectations,\u201d Town said. \u201cWhen they think of denuclearization, they think it will come about over decades.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s also dependent on having good relations with the US, and North Korea has seen the US pull out of many international agreements, so they won\u2019t trust a simple promise, they want to build trust over time.\u201d Kim is acutely aware of the fate of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up his weapons programmes only to have European and US forces bomb the country during an uprising against him. Other possibilities include a meeting relatively light on substance, focused on building goodwill between both sides and positive photo opportunities instead of touching on issues that could cause conflict. What comes next? There is little chance of a concrete agreement of any kind resulting from the summit. Beginning negotiations with a meeting between the two leaders, before any details have been hammered out, is always risky. The meeting will likely be followed by months, if not years, of negotiations at the lower levels before anything is signed. \u201cThey\u2019ll likely come away with good intentions but not necessarily sustainable policies,\u201d said Town.",
