    "content": "Kim Jong-nam was killed using the highly toxic liquid nerve agent VX, Malaysian police have said. One of the two women suspected of involvement in the poisoning vomited in police custody and was also suffering the effects of VX, which is only usually used in chemical warfare, the inspector general, Khalid Abu Bakar, said. The findings followed a preliminary analysis of swabs taken from the face and eyes of Kim, the half-brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. More items linked to the attack at Kuala Lumpur airport were still being analysed, police said. VX \u2013 also known as O-ethyl S-diisopropylaminomethyl methylphosphonothiolate \u2013 is classified by the United Nations as a weapon of mass destruction. Kim Jong-nam died on 13 February from a seizure while being taken to hospital after complaining that a woman had sprayed chemicals in his face at Kuala Lumpur airport. Leaked CCTV footage shows a woman grabbing his face. Malaysian police had said earlier that two attackers rubbed a liquid on him before walking away and quickly washing their hands. Asked about the possibility that North Korean agents might have imported the world\u2019s most toxic nerve agent and deployed it in an international airport, a source close to the Malaysian government commented: \u201cNot very diplomatic.\u201d South Korea said the use of VX was a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of international norms. \u201cWe are shocked by the latest revelation by the Malaysian authorities that VX \u2026 was used in the death of Kim Jong-nam,\u201d Seoul\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe use of any chemical weapons is strictly banned for any reason and in any place,\u201d it added. Khalid said authorities were determining how VX entered the country and that the terminal where Kim Jong-nam was killed, in a budget airline departure lounge, would be decontaminated. As a weapon, VX does not quickly dissipate and can remain on material or the ground for long periods. An employee at Malaysia Airports Holdings, the company that manages the airport, told the Guardian it had not closed the terminal or been contacted by police about a decontamination since the attack 11 days ago. China, which afforded a level of protection to Kim Jong-nam during his stays there and in Macau, issued a cautious response to the revelations. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Beijing was aware of media reports about the use of chemicals classified by the UN as a weapon of mass destruction. \u201cWe have also noted the relevant remarks made by Malaysia and the latest developments,\u201d Geng said. \u201cSo far we have seen only preliminary information. There has been no conclusion with regards to this incident.\u201d Liang Yabin, a research fellow at the institute of international strategic studies at the Communist party\u2019s Central Party School, said that, if confirmed, the use of such chemical weapons at an international airport would represent a violation of Malaysian sovereignty and be \u201csimply intolerable\u201d. Liang said the incident was potentially \u201ca justifiable act of war\u201d and that Beijing would increase airport security and the monitoring of people travelling into China from North Korea. Geng said he was not aware of Chinese authorities having issued any travel warning to citizens using Kuala Lumpur airport. The US government\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes VX as the most potent of all nerve agents and one that would be lethal on contact with the skin unless immediately washed off. Its only known use is in chemical warfare, it says. The agency says exposure to a large dose of VX may result in convulsions, loss of consciousness, paralysis and fatal respiratory failure. Kim Jong-nam is reported to have complained of pain in his face shortly after the attack. A leaked photograph at the medical centre shows him laid back on a chair with his eyes closed. VX, a clear, colourless liquid with the consistency of engine oil, was developed in the UK in the 1950s during research into pesticides but was found to be too toxic to be used safely. Saddam Hussein was accused of using VX during the Iran-Iraq war and there are concerns that stockpiles exist in Syria. Only the US and Russia have said they possess VX or a similar agent. North Korea is thought to have one of the world\u2019s largest stockpiles of chemical weapons, and is one of six countries not to have signed or acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), according to the US non-profit organisation the Nuclear Threat Initiative. Defectors have accused North Korea of testing its chemical agents on people. Raymond Zilinskas, who directs the chemical and biological nonproliferation programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, said it seemed unlikely the killers applied VX directly. \u201cEven if they were wearing gloves, the fumes would have killed them,\u201d he said. He suggested the assassins might have used a \u201cbinary concoction\u201d, smearing two non-fatal elements of VX which mixed on the victim\u2019s face. He said that because North Korea was not party to the CWC, Malaysia might ask the UN secretary general to investigate. \u201cWhether North Korea would allow UN inspectors to enter the country is of course a big question,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the matter certainly could be taken up by UN security council and/or general assembly.\u201d Four people of different nationalities have been arrested and seven North Koreans are wanted in connection with the attack. Malaysian police have not directly pinpointed North Korea as being behind the death. The Malaysia Star said police had seized \u201cvarious chemicals\u201d at an apartment in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday night. Malaysia warned North Korea\u2019s outspoken ambassador on Friday he would be thrown out of the country if he continue d to \u201cspew lies\u201d over the investigation. The Malaysian foreign minister, Anifah Aman, lashed out at Kang Chol, who said earlier this week that North Korea could not trust the Malaysian investigation. Kang has also claimed the inquiry is politically motivated and that Malaysia had conspired with South Korea to frame the north. Anifah told Kang he should watch what he sa id. \u201cHe must enjoy the confidence of the government of Malaysia,\u201d Anifah said. \u201cI hope he understands what I mean by he must enjoy the confidence of the government of Malaysia. \u201cThe ambassador has been informed of the process involved but he continues to be delusional and spew lies and accusations against the government of Malaysia.\u201d A senior Malaysian government official said Kang had been shown a \u201cyellow card\u201d, adding: \u201cIf he repeats the baseless allegations, he will be expelled.\u201d Kang has already been summoned to the foreign ministry for a dressing down . In the first report from the state-run North Korean news agency since the attack, the government on Thursday said Malaysia had broken international law by conducting autopsies on a diplomatic passport holder and withholding the body. Tong Zhao, a North Korea expert from at the Carnegie\u2013Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy in Beijing, said the latest revelations about the killing of a man China considered a positive, pro-reform figure, would further damage Chinese confidence in Pyongyang. \u201cThe reason China has been reluctant to impose comprehensive and crippling economic sanctions against North Korea \u2026 is partially due to the fact that China still has faith in the ability of the North Korean government to transform and modernise itself. \u201cSuch faith might be undermined by this recent murder.\u201d Zhao said the news would fuel debate over China\u2019s stance towards its neighbour and could have \u201cfar-reaching implications for China\u2019s overall North Korea policy\u201d. \u201cIf China reconsiders its overall approach to North Korea \u2013 and I think there are already signs of that \u2013 the bilateral relationship could be radically changed,\u201d he said.
