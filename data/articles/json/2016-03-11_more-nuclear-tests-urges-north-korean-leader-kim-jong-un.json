    "content": "Kim Jong-un ordered North Korea to conduct more nuclear tests as he watched a ballistic missile launch, according to the regime\u2019s press agency. The report is thought to refer to the launch of two short-range missiles by North Korea on Thursday that flew 300 miles (500km) and then splashed into the sea. \u201cDear comrade Kim Jong Un said work ... must be strengthened to improve nuclear attack capability and issued combat tasks to continue nuclear explosion tests to assess the power of newly developed nuclear warheads and tests to improve nuclear attack capability,\u201d the Korean Central News Agency said. Tensions rose sharply on the Korean peninsula after the North in January conducted its fourth nuclear test and fired a long-range rocket in February, leading to the UN security council adopting a new sanctions resolution. Conducting more nuclear tests would be in clear violation of UN sanctions which also ban ballistic missile tests, although Pyongyang has rejected them. North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles. The North Korean leader was quoted in state media on Wednesday as saying that his country had miniaturised nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles. South Korea said it did not believe North Korea had successfully miniaturised a nuclear warhead or deployed a functioning intercontinental ballistic missile. Pyongyang has conducted four nuclear tests in the past decade and claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in January but most experts expressed doubt, saying the blast was too small. North Korea has issued nearly daily reports this week of Kim\u2019s instructions to fight South Korea and the United States as those two allies began large-scale military drills. North Korea called the annual drills \u201cnuclear war moves\u201d and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive. Kim ordered his country to be ready to use nuclear weapons in the face of what he described as growing threats from enemies.",
