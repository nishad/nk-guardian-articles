    "content": "Elon Musk has said again that artificial intelligence could be humanity\u2019s greatest existential threat, this time by starting a third world war. The prospect clearly weighs heavily on Musk\u2019s mind, since the SpaceX, Tesla and Boring Company chief tweeted at 2.33am Los Angeles time about how AI could led to the end of the world \u2013 without the need for the singularity. His fears were prompted by a statement from Vladimir Putin that \u201cartificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind \u2026 It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\u201d Hashing out his thoughts in public, Musk clarified that he was not just concerned about the prospect of a world leader starting the war, but also of an overcautious AI deciding \u201cthat a [pre-emptive] strike is [the] most probable path to victory\u201d. He\u2019s less worried about North Korea\u2019s increasingly bold nuclear ambitions, arguing that the result for Pyongyang if they launched a nuclear missile \u201cwould be suicide\u201d \u2013 and that it doesn\u2019t have any entanglements that would lead to a world war even if it did. His view is that AI is \u201cvastly more risky\u201d than the Kim Jong-un-led country. Musk\u2019s fear of AI warfare has been a driving force in his public statements for a long time. Last month, he was one of more than 100 signatories calling for a UN-led ban of lethal autonomous weapons. \u201cOnce developed, lethal autonomous weapons will permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThese can be weapons of terror, weapons that despots and terrorists use against innocent populations, and weapons hacked to behave in undesirable ways. \u201cWe do not have long to act. Once this Pandora\u2019s box is opened, it will be hard to close.\u201d Killer robots? Musk and Zuckerberg escalate row over dangers of AI",
