    "content": "US comic Margaret Cho has defended her controversial appearance as a stony-faced \u201cNorth Korean general\u201d at the Golden Globes following accusations of racism, reports Deadline. The San Francisco-born comedian took to Twitter to point out that as a woman of Korean heritage she had every right to lampoon the authoritarian nation. \u201cI\u2019m of mixed North/South Korean descent \u2013 you imprison, starve and brainwash my people you get made fun of by me #hatersgonhate #FreeSpeech,\u201d she wrote. Cho, 46, later added: \u201cI\u2019m not playing the race card. I\u2019m playing the rice card. #hatersgonwait #winnersgonpun,\u201d in response to her critics. The comic\u2019s appearance as \u201cCho Young-Ja\u201d a North Korean general and supposed member of Globes organising body the Hollywood Foreign Press Association was a running gag during the ceremony. Hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler incited their guest to take a selfie with Meryl Streep \u2013 a moment captured by Michael Keaton on his phone and photobombed by Benedict Cumberbatch. She also insisted award presenter Kristen Wiig should make Bridesmaids 2. On another occasion the general, also a purported contributor to gaudy fictional Korean film magazine Movies, Wow!, complained vociferously at the Globes\u2019 lack of razzmatazz. \u201cYou no have thousand baby playing guitar at the same time. You no have people holding up many card to make one big picture,\u201d she said. \u201cYou no have Dennis Rodman.\u201d The riff was part of Fey and Poehler\u2019s merciless sending-up of the recent cyber-attack on Hollywood studio Sony at the hands of hackers working, according to the FBI, for North Korea. A group styling itself Guardians of Peace began leaking private Sony correspondence on 24 November, apparently in response to the studio\u2019s proposed release of the Kim Jong-un baiting comedy The Interview. The hosts opened the show by labelling assembled luminaries \u201cdespicable, spoiled, minimally talented brats\u201d, a reference to Hollywood producer Scott Rudin\u2019s embarrassingly leaked comments about Angelina Jolie in an email to studio co-chairman Amy Pascal. \u201cTonight we celebrate all of the great television shows that we know and love as well as all the movies that North Korea was OK with,\u201d added Fey later, with Poehler contributing: \u201cThe biggest story in Hollywood this year was when North Korea threatened an attack if Sony Pictures released The Interview, forcing us all to pretend we wanted to see it.\u201d Cho has lampooned North Korea\u2019s leaders before, appearing as Kim Jong-il in 2012 on Fey\u2019s TV series 30 Rock. Korean-American actor Randall Park, who portrays Kim Jong-un in The Interview, leapt to her defence. He wrote on Twitter: \u201cI heart @margaretcho.\u201d",
