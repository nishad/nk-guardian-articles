    "content": "Donald Trump has announced that a 12 June summit with Kim Jong-un will go ahead as planned in Singapore, saying it would mark the beginning of a negotiating process with North Korea that could involve several such meetings. Trump was speaking to reporters after meeting Kim\u2019s top aide, Kim Yong-chol, in the Oval Office. It had been billed as a brief courtesy visit but it continued for more than an hour and 20 minutes. In a lavish show of hospitality, Trump escorted his visitor, a former spy chief and general who is under US sanctions, outside the White House for more informal talks and to pose for photographs with the North Korean delegation. Trump also appeared to accept the North Korean position that its denuclearisation would be a drawn-out process \u2013 not the all-in-one surrender of the regime\u2019s nuclear arsenal that Trump officials had previously demanded. \u201cThe big deal will be on June 12,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process, we\u2019re not go in and sign something on June 12 and we never were. We are going to start a process. And I told them today: take your time. We can go fast, we can go slowly. I think they\u2019d like to see something happen and if we can work something out that will be good.\u201d But in a dramatic downgrading of expectations from the summit, Trump said Singapore meeting would be a \u201cgetting-to-know-you meeting, plus\u201d. Such a meeting, the first ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, has been a longstanding objective of the Pyongyang regime. To achieve it, it has suspended nuclear and long-range missile tests, but has given no undertakings on the scale or speed of its nuclear disarmament. On Friday night the US defence secretary, James Mattis, hinted at some of the agenda for the 12 June talks, saying the \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d issue of America\u2019s troop presence in South Korea would not be on the table and \u201cnor should it be\u201d. If diplomacy with North Korea worked, then troop levels and similar issues could come up, but only in discussions between the US and South Korea. \u201cOur objective remains the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,\u201d Mattis told the Shangri-La Dialogue, a security summit in Singapore. North Korea has entered agreements several times before in which it has promised to disarm, but those agreements all collapsed. In his remarks on Friday, Trump said that \u2013 although existing sanctions would stay in place \u2013 no new measures would be added, ditching the slogan that has defined his policy towards North Korea up to now. \u201cI don\u2019t want to use the term maximum pressure any more,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have hundreds of new sanctions ready to go ... but why would I do that when we\u2019re talking so nicely?\u201d The president said that North Korea\u2019s human rights record was not discussed in the meeting. Kim Yong-chol, the first top North Korean official to visit the White House in 18 years, was met outside the West Wing by the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, and the head of the CIA Korea department, Andrew Kim, who ushered the 72-year-old regime veteran into the Oval Office to meet Trump. Far from being hustled in through the back door of the White House, Kim was welcomed at the south lawn entrance in front of massed ranks of cameras and escorted to the Oval Office, where the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was waiting with Trump. The ceremonial arrival represented a propaganda coup for a regime that has endured decades of isolation. The content of the letter was not immediately apparent. Trump at one point described it as \u201cinteresting\u201d and then claimed not to have opened it. \u201cI may be in for a big surprise, folks,\u201d he said. The Wall Street Journal reported it simply expressed Kim\u2019s interest in going ahead with the Singapore summit, and does not change North Korea\u2019s negotiating positions. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, and Mike Pence, the vice-president \u2013 both hawks on North Korea \u2013 did not take part in the meeting and were nowhere to be seen before and after. Trump\u2019s agreement to enter into a drawn-out negotiating process with North Korea, puts a question mark over Bolton\u2019s future in the White House. He has insisted that any US agreement with Pyongyang would have to involve the regime\u2019s unilateral and rapid surrender of its nuclear weapons programme, which Bolton referred to as the \u201cLibyan model\u201d. The North Korean leader laid his position out during a visit by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Thursday. Quoted by the state news agency, KCNA, Kim said \u201cthe denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be solved on a stage-by-stage basis\u201d in which each party addressed the interests of the other. Vipin Narang, an expert on the North Korean nuclear weapons programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it now appeared that Trump \u201cseems to be ok with a stage-by-stage process\u201d. \u201cIt won\u2019t result in disarmament but a lot of good can still happen,\u201d Narang said. The only other senior North Korean official ever to visit the White House was vice-marshal Jo Myong-rok, who delivered a letter to Bill Clinton from Kim Jong-un\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il. That peace effort collapsed with the election weeks later of George W Bush, who cut off contacts with Pyongyang.",
