    "content": "In the bars and coffee shops along Jongno, the historic avenue through the modern centre of Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital, people talk of the difficulties of finding jobs, of rising prices and the stress of life in a booming city. \u201cYoung people are very uneasy,\u201d says Han Jung-min, who\u2019s found stopgap work in a trendy coffee shop on an alley just off Jongno while looking for \u201ca real job\u201d more commensurate with her college education. \u201cIt\u2019s very depressing.\u201d If there\u2019s one topic to which neither she nor anyone else is giving high priority, however, it\u2019s the threat posed by North Korea and its missiles poised 40 miles to the north. The prospect of an armed clash with North Korea seems about as remote to Han and just about everyone else here as that of a second Korean war. \u201cI think it will go on like this forever,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will keep firing missiles and testing nuclear warheads.\u201d And then what? \u201cMore talk,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cNo one knows how long.\u201d Armageddon may not be at hand, but concerns are rising that somehow something could eventually upset the equilibrium in which the two Koreas have uneasily coexisted since the end of the Korean war 64 years ago this month. Much of the concern focuses on the unpredictability of Donald Trump. \u201cA lot of people are worrying that the US might conduct a pre-emptive strike,\u201d says Maeng Joo-seok, a conservative business consultant. \u201cThat might be very dangerous to the security of the Korean peninsula. People are just watching.\u201d Since the election of the liberal Moon Jae-in as president in May, battles between the patriotic right \u2013 many of them military veterans \u2013 and the anti-American left appear less significant than during the mass protests that forced the removal of Moon\u2019s rightwing predecessor, Park Geun-hye. \u201cMostly people worry about the economy,\u201d says Maeng. Violent protests have flared near to where the American military installed a counter-missile battery system as Thaad (terminal high-altitude area defence) on a former golf course about 250 miles south of Seoul. But Moon in his meetings with Trump made clear he would not order its removal even though he opposed it while Park was president. At the same time, the new president is winning popularity by seeking accommodation \u2013 if not reconciliation \u2013 with the North. His quest seems likely to go on regardless of whether Kim Jong-un orders more missile tests, or even a sixth underground test of a nuclear warhead. \u201cA couple of weekends ago there was a big anti-Thaad protest,\u201d says Jang Sung-eun, a marketing manager for a small company, but \u201csince Moon visited the US and saw Trump, support for Thaad has increased\u201d. While controversy surrounding Thaad is waning, Trump remains a topic of conversation. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about North Korea on a daily basis,\u201d says Jang, \u201cbut I just think Trump is a crazy man.\u201d Really, she asks, \u201cwhat were the Americans thinking?\u201d Jang is not happy about Kim either \u2013 but believes he may be more rational than Trump. \u201cMost people say Kim Jong-un is crazy, probably a nut,\u201d she says. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m more concerned about Trump. I wouldn\u2019t say Trump is a bigger danger \u2013 he\u2019s just so unreliable. We talk about Trump more than Kim Jong-un. He speaks and talks without even thinking.\u201d Like most others, Jang doubts if Trump can do much to live up to some of his boasts. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely Trump will do a pre-emptive strike,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause of China and Russia\u201d \u2013 either or both of which, she believes, would rise to North Korea\u2019s defence. Such comments, though, come out only during much questioning. Most people are not inclined to offer their views unless pressed. No one really seems to know how to end the confrontation \u2013 though the sense emerges that there would be no harm in trying. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d says Kim Young-jin, an office worker nursing a beer, before adding: \u201cIt\u2019s important to try to discourage them from doing a nuclear test. It\u2019s important to try and have a dialogue. We have to try to resolve this.\u201d Lee Hyun-jin, a graduate student, says she support the strategy of Moon trying to talk but doubts Kim Jong-un will respond to his offer of meeting for an inter-Korean summit. \u201cThere must be something they want,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about harmony. We must make clear our aim is just to maintain the situation steadily and peacefully.\u201d But for many, the chances of living in harmony with Kim remain dismally low. Among conservatives, talk of an air raid against the North\u2019s missile facilities is common currency. \u201cPeople in South Korea have totally lost their sense of insecurity,\u201d says Kim Kisam, a former government official who opposed previous efforts at inter-Korean reconciliation. \u201cThey believe their security was covered for free by other people \u2013 meaning American forces defending the South.\u201d Kim Kisam sees no chance that Kim Jong-un will respond to attempts at negotiation. \u201cKim Jong-un is an idiot,\u201d he says. And Trump? \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot too,\u201d he says. \u201cAmerica is totally messed up. The American people are mad. \u201cThe only response we can derive from North Korea is from a surgical strike,\u201d Kim adds. He acknowledges, however, that\u2019s \u201ca minority view\u201d among fellow South Koreans, who he says are obsessed with the pursuit of security in the form of steady work and money. John Rodgers, an American teaching at a private school, wonders if his students exist in a make-believe world. Perhaps, he concludes, \u201cthe apocalypse doesn\u2019t frighten until it hits\u201d.",
