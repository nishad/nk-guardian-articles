    "content": "Japan must brace itself for the possible launch of a nuclear-armed North Korean missile over its territory if the regime carries out a threat to test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean, Japan\u2019s defence minister has said. The warning followed an extraordinary exchange of insults between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in response to the US president\u2019s threat at the UN general assembly to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if Washington was forced to defend itself or its allies. Kim said that he was considering retaliating at the \u201chighest level\u201d, calling Trump a \u201cmentally deranged US dotard\u201d who would \u201cpay dearly\u201d for threatening to destroy his regime. The North Korean foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, suggested Pyongyang could test a powerful nuclear weapon in the Pacific. \u201cIt could be the most powerful detonation of an H-bomb in the Pacific,\u201d Ri, who is due to address the UN general assembly at the weekend, told reporters in New York. \u201cWe have no idea about what actions could be taken as it will be ordered by leader Kim Jong-un.\u201d Trump tweeted in response on Friday: \u201cKim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn\u2019t mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!\u201d Itsunori Onodera, the Japanese defence minister, warned such a test could involve a nuclear device mounted on a medium-range or intercontinental ballistic missile being flown over Japan. \u201cWe cannot deny the possibility it may fly over our country,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, North Korea detonated a powerful hydrogen bomb at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the north-east of the country. The explosion caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake that was felt over the Chinese border in Yanji. Testing a nuclear device beyond its own borders would mark a major escalation in tensions over the regime\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes. Analysts said a nuclear test involving a missile could be \u201ctruly terrifying\u201d if something goes wrong. An atmospheric nuclear test could pose a risk to aircraft and shipping, even if the North declares a keep-out zone, according to Vipin Narang, a nuclear strategy expert at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cAnd if the test doesn\u2019t go according to plan, you could have population at risk, too,\u201d Narang added. \u201cWe are talking about putting a live nuclear warhead on a missile that has been tested only a handful of times. It is truly terrifying if something goes wrong.\u201d Speculation is growing that North Korea will add to its robust verbal response to Trump\u2019s UN speech on Tuesday with a military provocation, possibly a test of a Hwasong-14 missile, which is theoretically capable of reaching Hawaii and Alaska. Chung Sung-yoon, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said there was a \u201cvery high possibility\u201d that Kim would follow through with a provocation of some sort. While the North has claimed it is able to mount a miniaturised nuclear weapon on a missile, the regime has yet to offer definitive proof. The US and Japan have warned they will shoot down any missile they consider a threat to Japanese territory. Monitoring groups estimate that the nuclear test conducted in North Korea this month - its sixth and largest - had a yield of 250 kilotons, which is 16 times the size of the US bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. In a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, Kim called Trump \u201cmentally deranged\u201d and warned him that he would \u201cpay dearly\u201d for issuing threats to the regime during his maiden UN general assembly speech on Tuesday. Describing the president as \u201ca rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire\u201d, Kim drew a critical comparison between Trump and his predecessors in the White House, calling him unfit to hold the position of commander in chief. \u201cFar from making remarks of any persuasive power that can be viewed to be helpful to defuse tension, he made unprecedented rude nonsense one has never heard from any of his predecessors.\u201d In a combative speech, Trump warned he would \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if it attacked the US or its allies, and called on other countries to cut the regime off from its sources of funds. \u201cThe mentally deranged behaviour of the US president openly expressing on the UN arena the unethical will to \u2018totally destroy\u2019 a sovereign state \u2026 makes even those with normal thinking faculty think about discretion and composure,\u201d Kim said. The North Korea leader is thought to be the first of three generations of the Kim dynasty to publicly read out a statement aimed at the international community in his own name. South Korea\u2019s unification ministry said neither Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, nor his grandfather - and North Korean founder - Kim Il-sung, had issued a similar statement. Kim said Trump\u2019s remarks had convinced him \u201cthat the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last\u201d. He added that he was \u201cthinking hard\u201d about his response, but vowed that Trump would \u201cpay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying\u201d North Korea. \u201cAction is the best option in treating the dotard, who, hard of hearing, is uttering only what he wants to say,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history that he would destroy [North Korea], we will consider with seriousness exercising of a corresponding, highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history.\u201d His lengthy criticism of Trump ended: \u201cI will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire.\u201d The statement came just hours after Trump issued a new executive order that expands US sanctions on North Korea\u2019s shipping, banking, ports and manufacturing. Trump also claimed China\u2019s banking system had shut down business with the country. Reuters reported earlier in the day that China\u2019s central bank had ordered financial institutions to implement UN sanctions rigorously after frequent complaints from Washington that Beijing was leaving open too many loopholes. Trump thanked China\u2019s president Xi Jinping and said the move was \u201cvery bold\u201d and \u201csomewhat unexpected\u201d. There was no immediate confirmation from the Chinese government that it had imposed a financial embargo on North Korea. If confirmed, it would represent a significant tightening of the economic noose around the Pyongyang regime, by a country which accounts for 90% of its trade. But it is unclear whether any amount of financial or economic pain would induce Kim Jong-un to relinquish North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and missiles, which he believes are essential for the regime\u2019s survival. Trump announced the new executive order during a working lunch with his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, and Shinz\u014d Abe, the Japanese prime minister. \u201cOur new executive order will cut off sources of revenue that fund North Korea\u2019s efforts to develop the deadliest weapons known to humankind,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe order enhances the treasury department\u2019s authorities to target any individual or entity that conducts significant trade in goods, services, or technology with North Korea.\u201d Under the new measures, no ship or aircraft can visit the US within 180 days of going to North Korea. The same restriction would apply to any vessel involvement in ship-to-ship transfers with North Korean vessels. The order gives the US Treasury the power to sanction anybody involved in a wide variety of North Korean industries, ports, trade, and banking. \u201cForeign financial institutions must choose between doing business with the United States or facilitating trade with North Korea or its designated supporters,\u201d a White House statement said. \u201cTo prevent sanctions evasion, the order also includes measures designed to disrupt critical North Korean shipping and trade networks,\u201d he said. \u201cFor much too long, North Korea has been allowed to abuse the international financial system to facilitate funding for its nuclear weapons and missile programs.\u201d On the same day, the EU announced new sanctions of its own, including a ban on investment in North Korea and on EU exports of oil. The impact will be minimal, as trade and investment relations between North Korea and EU are tiny.",
