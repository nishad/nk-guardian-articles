According to the South Korean media, satellites have tracked a special North Korean train, the usual form of transport for Mr Kim, entering Chinese territory. The reports are impossible to verify, but they come amid growing signs of Chinese anger with Mr Kim over missile tests last month, and anxiety in the region about his next move.",
