    "content": "North Korea has offered to suspend nuclear tests if the US cancels its annual military drills with South Korea. Through its official KCNA news agency, Pyongyang called on Washington to \u201ccontribute to easing tension on the Korean peninsula\u201d by temporarily suspending the military exercises in South Korea \u201cand its vicinity\u201d. It said the message had been passed to American authorities through \u201ca relevant channel\u201d on Friday. \u201cThe DPRK is ready to take such a responsive step as temporarily suspending the nuclear test over which the US is concerned,\u201d KCNA said. The US rejected the overture, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki saying on Saturday the nuclear tests and military exercises were separate issues. \u201cThe DPRK statement that inappropriately links routine US-ROK [South Korea] exercises to the possibility of a nuclear test by North Korea is an implicit threat,\u201d Psaki told reporters traveling with secretary of state John Kerry in Europe. The US and South Korea have carried out the joint military exercises for roughly 40 years, she added. Psaki said the US remained open to dialogue with North Korea and urged Pyongyang to \u201cimmediately cease all threats, reduce tensions, and take the necessary steps toward denuclearization needed to resume credible negotiations\u201d. North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests, the latest in February 2013, the first two in 2006 and 2009. It has threatened to hold another in response to a United Nations resolution condemning its human rights record. The KCNA report said Pyongyang\u2019s proposal was aimed at de-escalating tensions in 2015, in the year of the 70th anniversary of the division of the Korean peninsula into North and South. The two nations have remained technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War, which concluded with a ceasefire. The US has close to 30,000 troops permanently stationed in South Korea and conducts a series of joint military exercises with its key Asian ally every year. Seoul and Washington insist the drills are defensive in nature, but they are regularly condemned by Pyongyang as provocative rehearsals for invasion. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re putting a worm on a line to see if they can get a nibble,\u201d said John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see the US biting, at least not publicly,\u201d he added. Washington has always refused to enter into dialogue with Pyongyang until North Korea shows a tangible commitment to abandoning its entire nuclear weapons programme. Relations between the two countries are particularly tense since North Korea\u2019s alleged role in hacking Sony Pictures\u2019 systems and threatening US moviegoers over film The Interview. Earlier this month, the US imposed economic sanctions against several North Korean government agencies and senior officials earlier this month.",
