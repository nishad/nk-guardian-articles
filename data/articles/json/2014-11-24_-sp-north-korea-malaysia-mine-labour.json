    "content": "Malaysia has defended the use of North Korean labourers in its mining industry, saying they are particularly good workers because of their dedication, strength and bravery. After a North Korean was among those killed in a mine explosion at the weekend, Malaysia\u2019s deputy home minister, Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar, told reporters that the men had been working legally under a special agreement between Pyongyang and authorities in the Malaysian state of Sarawak. \u201cWhen it comes to industries such as coal mines, the jobs are very dangerous and tough,\u201d Wan Junaidi said. \u201cNo local or Sarawakian will dare to take up such jobs \u2014 that is why [we] need foreign workers. In the coal-mining sector, only Britain, China and North Korea have highly-skilled workers.\u201d Defectors\u2019 groups claim there may be as many as 65,000 North Koreans currently working abroad \u2014 primarily in China, Russia, Mongolia and the Middle East \u2014 where they are sent to jobs in construction, forestry, factories, restaurants and mines. They have questioned the ethics of using North Korean workers, amid suggestions that their salaries are paid directly to the government in Pyongyang. The minister\u2019s comments come just two days after three men \u2014 Tun Tun Win, 36, from Burma; Kardianto, 38, from Indonesia; and Pang Chung-hyok, 29, from North Korea \u2014 were killed after a blast ripped through the mine on Saturday morning. Another 29 men were injured, seven of them from North Korea. Forty-nine of the 119 foreign workers at the Sarawak mine were North Koreans. North Korean labour is sought after in Sarawak state on Borneo island, which is the only place in Malaysia permitted to hire workers from the country. Peninsular Malaysia has no such privilege, Wan Junaidi said. The minister said the labourers had valid work and immigration permits and that the Malaysian government had given the go-ahead for their recruitment: \u201cThere are many people from communist countries working in our country and having businesses here,\u201d he added. \u201cAll we require is that they come here legally, work legally and stay free of trouble with our laws.\u201d Whether or not they are being paid for the work they do in Sarawak, however, is unclear. \u201cAlmost all of the wages of the workers sent abroad are remitted back to Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime,\u201d the defectors\u2019 organisation North Korea Strategy Centre claims. Some labourers receive 10 or 15% of their full wages, defectors say, as their salaries are sent straight to North Korean state-run agencies where they are then shared among the higher echelons of Pyongyang\u2019s government. One North Korean labourer working on a \u00a328bn construction site in Qatar, where the 86,000-seat stadium will host the 2022 World Cup final, recently told the Guardian that he hadn\u2019t seen a penny of his salary. \u201cI don\u2019t get paid \u2013 the company gets the money,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I go back to North Korea I\u2019ll get paid, I think.\u201d Malaysia was recently downgraded to the lowest tier on the US\u2019s Trafficking in Persons index, ranking it alongside North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.",
