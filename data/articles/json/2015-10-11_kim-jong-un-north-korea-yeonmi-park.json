    "content": "A young North Korean defector and human rights activist has urged the west to not consider dictator Kim Jong-un as a comic figure. \u201cPlease don\u2019t see Kim Jong Un as a joke,\u201d she told the Women in the World event in London. \u201cHe is killing millions of people.\u201d Yeonmi Park, a 22-year-old who fled to China before making it to South Korea, described the complete control the dictator had over her childhood. \u201cI believed my dear leader could read my mind, I thought if I thought a bad thing he could punish me,\u201d she said. Park, who has written about her childhood in a harrowing autobiography, was speaking ahead of Saturday\u2019s celebrations in Pyongyang for the 70th anniversary of the Korean Workers\u2019 Party. At a lavish military parade, Kim said that his country was ready to counter any threat posed by the United States. Park urged the audience in London to not to take their freedoms for granted. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not a joke. This [the west] is a paradise; it is a heaven,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is a criminal, he is killing millions there, I hope we see him as not a joke.\u201d She gave an insight into the repression and fear that North Koreans continue to live under. \u201cI grew up with fear. My mother told me not to whisper because the birds and mice might hear you,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of all we are hungry, we don\u2019t have the luxury of [thinking about] anything else apart from surviving,\u201d adding that at one point she and her sister resorted to eating grasshoppers and dragon flies because there was no more rice. When she was 13 she urged her mother to flee to China, after secretly watching Chinese television as a child. \u201cI went for a bowl of rice,\u201d she said. She told the audience that the first thing she saw was her mother being raped. Once in the country, she was sold as a worker for $260; her mother was sold for $65. \u201cThe man who bought me couldn\u2019t feed us, so it was better to sell her to someone who could feed her,\u201d she said. Age of 15 she crossed the Gobi desert into Mongolia, to reach South Korea. \u201cI followed the northern stars to freedom,\u201d she said. In a rare light moment she described being bewildered by escalators, not understanding why the ground was moving. \u201cWhen I arrived, everything was shining,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to the toilet and the toilet paper had a flower on it, it smelt so good I thought I\u2019m not going to use it for this reason. It was so pretty.\u201d She then became a \u201clearning machine\u201d, she added. \u201cI learnt about the universe. I learnt about human rights and human dignity \u2013 this was so new to me. Freedom meant for me to wear earrings, not freedom of speech. I don\u2019t think I will ever understand what freedom means, but I am enjoying learning.\u201d",
