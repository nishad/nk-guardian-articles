    "content": "Malcolm Turnbull has said he is \u201cof one mind\u201d with Donald Trump\u2019s condemnation of North Korea\u2019s reckless conduct, after a \u201cvery warm\u201d 30-minute phone conversation with the US president on Wednesday morning. Turnbull told a media conference in Canberra the best avenue to avert conflict remained \u201cenforcement of strong economic sanctions\u201d but refused to comment on what other steps Trump might be contemplating to tackle Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime. The phone call followed warnings from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that the escalating crisis could cause a \u201cplanetary catastrophe\u201d and from the US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, that North Korea is \u201cbegging for war\u201d. Turnbull said the half-hour phone call was \u201ca very warm\u201d and constructive discussion. \u201cWe are absolutely of the one mind in condemning this reckless conduct,\u201d he said. \u201cWe discussed the importance of the full enforcement of the current sanctions regime and the importance of additional sanctions which, of course, are under consideration at the moment, being imposed in the future.\u201d Turnbull said China had \u201cthe greatest leverage by far\u201d and Australia would continue to encourage China \u201cto bring more economic pressure to bear on North Korea to bring this regime to its senses\u201d. Guardian Australia understands Turnbull agreed with the US position, expressed by Haley at the UN, that \u201cthe can cannot be kicked down the road\u201d. Turnbull spoke to Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, last week and Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, on Tuesday about the security crisis. \u201cEverybody wants to get this dangerous situation resolved, and bring this reckless, dangerous, provocative regime to its senses without conflict,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cA conflict would be catastrophic \u2013 everyone understands that. But the best avenue to achieve that, that we can see, is continued enforcement of strong economic sanctions, and, of course, the country with the biggest lever in that regard is China.\u201d Turnbull has strongly backed Trump\u2019s position on North Korea, committing earlier in August that \u201cif there is an attack on the US, the Anzus treaty would be invoked\u201d and Australia would come to the aid of the United States. Tensions have escalated in the past month after North Korea fired a missile over Japan, prompting Trump to warn of \u201cfire and fury\u201d in response, and North Korea\u2019s sixth atomic test, of a powerful hydrogen bomb. Trump has also tweeted that the US \u201cis considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,\u201d a threat to US trade with China that is not regarded as credible. Turnbull said he and Trump also discussed the battle against Islamic State, including in the Philippines. The leaders agreed that Isis cannot be allowed to obtain a foothold in south-east Asia. Australia and the United States are providing assistance to the Philippines government to clear the Isis insurgency out of Marawi, he said. Earlier this week Turnbull dismissed reports that Australian special forces have been offered to help the Philippine government. Turnbull said he had also extended sympathy to Trump over recent floods and hurricane damage in the US. Earlier on Wednesday the defence minister, Marise Payne, who will attend the sixth Seoul defence dialogue to discuss the threat of North Korea, said that Australia was attempting to avoid a war involving North Korea and the US \u201cat all costs\u201d. Asked about America\u2019s warning that Kim Jong-un is \u201cbegging for war\u201d and whether a miscalculation could lead to conflict, Payne replied: \u201cTo avoid the potential of such a problem, the emphasis must be on pursuing the effectiveness of the sanction regime, pursued through the UN security council.\u201d \u201cA number of those sanctions are only now in the process of coming into effect \u2026 they need to be allowed to operate,\u201d she said. Asked about her trip to the Philippines, Payne warned of returning foreign fighters and ISIS affiliates gaining a foothold in south-east Asia but did not give any further details about Australia\u2019s contribution.",
