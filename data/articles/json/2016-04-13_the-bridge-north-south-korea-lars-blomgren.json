    "content": "The man behind Scandinavian drama The Bridge has revealed that he is considering a version of the hit cross-border series set in North and South Korea. Describing himself as a man from a \u201cvery naive country\u201dLars Blomgren, the Swedish founder and managing director of the show\u2019s producers Filmlance, said he still hoped for a North-South Korean version, and would be prepared to compromise on his preference for working with producers and broadcasters on both sides of a border. \u201cI think it is important it works on both sides of the border, with one exception,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had serious discussions about North and South Korea, but then that won\u2019t involve anyone from the North Korean side. It would be fantastic to do. I would love to do it.\u201d Blomgren talked about how plans to film a version set in Russia and Ukraine were scuppered by hostilities between the two neighbours after he began exploring the idea of an eastern European version in 2012. \u201cWe had 14 different offers from production companies and broadcasters, from both Ukraine and Russia, we also had people suggesting Russia-Finland, Russia-Poland, Russia-Norway, several directions,\u201d Blomgren told the Guardian. \u201cThe most interesting creatively was Ukraine-Russia and there were some really prominent, good, high-quality people involved. That was what we are aiming for.\u201d However, conflict between the two countries and the eventual annexation of the Crimea by Russia in 2014 put the brakes on Filmlance\u2019s plans. The final nail in the coffin came in April last year when the Ukrainian government banned the positive depiction of Russian police or military on TV. \u201cWhen this conflict escalated \u2013 this is the catch \u2013 Ukrainian TV decided they would ban any scripted show with Russian policeman or military on screen, so end of story,\u201d said Blomgren. The original verrsion of The Bridge starred Sofia Helin as Swedish detective Saga Nor\u00e9n investigating cases straddling the country\u2019s border with Denmark, alongside Danish colleagues. It has proved a hit with audiences in part because of its backdrop of cultural differences, and a fourth series is expected to be commissioned within weeks. Filmlance owner Endemol Shine have already successfully transplanted the format, with Anglo-French production The Tunnel returning for a second series on French broadcaster Canal+, as well as Sky in April. Blomgren said finding a Russian version of the show that worked was made more difficult by the country\u2019s unbalanced relationship with its neighbours. \u201cThere was an interesting conversation with one of the big broadcasters, and I said \u2018maybe you should go for a more equal neighbour\u2019 and he said \u2018we don\u2019t have any equal neighbours\u2019,\u201d he said. However, he said Filmlance is now hoping the complex relationship between Russia and Estonia, which hosts many Russians who moved there during the Soviet era, will provide a compelling setting for a new series. \u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting border to aim for, and the only thing I keep arguing is I\u2019d love to do it as long as we have an Estonian broadcaster on board \u2026 it has to be as good on both sides of the border.\u201d Blomgren said he believed the cross-border approach has the potential to help ease the cultural tensions that help create drama in The Bridge format. \u201cI am from a country where we haven\u2019t had a war for 200 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a show that works on both sides of the border, of course it could help relations, but as I said I am from a very naive country.\u201d",
