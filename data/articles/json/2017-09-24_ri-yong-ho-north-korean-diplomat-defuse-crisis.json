    "content": "Over the past few days, one man has emerged as the international face of the North Korean regime: Ri Yong-ho. As the brickbats continued to fly between Washington and Pyongyang at the weekend, the North Korean foreign minister threatened to upstage his country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, with a mixture of trademark rhetoric and humour at the UN general assembly in New York. Ri took to the podium to deliver a fiery speech on behalf of Kim, who has not set foot outside of North Korea since he became leader in late 2011. In a rebuke to Donald Trump\u2019s threat to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if it attacked the US or its allies, he told the hall that it was now \u201call the more inevitable\u201d that the regime\u2019s rockets would \u201cvisit\u201d the US mainland. Borrowing the US president\u2019s own words, Ri added that it was the Trump, not Kim, who was on a suicide mission. In a brief encounter with journalists on his arrival in New York last week, Ri ridiculed Trump and showed flashes of humour. He likened Trump\u2019s threat to destroy North Korea to the \u201csound of a dog barking\u201d, and when asked for his opinion of the president\u2019s \u201crocket man\u201d nickname for Kim, simply replied: \u201cI feel sorry for his aides.\u201d On Saturday, he referred to Trump as \u201cPresident Evil\u201d. It was the second time in several days that Ri \u2013 not to be confused with a former senior army official of the same name who was reportedly purged in 2012 \u2013 had generated headlines around the world. Although he has been foreign minister for little over a year, his role is quickly coming to resemble that of Saddam Hussein\u2019s mouthpiece during both Gulf wars, Tariq Aziz. Like Aziz, Ri is highly visible \u2013 at least by North Korean standards \u2013 and is trusted to do his leader\u2019s bidding on an almost entirely hostile diplomatic stage. Ri\u2019s assured demeanour in New York can be attributed to a career spent at the heart of the North Korean political elite and almost two decades of dealing with the US, the UN and South Korea. Despite his penchant for the kind of bellicose language usually associated with North Korea\u2019s propaganda machine, Ri cut his cloth as a diplomat rather than as a provocateur. He was involved in North Korea\u2019s ill-fated negotiations with the US over its nuclear weapons programme in the mid-1990s. Later, he was chief negotiator for North Korea during six-party denuclearisation talks that have been stalled for almost a decade. It is hard to imagine any North Korean government official better placed to steer his country through the current crisis, particularly given his close ties to Kim. Ri, who is thought to be in his early 60s, has held several senior diplomatic posts, including as ambassador to Britain from 2003-07, and has travelled on missions to the US and Asia, according to North Korea Leadership Watch. As recently as last month, he met foreign ministers of South Korea, Russia and China \u2013 but not Japan or the US \u2013 on the sidelines of the Asean Regional Forum in Manila. Ri was destined to play a key role in the dynastic regime that has ruled North Korea for almost 70 years. He is the the son of Ri Myong-je, a former editor of the state KCNA news agency who also served as deputy chief of staff to Kim Jong-il. He attended the elite Namsan senior middle school and studied English at Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies. In 2000, Ri accompanied Jo Myong-rok, who was then first vice-chairman of North Korea\u2019s National Defence Commission, on a trip to the US, where he met Bill Clinton and the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright. Having personally contributed to raising diplomatic tensions over the past week, could Ri also be the person to help defuse the crisis? Writing in the Atlantic last week, Joel S Wit, a senior fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, suggested that a meeting between Ri and the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, could break the \u201ccounterproductive cycle of escalation\u201d between Washington and Pyongyang. \u201cRi is not a typical communist bureaucrat,\u201d Wit wrote. \u201cHe has impressive diplomatic skills. Smart, thoughtful, and articulate, he is a careful listener who often asks perceptive questions and chooses his responses with care. He can be both reasonable in trying to understand the other country\u2019s point of view and tough in defending North Korea\u2019s interests. Moreover, he is clearly \u2018connected\u2019.\u201d",
