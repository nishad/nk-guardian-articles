    "content": "Kim Jong-un is back on the scene. Since emerging from a two-month absence (apparently due to ankle surgery), he has given field guidance to a new restaurant, advised the Korean Workers Party on the best soil for feeding livestock and got the feel for an airforce jet. He also found time to visit an orphanage with candy-pink bunk beds surrounded by soft toys. But there is something amiss: look carefully and you\u2019ll notice the great leader smoking a cigarette. It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s been snapped having a puff on official business but does doing it in a children\u2019s home send the wrong message? Tell us how you\u2019d caption this photo in the comments below.",
