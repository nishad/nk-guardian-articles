    "content": "In a dramatic change, the most shocking response to North Korea\u2019s 3 July missile test \u2013 which some analysts think demonstrates Pyongyang\u2019s ability to strike Alaska or Hawaii with a ballistic missile \u2013 came not from Donald Trump, but from Beijing and Moscow. Trump\u2019s Twitter response to the launch contained his typical combination of bluster, insult and prodding. \u201cDoes this guy have anything better to do with his life,\u201d Trump said on 3 July, probably referring to the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, adding, \u201cperhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!\u201d By a happy coincidence for the two countries, the launch occurred during Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to Moscow. Hours before the launch, the Chinese Communist party secretary told Russian media that Sino-Russian strategic ties \u201care at the best point in history\u201d, and the launch offered the two sides an occasion to demonstrate their closeness. In a joint statement, China and Russia\u2019s foreign ministries warned the situation on the Korean peninsula was so tense \u201cit could lead to an armed conflict\u201d. And it chastised the \u201crelevant parties\u201d \u2013 Trump, as well as Kim \u2013 to \u201crefrain from provocative actions and warlike remarks\u201d. The striking thing about their statement is not only the language \u2013 mild when compared with Trump\u2019s tweets, but surprisingly strident from China\u2019s normally staid foreign ministry \u2013 but that Moscow and Beijing took the unusual step of issuing one together. Since coming to power following the death of his father in December 2011, Kim has increased the frequency of his isolated nation\u2019s missile tests, nuclear tests and provocations. Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has claimed the White House will discard Barack Obama\u2019s policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d: inaction coupled with regional diplomacy and sanctions. And yet, as North Korea\u2019s military capabilities have grown over the last six months, Trump has neglected to announce a new, concrete strategy for dealing with North Korea. One thing he has done, however, may have more dangerous strategic consequences for the US: his bungling North Korea strategy has helped pushed Beijing closer to Moscow. There are two main reasons why this has happened. The first is that Trump\u2019s public pressure on Beijing highlights how China\u2019s strategic goals for the Hermit Kingdom overlap with Russia\u2019s \u2013 and how they differ from the United States. Xi and Trump share the quixotic desire for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and the equally unrealistic wish for Kim to act with more predictability and restraint. The similarities basically end there. Washington wants the peninsula unified under Seoul. Moscow and Beijing both appreciate North Korea\u2019s existence as a buffer state between their countries and the democratic, western-leaning South Korea, which houses roughly 29,500 US troops. While North Korea\u2019s largest northern border is with China, it also shares an important border with Russia. In pushing for sanctions, Washington wants to economically strangle North Korea. Beijing and Moscow prefer economic engagement. In late January, Russia and North Korea reportedly discussed expanding rail links between the two nations, and in March, Moscow expanded a guest worker program that brings North Korean laborers to Russia. China\u2019s trade with North Korea in the first quarter of 2017 reportedly grew an astonishing 37.4% from the same period last year. Indeed, the natural overlap is so striking that in a May 2017 speech, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China and Russia \u201cshare a highly consistence stance\u201d on the Korean peninsula. These shared interests played into the two sides\u2019 decision to issue a joint statement. In their statement, they called on Pyongyang to halt its missile and nuclear tests, and for the United States and South Korea to stop its large-scale military exercise \u2013 which Washington says is defensive, but Pyongyang sees as preparation for an invasion. The second way Trump\u2019s North Korea policy pushes Beijing closer to Moscow concerns Trump\u2019s stance towards China\u2019s sovereignty. Each time Trump publicly asks, cajoles, or threatens Beijing about North Korea, he implies a lack of respect for Xi\u2019s rule. Moreover, Beijing has long seen North Korea as a client state: it will not allow the United States to dictate Beijing\u2019s foreign policy strategy towards its neighbor. Each time Trump publicly broaches the issue, it raises the costs for Xi to gracefully yield. There is less ambiguity between China and its northern neighbor: though Moscow sometimes resents it, Russia is clearly the junior partner in the relationship. Instead of finding common cause with Washington in the wake of Pyongyang\u2019s latest test, Beijing turned to Moscow. The reasons for an improvement of Sino-Soviet ties extend beyond North Korea. Despite Russian President Vladmir Putin\u2019s bizarrely warm relationship with Trump, both Moscow and Beijing find the American-led international framework problematic: they seek to expand their influence over or subvert current international institutions, while at the same time creating alternative ones. Both countries resent US meddling in Syria. And they\u2019ve recently improved military relations \u2013 Beijing recently purchased Russian high-tech military equipment, and the two sides have expanded the \u201cgeographic scope of Sino-Russian military exercises\u201d according to a March 2017 US government report. Yes, the report adds, \u201cpolicy differences and mutual distrust\u201d mean a near-term military alliance is unlikely. In the 1950s, the last time Beijing and Moscow were this close, the Soviet Union\u2019s global reach threatened the United States \u2013 but China was shambolic, and desperately poor. Now, China is the world\u2019s second-most influential country, while Russia maintains its status as regional power. If the two sides keep expanding their common interests, that could be far more devastating to the United States\u2019 long-term interests than Kim and his missiles.",
