    "content": "The false alarm about a ballistic missile strike that terrified Hawaiians on Saturday showed Donald Trump\u2019s policy on North Korea is wrong, a Democratic US representative from the state said on Sunday. \u201cWhat makes me angry,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told CNN\u2019s State of the Union, \u201cis that, yes, this false alarm went out and we have to fix that in Hawaii but really we\u2019ve got to get to the underlying issue here, of why are the people of Hawaii and the US facing a nuclear threat coming from North Korea? \u201cAnd what is this president doing, urgently, to eliminate that threat?\u201d Trump was on the golf course in Florida when the alert went out on Saturday morning, Hawaiian time. The alert text read: \u201cBallistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.\u201d \u201cIt was definitely kind of a panic zone,\u201d Ashley Trask, 39 and from Kauai, told the Guardian. \u201cEveryone knows you have about 15 minutes until detonation and no one knows where it will land.\u201d Family members \u201ccalled us and they were crying because they realized they wouldn\u2019t have made it to us\u201d, Trask said. Beth Ann Brooks of Haleiwa said she and her husband sheltered in their bathroom with their children. \u201cThe fear I felt was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d she said. It took 38 minutes for state authorities to send a second message saying the alert was an error. Governor David Ige told CNN the false alarm was \u201ca mistake made during a standard procedure at the change over of a shift, and an employee pushed the wrong button\u201d. On Sunday, Gabbard said \u201c\u2018traumatic\u2019 understates the experience that the people of Hawaii went through\u201d and added that the person responsible for the alert should be held accountable. Hawaii Emergency Management Agency administrator Vern Miyagi said he took responsibility and officials would study the error. Ajit Pai, chair of the Federal Communications Commission Chairman, said he would launch an investigation. As tension between the Trump White House and nuclear-armed Pyongyang has risen, Trump trading public insults with Kim Jong-un and bragging about the size of his \u201cnuclear button\u201d, fears that North Korea could reach US territory with a nuclear weapon have surged. \u201cHawaii has just started a few months ago these monthly nuclear attack sirens as a test,\u201d Gabbard said, \u201ctelling people, \u2018You hear the siren, you\u2019ve got 15 minutes to seek shelter.\u2019\u201d \u201cSo people who got this message yesterday, they\u2019re literally going through this feeling of, \u2018I\u2019ve got minutes to find my loved ones, to say my last goodbyes, to figure out where I could possibly find shelter that will protect them from a nuclear attack.\u2019 And not having an answer to those questions. \u201cThis was unacceptable that it happened but it really highlights the stark reality that the people of Hawaii are facing.\u201d Gabbard, a military veteran and member of the House armed services and foreign affairs committees, added: \u201cI\u2019ve been calling on President Trump to negotiate directly with North Korea, to sit across the table from Kim Jong-un, work out the differences so that we can build a pathway towards denuclearisation, to remove this threat.\u201d There should be no preconditions to such talks, Gabbard said, which meant that North Korea should not have to give up its nuclear weapons first as the US demands. Washington should assure Pyongyang it is not pursuing regime change, she said. The White House responded to the false alarm by releasing a statement that said Trump had been briefed. The statement also placed blame on Hawaii, saying the alarm was \u201cpurely a state exercise\u201d. Brian Schatz, a Democratic US senator from Hawaii, said on Saturday \u201cthis system failed miserably and we need to start over\u201d and added that he would work with the US military\u2019s Pacific command \u201con an after-action process to make sure that this process gets fixed\u201d. \u201cThis is a state responsibility but we will take collective action,\u201d Schatz tweeted. The homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, told Fox News Sunday the error was \u201cvery unfortunate\u201d. People should still abide by such alerts, she said. Trump mentioned North Korea and Kim on Sunday morning, but only in the context of a tweet complaining of a complaint about an alleged reporting error by a mainstream news outlet. \u201cThe Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them \u2018I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un\u201d (of N. Korea),\u2019\u201d the president wrote. \u201cObviously I didn\u2019t say that. I said \u2018I\u2019d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,\u2019 a big difference. \u201cFortunately we now record conversations with reporters and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!\u201d The Journal interview was published on Thursday, under the headline \u201cDonald Trump Signals Openness to North Korea Diplomacy in Interview\u201d. According to the transcript published on the paper\u2019s website, Trump said: \u201cI probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.\u201d Trump was asked if he had spoken to Kim. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on it,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I have or haven\u2019t. I just don\u2019t want to comment.\u201d A White House official told Reuters on Sunday the delay in publicly disputing the Journal\u2019s account was caused by a failed attempt to get the paper to correct its story.
