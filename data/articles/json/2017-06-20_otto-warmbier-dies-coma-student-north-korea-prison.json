    "content": "Otto Warmbier, the 22-year-old student who was returned to the US in a coma last week after 17 months as a prisoner in North Korea, has died in a Cincinnati hospital, his parents announced. \u201cIt is our sad duty to report that our son, Otto Warmbier, has completed his journey home. Surrounded by his loving family, Otto died today at 2.20pm,\u201d Fred and Cindy Warmbier wrote in a statement on Monday. They added that his death had been inevitable as a result of \u201cthe awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans\u201d. Warmbier was arrested at Pyongyang airport in January 2016 and sentenced in March to 15 years hard labour for allegedly taking a propaganda poster from his hotel room, where he had been staying as part of an organised tour. The University of Virginia student wept at his sentencing, saying: \u201cI have made the worst mistake of my life.\u201d The trial reportedly lasted less than an hour. He was medically evacuated from North Korea last Tuesday and flown to the US. Doctors from the University of Cincinnati medical centre, where Warmbier was taken, said he had suffered injuries related to cardiopulmonary arrest and was in a state of unresponsive wakefulness. Scans showed extensive loss in all regions of Warmbier\u2019s brain. \u201cWhen Otto returned to Cincinnati late on 13 June he was unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands,\u201d his parents said in their statement. \u201cHe looked very uncomfortable \u2013 almost anguished. Although we would never hear his voice again, within a day the countenance of his face changed \u2013 he was at peace. He was home and we believe he could sense that.\u201d The Warmbier family thanked the doctors for their efforts on Monday but added: \u201cUnfortunately, the awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today.\u201d \u201cIt would be easy at a moment like this to focus on all that we lost \u2013 future time that won\u2019t be spent with a warm, engaging, brilliant young man whose curiosity and enthusiasm for life knew no bounds,\u201d the Warmbiers\u2019 statement said. \u201cBut we choose to focus on the time we were given to be with this remarkable person.\u201d Speaking at a public event on Friday, Donald Trump took credit on behalf of his administration for getting Warmbier back. \u201cLet me start by saying that I\u2019m glad Secretary of State of Rex Tillerson and I, along with a very talented team, were able to get Otto Warmbier back with his parents,\u201d Trump said in a speech in Miami. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to him is a truly terrible thing, but at least the ones who love him so much can now take care of him and be with him.\u201d Commenting on Warmbier\u2019s death on Monday, President Trump said: \u201cLot of bad things happened, but at least we got him home to be with his parents.\u201d Speaking during a White House event, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s a brutal regime and we\u2019ll be able to handle it.\u201d In a statement later, Trump offered his condolences to Warmbier\u2019s parents, and said: \u201cOtto\u2019s fate deepens my Administration\u2019s determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency.\u201d John McCain, the Republican senator, accused North Korea of murdering Warmbier. Republican senator Rob Portman, who is from Cincinnati, said North Korea should be \u201cuniversally condemned for its abhorrent behavior\u201d. Democratic senator Sherrod Brown said the country\u2019s \u201cdespicable actions \u2026 must be condemned\u201d. Portman added that the Warmbiers have \u201chad to endure more than any family should have to bear\u201d. Three Americans remain held in North Korea. The US government accuses North Korea of using such detainees as political pawns. North Korea accuses Washington and South Korea of sending spies to overthrow its government. Human Rights Watch said Warmbier\u2019s death \u201cafter being abused in North Korean custody\u201d proved the regime was willing to \u201cbrutalize and kill to maintain their hold on power.\u201d Phil Robertson, deputy director of the group\u2019s Asia division said: \u201cNorth Korea again reaffirmed its position as one of the worst human rights abusing governments in the world.\u201d Young Pioneer Tours, the travel company that took Warmbier to North Korea, has said it will no longer take US citizens into the country because \u201cthe risk is too high\u201d.",
