    "content": "The US president, Donald Trump, said on Saturday a meeting with North Korea could happen over the next three to four weeks. \u201cI think we will have a meeting over the next three or four weeks,\u201d Trump said at a campaign rally in Washington, Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s going be a very important meeting, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019ll see how it goes,\u201d he added. \u201cI may go in, it may not work out, I leave.\u201d No date has been announced for a meeting and there has been intense speculation on the location of the summit, with possible hosts including Singapore, Mongolia and South Korea. Mike Pompeo, the new US secretary of state, said Kim was \u201cprepared to ... lay out a map that would help us achieve\u201d denuclearisation. Pompeo described his secret metting Kim over Easter weekend as a \u201cgood conversation\u201d, adding the North Korean leader was \u201cvery well prepared\u201d. \u201cWe had an extensive conversation on the hardest issues that face our two countries,\u201d he said in an interview with ABC News that will air on Sunday in the US. \u201cI had a clear mission statement from President Trump. When I left Kim Jong-un understood the mission exactly as I described it today.\u201d North and South Korea agreed to a common goal at a summit on Friday of \u201ccomplete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula\u201d, but many experts are wary of what Kim may demand in return for relinquishing his arsenal. But in a sign Pyongyang may be seriously considering giving up its nuclear stockpile, North Korean state media reported on the summit\u2019s joint declaration calling for \u201ccomplete denuclearisation\u201d. It was a rare admission of the North\u2019s commitments to the international community in a country where information is tightly controlled and highly scripted. Dozens of photos of the meeting filled North Korea\u2019s main newspaper and the summit was given primetime coverage on state television. Trump also spoke with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, by phone and they agreed North Korea\u2019s future was dependent on \u201ccomplete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation\u201d. The two also said a meeting between Trump and Kim should be held \u201cas soon as possible to maintain momentum for the success of the summit\u201d, according to South Korea\u2019s presidential office. Trump said Moon and Kim had a \u201cvery good meeting\u201d, and took credit for the historic summit, during which the leader of North Korea entered the South for the first time since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. The US president also took credit for the inter-Korean meeting, as well as saying Moon had praised his actions in making the summit possible. \u201cI had one of the fake news groups this morning. They were saying, \u2018what do you think President Trump had to do with it?\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. Like, how about everything?\u201d The US defence secretary, James Mattis, also held a phone discussion with his South Korean counterpart and reaffirmed \u201cthe ironclad US commitment\u201d to defend its ally \u201cusing the full spectrum of US capabilities\u201d. Trump also spoke with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe about \u201cthe ongoing negotiations\u201d for a meeting with Kim. The leaders of North and South Korea pledged at their meeting to to push for a formal end to the Korean war, which would require joint talks with the US and China, with a peace treaty to replace the uneasy truce that stopped hostilities.
