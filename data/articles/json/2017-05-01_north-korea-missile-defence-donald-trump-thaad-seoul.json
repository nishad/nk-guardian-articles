    "content": "The South Korean media has accused Donald Trump of weakening bilateral security ties at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula after he said Seoul should pay for a controversial missile defence system. The US president was accused of dropping \u201ca barrage of verbal bombs\u201d and sending \u201cconfusing and contradictory\u201d messages over Washington\u2019s commitment to the country\u2019s security. In an interview last week, Trump said that South Korea - a key US ally in the Asia-Pacific \u2013 should foot the $1bn (\u00a3770m) bill for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (Thaad) antimissile system currently being deployed in the South Korean countryside. \u201cI informed South Korea it would be appropriate if they paid. It\u2019s a billion-dollar system,\u201d Trump was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. \u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal, shoots missiles right out of the sky.\u201d However, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, HR McMaster, reportedly told his South Korean counterpart on Sunday that the US would shoulder the costs for the system, which is designed to intercept North Korean missiles in mid-flight. The leading Chosun Ilbo newspaper said Trump was placing domestic financial concerns above regional security, at a time when North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes were causing alarm among its neighbours. \u201cTrump\u2019s mouth rattling Korea-US alliance,\u201d it said in a front-page headline. \u201cThere are issues that are far more important than just money,\u201d it said in an editorial. \u201cIf either country keeps reducing the alliance to the matter of money or the economy, it is bound to undermine basic trust.\u201d Another major newspaper, JoongAng Ilbo, accused Trump\u2019s administration of sending \u201cconfusing and contradictory messages\u201d, creating a \u201cchaotic situation\u201d that dealt a \u201chuge blow\u201d to the bilateral alliance. \u201cThe US must be well aware of the pain and backlash Seoul has endured to push for the Thaad deployment,\u201d it added. A headline on the front page of Dong-A Ilbo read: \u201cTrump risk: we need to come up with new strategy for Korea-US alliance\u201d. The paper accused Trump of dropping \u201ca barrage of verbal bombs\u201d on South Korea in a challenge to its next president. \u201cWe hope that Trump will be more careful with his words,\u201d it said in an editorial. \u201cWho\u2019s going to smile if our alliance is shaken? It will be North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un and China\u2019s Xi Jinping.\u201d An adviser to Moon Jae-in, the frontrunner in South Korea\u2019s presidential election to be held on 9 May, described Trump\u2019s demand as impossible. Kim Ki-jung, who advises Moon on foreign policy, said: \u201cEven if we purchase Thaad, its main operation would be in the hands of the United States. So buying it would be an impossible option.\u201d Moon, a liberal who wants to reopen dialogue with North Korea, has said he will review Thaad if he wins the election, but has stopped short of promising to scrap it. The Pentagon has said Thaad will be operational \u201cvery soon\u201d, despite strong objections from China, which claims the system\u2019s powerful radar could penetrate its territory and would do little to dissuade North Korea from attempting to develop nuclear-armed ballistic missiles capable of striking the US mainland. \u201c[Thaad] is moving very quickly; it will have initial operational capability very soon,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis told reporters last week. Washington\u2019s position on which country should pay for Thaad is still unclear, however, with McMaster suggesting that payment was still up for negotiation. \u201cThe relationship on Thaad, on our defence relationship going forward, will be renegotiated, as it\u2019s going to be with all of our allies,\u201d he told Fox News on Sunday. The US and South Korea originally agreed that Washington would pay for Thaad in return for South Korea providing land for missile batteries, radar and other facilities.",
