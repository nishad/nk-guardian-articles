    "content": "In the wake of the massive hack that has seen more than 250GB of private files shared online, Sony Pictures is successfully cracking down on discussion of its stolen data on sites such as Reddit. The social news site has deleted posts, blocked individual user accounts, and banned a subreddit devoted to sharing the files, after takedown notices from the film company. At the core of the deletions, prompted by a takedown notice from Sony citing the American Digital Millennium Copyright Act, was the SonyGOP subreddit. Before the takedown, it served as a hub of discussion around the files, but also as a depository for download links to the content \u2013 which remains, strictly speaking, Sony\u2019s copyrighted material. SonyGOP is now returning a \u201csubreddit banned\u201d notice, and the moderator of the page (a throwaway account also named SonyGOP) has also had their account deleted. Reddit told Business Insider\u2019s James Cook that \u201cdiscussions and news stories\u201d about the hack were still allowed on the site. The removal of SonyGOP has echoes of Reddit\u2019s previous removal of the subreddit TheFappening, where Redditors congregated to share and discuss photos stolen from celebrities\u2019 iCloud accounts. The subreddit was also bombarded with DMCA takedown notices, but the lack of a single authority with ownership of all the material meant that Reddit didn\u2019t remove the whole subforum, instead policing it on a piecemeal basis. Eventually, however, it decreed that the subreddit as a whole fell foul of its rules on sharing personal data, and removed it. The takedowns on Reddit are the most successful example of Sony\u2019s legal campaign to suppress the dissemination of the stolen material. On Monday, the film company sent a legal letter to a number of news sites around the world, including the New York Times and Re/Code, demanding that they \u201cdestroy the stolen information\u201d. \u201cIf you do not comply with this request, and the stolen information is used or disseminated by you in any manner, Sony Pictures Entertainment will have no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination,\u201d the letter continued. Snapchat But despite the letters, the stories from the stolen data keep on coming. Thanks to the involvement of one Sony executive in the board of photo messaging app Snapchat, the hack has led to confirmation that the firm really did pass up a multibillion-dollar acquisition offer from Facebook. Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, a Snapchat board member, was asked over email by the New Yorker staffer Malcolm Gladwell whether the company really had turned down a $3bn offer. \u201cIf you knew the real number you would book us all a suite at Bellvue,\u201d was Lynton\u2019s reply. The firm\u2019s rejection of the buyout offer was seen by many in 2013 as evidence of Snapchat\u2019s hubris. But others compared it to Instagram, a company which accepted just $1bn to be acquired by Facebook and is now the same size as Twitter, which has a market cap of $23bn.",
