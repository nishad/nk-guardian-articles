    "content": "Cliffs of blue mirror glass plunge towards a waterfall, as space-age hoverships dock on glistening conical towers. Buildings shaped like spinning-tops nestle between lush mountainsides, connected by ski slopes, while a glass bubble train snakes through the valley. These could be scenes from a Dan Dare comic, showing the holiday hideouts of the Mekon and his chums. In fact, they are rare glimpses of how North Korean architects imagine their future. \u201cWe gave them a completely open brief to dream up designs for what tourism might be like in their country,\u201d says Nick Bonner, the Beijing-based curator and tour operator who commissioned the paintings, which are currently on show in the Korean Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale (which won the Golden Lion for best pavilion). \u201cWe asked them to go crazy, to see what they would come up with given absolutely no constraints.\u201d One scene shows plans for the Silk Co-operative, a high-tech, low-energy artisans' commune, with circular buildings modelled on traditional Korean spinning wheels and wrapped in blue solar panels. In between these mirrored discs stand towers topped with wind-turbines-cum-helipads, rising above a watery landscape. \u201cThe tourist benefits from being in the company of artisans, and the ability to learn new skills or just indulge in the beauty of the area,\u201d write the architects. \u201cThey can travel by river, solar-train, or helicopter, then go on mountain walks.\u201d It is a lavish dream in a country where transport is still limited and freedom of movement severely restricted. Despite the high-tech appearance of this new community, its architects are also keen to point out that the construction \u201cuses natural stone, not concrete\u201d \u2013 a strange claim, explained only by the fact that the country has yet to embrace reinforced steel. Oozing retro Jetsons-style glamour and sprinkled with curious anachronisms, the paintings provide a fascinating window on what contemporary architectural culture looks like in a place cut off from the world since 1948, a land immune from the churning feedback loop of design blogs and glossy magazines. It is a quaint vision of a future that never happened, employing forms and materials that smack of World Fairs gone by, or the sets of Thunderbirds. There are swathes of blue mirror-glass and bubble cable-cars, interiors lined with tangerine paint and brown veneer \u2013 all drenched in a decidedly 1970s flavour. There is a pink boudoir worthy of Lady Penelope, with a swooping ceiling and a moulded side table \u2013 on which an old-fashioned dial-up telephone sits. The general aesthetic is as if Bjarke Ingels had travelled back in time and worked as an apprentice to Frank Lloyd Wright, sci-fi cartoons inflected with a homely crafts sensibility. There are also underlying hints of the social values of the DPRK and Juche ideology of collective self-reliance established by Kim Il-sung. The Bird's Nest villa is designed as a communal retreat, a cluster of interconnected pagodas for group holidays and corporate team-bonding trips. \u201cWe all are in the nest together and have to learn to be together harmoniously,\u201d say the architects, explaining how the open interiors are \u201clight, airy and fun\u201d. Spurning the usual hotel corridor, the rooms are arranged around staggered atriums, \u201cto allow you to come into visual contact with your friends much more naturally, which aids communication.\u201d In the Democratic People's Republic, collective conviviality trumps solitude. Elsewhere, there is the Woodland Retreat, described as \u201can aerial hotel room where you are embraced by nature\u201d, which takes the form of a series of terraces held aloft on chunky columns \u2013 again hinting at the limits of North Korean structural possibility. Other designs are eerily prescient. There is a great bridge that mysteriously conflates two projects by Norman Foster (neither of which the architect would have seen), channelling the slender cable-stayed structure of the Millau Viaduct, in southern France, and the jaunty wobble of London's own Millennium Bridge. \u201cVisitors walk across the morning mist as if on clouds connecting mountains, [and] experience the feeling of flight,\u201d says the blurb. \u201c[It is] a different kind of experience using modern constructional material. There is slight vibration and sway like the Korean swing, so you know you are in the air.\u201d The paintings are a rare commission to have emerged from the notoriously secretive country, the result of four years' work by Bonner and his team. They have been produced by architects at the Paekdusan Construction and Architectural Research Institute, an anonymous machine from which most of the state's major projects are issued, by people trained at the country's main architecture school, the Pyongyang Construction and Building Material University. It is a place where architects are weaned not on Corb and Koolhaas, or Mies and Morphosis, but on a diet of ancient Korean buildings and socialist architecture with Korean influence, alongside classes in western classical architecture and proportion \u2013 and declarations from their late \u201cDear Leader,\u201d Kim Jong-Il. \u201cThere cannot and should not be a modern form of architecture that is devoid of national characteristics,\u201d writes Kim in his 1991 treatise, On Architecture, a 170-page guidebook-manifesto full of mangled aphorisms and strangely familiar archispeak. \u201cArchitecture that has been created to reflect the people's requirements in a new age, in keeping with the modern aesthetic feelings and modern civilised life,\u201d he adds, \u201cis architecture that embodies modernity, namely, modern architecture.\u201d Elsewhere, he appears to draw on the Vitruvian triad of \u201cfirmness, commodity and delight,\u201d declaring the four demands of the masses to be \u201cconvenience, cosiness, beauty and durability\u201d \u2013 although it is hard to say that many of the megalithic monuments over which he presided look all that cosy. So would he have approved of the buildings imagined here? Given the hypocrisy of his treatise, it's hard to tell. In one breath, he argues for the importance of originality, before summoning words that could come straight from Prince Charles' personal architectural manifesto: \u201cWe must combat and promptly do away with fame-seeking, formalism, art for art\u2019s sake, imitationism, and all the other unhealthy creative attitudes that find expression among architects.\u201d Whatever the case, given that Pyongyang now sports a glistening rocket-ship hotel, it can only be a matter of time before inhabited spinning wheels and high-tech tree-houses become reality. \u2022 Utopian Tours forms part of the Korean Pavilion, Crow's Eye View: the Korean Peninsula, at the Venice Biennale's Giardini, until Sunday 23 November. Koryo Tours is organising a seven-day architectural tour of North Korea in October. For more information and itinerary click here.",
