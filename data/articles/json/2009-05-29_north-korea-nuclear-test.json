    "content": "South Koreans shrugged off the threat of war from the North yesterday and focused on internal divisions brought into sharp relief by the death of a former president, Roh Moo-hyun. Seoul was last night awash with yellow, Roh's campaign colour, as an estimated 150,000 of his supporters turned up for his funeral and then protested in the city streets. They held placards proclaiming: \"Today condolences. Tomorrow anger.\" An anti-government demonstration is planned for Saturday. Roh leapt to his death from a cliff near his home last Saturday while under investigation for corruption. He left a note saying: \"The rest of my life would only be a burden for others.\" To his supporters he was the victim of a conservative witch-hunt. Weeping mourners booed when the current conservative president, Lee Myung-bak, was shown on television screens paying his respects to his liberal predecessor. The bitterness of the divide is partly driven by wide differences over how to deal with the North. Roh championed the \"sunshine policy\" of accommodation and visited North Korea in 2007 to meet Kim Jong-il. Lee, who took over 15 months ago, has taken a tougher line, but neither approach has stopped Pyongyang developing and testing nuclear weapons. The funeral came at the end of a week in which North Korea carried out its second nuclear test \u2013 this time an apparently successful one \u2013 and declared itself no longer bound by the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War, and threatened to attack the South if any of its ships were boarded in the search for weapons of mass destruction. US and South Korean troops are consequently on a higher state of alert, but the South Korean public has remained unruffled. \"Nobody is paying much attention,\" one official said. \"We remain calm. We try not to react to North Korean rhetoric. We have been living with it for such a long time.\"",
