    "content": "Donald Trump would invite the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, to the White House if next week\u2019s summit in Singapore is successful, the US president told reporters on Thursday. \u201cCertainly if it goes well, and I think it would be well received, I think he would look at it very favourably, so I think that could happen,\u201d Trump said at a joint press conference with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Asked whether such a meeting would happen at the White House or his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump replied: \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll start with the White House. What do you think?\u201d But speaking in bright sunshine in the White House rose garden, the president also struck a note of caution, repeating his warning that he is \u201ctotally prepared to walk away\u201d if the 12 June negotiations over denuclearisation break down. \u201cI did it once before,\u201d Trump said \u2013 presumably a reference to his letter that temporarily cancelled the meeting. \u201cI hope it won\u2019t be necessary to walk because I really believe that Kim Jong-un wants to do something that is going to be great for his people, and also great for his family and great for himself.\u201d Trump was asked if he and Kim could sign an agreement to end the Korean war after 65 years, and whether he would eventually like to normalise diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. \u201cWe could absolutely sign an agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it, we\u2019re talking about it with them, we\u2019re talking about it with a lot of other people, but that could happen, but that\u2019s really the beginning. Sounds a little bit strange, but that\u2019s probably the easy part. The hard part remains after that. \u201cNormalising relations is something that I would expect to do, I would hope to do when everything\u2019s complete \u2026 There are a lot of good factors lined up for North Korea, a lot of tremendous factors that give it tremendous potential. It has tremendous potential because the people are great and we would certainly like to see normalisation, yes.\u201d Last week Trump admitted he is no longer using the term \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to describe sanctions against North Korea but warned that more could be imposed. On Thursday, he explained: \u201cMaximum pressure is absolutely in effect. We don\u2019t use the term any more because we\u2019re going into a friendly negotiation. \u201cPerhaps after that negotiation I will be using it again. You\u2019ll know how well we do at the negotiation: if you hear me saying we\u2019re going to use \u2018maximum pressure\u2019, you\u2019ll know the negotiation did not do well, frankly.\u201d No sanctions have been removed, he added, and there is a list of 300 further sanctions, some \u201cmassive\u201d, that he has put on hold \u201cuntil we can make a deal\u201d. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be necessary but we will soon know.\u201d He drew comparison with Iran, which he claimed is \u201cacting a lot differently\u201d since he tore up Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear deal and imposed stiff sanctions. \u201cThey\u2019re a much different country over the last three months.\u201d For his part, Abe said Trump \u201cfully understands\u201d the need to bring home at least a dozen Japanese citizens held by North Korea. Trump \u201cis one of the leaders who understands the issue the most, the greatest\u201d, he added. Abe, who has travelled to the US twice in the past two months in an attempt to keep the abductions on Trump\u2019s agenda, said he would be willing to meet Kim. \u201cI wish to directly face North Korea and talk with them so that the abduction problem can be resolved quickly,\u201d he said. North Korea abducted at least a dozen Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s and used them to teach their language and customs to the regime\u2019s spies. Trump said Abe had talked \u201cpassionately\u201d about the abductees\u2019 plight during their meeting. \u201cHe talked about it long and hard and passionately and I will follow his wishes and we will be discussing that with North Korea absolutely, absolutely,\u201d Trump said. Abe said resolving the abductions would pave the way for the normalisation of diplomatic ties between Pyongyang and Tokyo, as well as economic cooperation. He added that Japan wanted to see \u201creal peace in north-east Asia\u201d, but added that progress was contingent on North Korea\u2019s willingness to take steps towards a \u201cbright future\u201d. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, admitted the regime had snatched Japanese citizens during a 2002 summit in Pyongyang with the then Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Five of the victims returned to Japan with their families, but Pyongyang insists the rest either died or never entered North Korea. Trump\u2019s critics worry that he is improvising his way through the negotiations and could be outsmarted. Last week, he was widely mocked for telling reporters that an oversized letter he received from Kim was \u201cvery nice\u201d then admitting, moments later, he had not yet read it. Asked on Thursday about the contents of the letter, the president replied: \u201cThe letter was just a greeting. It was really very nice. Perhaps I can get approval to put it out \u2026 Nothing other than we look forward to seeing you and we look forward to the summit and hopefully some wonderful things will work out, so it was really very warm, very nice.\u201d Earlier, in the Oval Office, Trump, who reportedly resists reading briefing documents, claimed that he does not need to do much homework before the summit. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have to prepare very much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about attitude. It\u2019s about willingness to get things done.\u201d Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, tweeted in response: \u201cWith ICBMs and nuclear warheads in the hands of North Korea, the situation is far too dangerous for seat-of-the-pants negotiating.\u201d But Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, insisted that Trump has been receiving near daily briefings on all aspects of the situation and the history of the relationship. \u201cI am very confident the president will be fully prepared when he meets his North Korean counterpart,\u201d he told reporters at the White House. Complete, verifiable denuclearisation is the only acceptable outcome, Pompeo said, and if North Korea does not move in the right direction, the current punitive measures will increase. \u201cYou can be sure President Trump will not stand for a bad deal,\u201d he said. Questioned about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s recent claim that Kim was \u201cbegging on hands and knees\u201d for the meeting, Pompeo said: \u201cRudy doesn\u2019t speak for the administration when it comes to this negotiation and this set of issues.\u201d He also acknowledged that he and John Bolton, the national security adviser, disagree from time to time. The secretary was asked if the gap between US and North Korea\u2019s definitions of denuclearisation had narrowed. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. Could he elaborate? \u201cNo.\u201d",
