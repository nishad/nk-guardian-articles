    "content": "The crew of a Cathay Pacific flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong reported seeing a North Korean ballistic missile break up and fall out of the sky last week, the airline has said, highlighting an unforeseen danger of Pyongyang\u2019s weapons tests. Flight trackers put the plane close to Japan around the time of Pyongyang\u2019s Hwasong-15 missile test on 29 November. The missile fell into the Sea of Japan. Pyongyang claimed its latest intercontinental ballistic missile was capable of striking anywhere in the US. North Korea has not yet proved it can mount a miniaturised nuclear warhead on its missiles, but the latest test is likely to strengthen its negotiating power with Washington. \u201cThe flight crew of CX893 reported a sighting of what is suspected to be the re-entry of the recent DPRK test missile,\u201d an airline spokesman said, referring to North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. \u201cThough the flight was far from the event location, the crew advised Japan [air traffic control] according to procedures.\u201d The flight was not affected and the company had no plans to change existing routes, the airline said. Mark Hoey, Cathay Pacific\u2019s general manager of operations, recounted the message from the crew of the passenger plane to ground staff. \u201cBe advised, we witnessed the DPRK missile blow up and fall apart near our current location,\u201d the pilots said, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. A Cathay Pacific cargo plane \u2013 CX096 \u2013 may have been even closer to the missile, at a lateral distance of a few hundred metres, Hoey added, according to the report. That flight was bound for Alaska and was also over Japan at the time of the missile test.",
