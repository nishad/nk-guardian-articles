    "content": "The threat posed by North Korea to the US and its allies has entered a \u201cnew phase\u201d, Donald Trump said on Tuesday, a day after the regime test-launched four ballistic missiles towards Japan. In phone talks on Tuesday, Trump told Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that the US stood \u201c100%\u201d with Tokyo after three of the intermediate-range missiles landed in the sea off Japan\u2019s north-west coast. \u201cPresident Trump told me that the United States was with Japan 100%, and that he wanted his comments to be communicated to the Japanese people,\u201d Abe told reporters at his residence. \u201cHe said he wanted us to trust him as well as the United States 100%. \u201cJapan and the United States confirmed that the latest missile firing by North Korea \u2026 is a clear challenge to the region and the international community, and that its threat has entered a new phase.\u201d The comments came as the US said the \u201cfirst elements\u201d of its controversial missile defence system had arrived in South Korea on Tuesday. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) anti-missile system is meant to intercept and destroy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles during the last part of their flights, the US Pacific Command said in a statement. \u201cContinued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday\u2019s launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy Thaad to South Korea,\u201d US Pacific Commander Admiral Harry Harris said. China has denounced Thaad\u2019s deployment, saying its powerful radar would compromise its security. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency, citing military sources, said the system could be operational as early as April, well ahead of schedule. Trump and Abe spoke as the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, declared the launches a success and warned that they were part of a training exercise for an attack on US military bases in Japan, home to almost 50,000 American troops. \u201cThe four ballistic rockets launched simultaneously are so accurate that they look like acrobatic flying corps in formation,\u201d the state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim as saying. The regime also released images of the missile launches, with a smiling Kim in attendance. The launches were seen as a protest against the start of joint military exercises involving South Korea and the US that Pyongyang regards as a rehearsal for an invasion of North Korea. A day after operation Foal Eagle began last Wednesday, North Korea\u2019s army, deploying the same vitriolic language it reserves for the annual drills, warned that it was ready to \u201cimmediately launch its merciless military counteractions\u201d if South Korean or US forces fired \u201ceven a single shell\u201d into waters near the divided Korean peninsula. North Korea\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Ja Song-nam, said the joint exercises were driving the region towards nuclear disaster. \u201cIt may go over to an actual war,\u201d Ja said, adding: \u201cConsequently, the situation on the Korean Peninsula is again inching to the brink of a nuclear war.\u201d Abe said that Trump, who was diplomatically wrong-footed by a North Korean missile launch last month, had reaffirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunwavering\u201d commitment to Japan\u2019s security. The leaders agreed that Monday\u2019s launches were in violation of UN resolutions banning Pyongyang from developing ballistic missile technology. Washington and Tokyo have requested a meeting of the UN security council on Wednesday. Abe said he had told Trump that Japan was willing to take on a \u201clarge role and responsibility to enhance the deterrence provided by the Japan-US alliance\u201d. Trump has yet to state how he intends to address the growing North Korean threat from ballistic missiles, amid evidence that the regime is edging closer to acquiring the ability to marry a miniaturised nuclear warhead with a long-range missile capable of striking the US mainland. The UN has imposed six rounds of sanctions since the North conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, but they have failed to dent the regime\u2019s quest to build what it claims is a \u201cdefensive\u201d nuclear arsenal. Trump has not publicly commented on Monday\u2019s missile launch, but his ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said on Twitter that the world \u201cwon\u2019t allow\u201d North Korea to continue on its \u201cdestructive path\u201d. Choi Kang, an analyst at the Seoul-based Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said the launch was a warning to Tokyo. \u201cNorth Korea is demonstrating that its target is not just limited to the Korean peninsula any more but can extend to Japan at any time and even the US,\u201d he said.",
