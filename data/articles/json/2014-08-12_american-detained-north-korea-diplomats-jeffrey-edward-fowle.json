    "content": "The family of an Ohio man detained in North Korea pleaded for diplomats to bring him home, in a public statement released on Tuesday. Jeffrey Edward Fowle, 56, of Miamisburg was detained by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea on 7 May on charges that he violated his tourist visa. An attorney who read a statement on the family\u2019s behalf, Tim Tete of Lebanon, Ohio, apologized to the isolated state. \u201cJeffrey has been away from his family for over three months now,\u201d said Tete. \u201cThe family would like to express its heartfelt apology to the people and the government of the [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea]. Jeff has apologized publicly for his actions and Jeffrey\u2019s family petitions the government of the DPRK for mercy toward Jeffrey and asks for his release.\u201d Tete said the \u201cnext few days are critical\u201d as the DPRK moves closer to trying Fowle for actions \u201cinconsistent\u201d with being a tourist. In previous statements, Tete has said Fowle was visiting North Korea because he \u201cloves the adventure of experiencing different cultures and seeing new places\u201d. Fowle left a Bible in his hotel room before attempting to leave the country, previous reports from state media said. Tete said Fowle is the primary provider for his wife and three children, and that wife, Tatyana, is \u201cstruggling to manage by herself\u201d. The couple have three children, ages 13, 11 and nine. The Ohio man is one of three currently detained by North Korean authorities. Kenneth Bae, 46, a Korean American missionary, has been detained since November 2012, the longest-held American since the Korean war. Miller Matthew Todd, 24, has been held since April. Calls to extract Bae from North Korea were renewed in August by the Seattle Times \u2013 Bae was a resident of Lynnwood, Washington, about 20 miles north of the city.",
