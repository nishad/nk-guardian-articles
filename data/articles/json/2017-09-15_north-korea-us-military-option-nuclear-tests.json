    "content": "The US has warned it could revert to military options if new sanctions fail to curb North Korean missile and nuclear tests, after Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan for the second time in two weeks. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, and the national security advisor, HR McMaster, told reporters that the latest set of UN sanctions \u2013 imposed earlier this week after North Korea\u2019s sixth nuclear test \u2013 would need time to take effect, but they suggested that after that, the US would consider military action. \u201cWhat is different about this approach is: we\u2019re out of time, right?\u201d McMaster said on Friday. \u201cWe have been kicking the can down the road and we\u2019re out of road. For those who have been commenting about the lack of a military option \u2013 there is a military option. Now, it\u2019s not what we prefer to do, so what we have to do is call on all nations to do everything we can to address this global problem, short of war.\u201d Haley said the North Korea issue could soon become a matter for the Pentagon and the defence secretary, James Mattis. \u201cWe try to push through as many diplomatic options that we can,\u201d the ambassador said, but she noted that Monday\u2019s UN security council sanctions, which capped petrol and oil exports to the regime and banned textile imports, had not deterred Pyongyang from launching a second intermediate range ballistic missile in two weeks over Japanese territory and into the Pacific. In a unanimous statement late on Friday, the UN Security Council said it \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d the missile launch, but did not threaten further sanctions on Pyongyang. The missile flew further than any missile tested by the regime, triggering emergency sirens and text alerts minutes before it passed over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on Friday morning. Flight data shows the missile travelled higher and further than the one involved in the 29 August flyover of Japan, suggesting the regime is continuing to make advances in its missile and nuclear weapons programmes. A new UN security council session was called on Friday to address North Korean defiance, but Haley said there was little more that UN measures could do to change Pyongyang\u2019s behaviour. \u201cIt will take a little bit of time but it has already started to take effect,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we see is that they continue to be provocative, they continue to be reckless and at that point, there is not a whole lot the security council is going to be able to do from here, when you\u2019ve cut 90% of their trade and 30% of the oil. So having said that, I have no problem kicking this to Gen Mattis, because I think he has plenty of options.\u201d However, when he was asked about a possible US military response, Mattis said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that yet.\u201d He said the North Korean launch was a \u201creckless act\u201d which had \u201cput millions of Japanese in duck and cover\u201d. Many strategic analysts argue there is no feasible military option for curtailing North Korean nuclear and missile development, as any pre-emptive attack would be likely to trigger a devastating barrage on Seoul, without any guarantee that all Pyongyang\u2019s missiles and nuclear weapons would be put out of action. The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, put the onus on Beijing and Moscow to implement the agreed sanctions to the limit. \u201cChina supplies North Korea with most of its oil. Russia is the largest employer of North Korean forced labour,\u201d Tillerson said in a statement. \u201cChina and Russia must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own.\u201d North Korea will be a focus of next week\u2019s international summit at the UN general assembly, but China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin will not be attending. Japan has warned North Korea it risked having no \u201cbright future\u201d and called for an emergency meeting of the UN security council after Pyongyang launched a ballistic missile over Japanese territory for the second time in just over two weeks. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, called the launch \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d. He said the recent UN resolution banning North Korean textile exports and capping the supply of oil to the country \u201cshowed the international community\u2019s unified strong will for a peaceful solution. But despite that, North Korea has again carried out this outrageous conduct.\u201d He told reporters shortly after arriving back in Tokyo from a trip to India: \u201cNow is the time when the international community is required to unite against North Korea\u2019s provocative acts, which threaten world peace. We must make North Korea understand that if it continues down this road, it will not have a bright future.\u201d The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing objected to North Korea\u2019s latest launch but believed diplomacy was the only way to solve the \u201ccomplicated, sensitive and grim\u201d problem. \u201cThe top priority is now to prevent any provocative acts,\u201d Hua told reporters. But Hua rejected the theory \u2013 advanced, among others, by Trump and Theresa May, the British prime minister \u2013 that Beijing held the key to thwarting Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear and missile ambitious. \u201cChina is not the focus. China is not the driving force behind the escalating situation. And China is not the key to resolving the issue,\u201d Hua said. Hua said China had already made \u201cgreat sacrifices\u201d and \u201cpaid a high price\u201d in its bid to help rein in Pyongyang: \u201cChina\u2019s willingness and its efforts to fulfill its relevant international responsibilities cannot be questioned.\u201d In an online editorial, the Communist party-controlled Global Times newspaper said it was the US and South Korea, not China, that needed \u201cto guide North Korea into a new strategic direction\u201d through dialogue. \u201cAn isolated North Korea will be more rational if the international society treats it in a rational way,\u201d argued the newspaper, which sometimes reflects official views. It said attempts to intimidate North Korea with threats or shows of force would fail.",
