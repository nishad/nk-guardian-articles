    "content": "Australia\u2019s Nobel peace laureate says America\u2019s aggressive new nuclear policy is \u201ca blueprint for nuclear war\u201d that returns the world to a cold war mentality. Tilman Ruff, the founding chair of the Melbourne-founded International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) said the newly released US nuclear posture review was \u201ca chilling document\u201d. \u201cThis increases the danger of nuclear war \u2026 it clearly flags that great power confrontation with Russia is back on again. It essentially says, \u2018we\u2019re back in the cold war\u2019.\u201d Last Friday the release of Donald Trump\u2019s nuclear posture review revealed a significantly more aggressive stance towards Russia, saying Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime must be convinced it would face \u201cunacceptably dire costs\u201d if it were to threaten even a limited nuclear attack in Europe. The review also cast North Korea as a \u201cclear and grave threat\u201d to the US and marked out China, saying the US arsenal was tailored to \u201cprevent Beijing from mistakenly concluding\u201d it could be advantaged by using its nuclear weapons in Asia. In October, Ican was awarded the 2017 Nobel peace prize for the organisation\u2019s efforts to abolish nuclear weapons globally, in particular through a prohibition treaty adopted by the United Nations. Ican is the first Australian-founded organisation to ever be awarded the peace prize. On the floor of the UN general assembly in July, two-thirds of the world\u2019s countries \u2013 122 nations \u2013 voted in favour of the treaty outlawing nuclear weapons. Fifty-six countries have signed the treaty and five have ratified it. The treaty will come into force when 50 countries have ratified it. None of the declared nuclear states, including the US, have signed on to the treaty. And key allies such as Australia, reliant on the umbrella of US nuclear deterrence, have also refused to endorse the ban on nuclear weapons. The Pentagon-led review of the US nuclear arsenal and the policies that govern it was ordered by Trump a year ago. Such reviews are customarily done at the outset of a new US administration. In a written statement, Trump said US strategy was \u201caimed at making use of nuclear weapons less likely\u201d. But Ruff said the opposite was true, condemning the new US posture as one \u201cthat invests in new, more usable nuclear weapons on submarines and on ships, and that increases the range of options where nuclear retaliation would be considered\u201d. He said the US had abandoned its legal commitment to disarmament, agreed to under article VI of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. \u201cThe goal of a world free of nuclear weapons has disappeared from that document. It\u2019s been described as a blueprint for nuclear war, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too extreme a characterisation.\u201d Ruff said on myriad indicators the risk of global nuclear war was increasing. \u201cThe continued reliance on nuclear weapons; the continued massive investments on keeping them indefinitely; making them more usable and more deadly; the lack of talks about disarmament, the increasingly belligerent postures and extraordinarily specific threats to use nuclear weapons by multiple leaders in multiple parts of the world,\u201d he said. The US position has also been criticised \u2013 predictably \u2013 by China, Iran and Russia. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said the Trump administration\u2019s policy statement was both \u201cconfrontational\u201d and \u201cunscrupulous\u201d while Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said it risked \u201cbringing humankind closer to annihilation\u201d. The Union of Concerned Scientists described it as \u201creckless path\u201d that will weaken US security. On Monday, Ruff was speaking aboard the Peace Boat, which was docked in Sydney Harbour. The Peace Boat, a Japan-based non-government organisation, has toured the world since 1983, promoting peace, human rights and environmental protection. Also on board the ship in Sydney was 85-year-old Tanaka Terumi, who as a 13-year-old, survived an atomic bomb being dropped on Nagasaki. The former university professor has dedicated his life to speaking out on behalf of the Hibakusha, those who survived the Japanese atomic bombings, and to campaigning for the abolition of nuclear weapons. \u201cIt was a truly cruel and inhumane weapon that should never be used again. No one else on this planet should have to experience the pain that my fellow survivors experienced.\u201d",
