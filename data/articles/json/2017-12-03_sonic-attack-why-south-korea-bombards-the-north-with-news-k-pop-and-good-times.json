    "content": "While the world digests North Korea\u2019s declaration that it has joined the club of nuclear states, the usually tranquil border separating the country from its neighbour to the south has again become the setting for a very different form of warfare. Encouraged by last month\u2019s defection of a North Korean soldier, South Korea attempted to compound Pyongyang\u2019s embarrassment by relaying news of the defection to troops and civilians on the other side of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) \u2013 the 4km-wide buffer that has divided the two Koreas since the end of their 1950-53 war. In loudspeaker broadcasts that can be heard over a distance of 24 km at night and 10 km during the day, North Koreans have been spared no detail, from the soldier\u2019s daring flight to freedom and his recovery from wounds inflicted by his erstwhile comrades\u2019 guns, to the parasitic worms surgeons removed from his stomach. South Korea\u2019s broadcasts, aired at ear-splitting volume from 11 sites along the border, draw on a mixture of news, propaganda and music to foment popular disillusionment with the Kim dynasty. Overtly political content occasionally makes way for weather reports, domestic and international news, radio dramas, K-pop and upbeat studio discussions of life in wealthy, free South Korea. Seoul briefly resumed the broadcasts in August 2015 \u2013 ending an 11-year silence \u2013 after two of its soldiers were seriously wounded at the border by landmines allegedly planted by the North. They started up again in January 2016 in response to North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test, prompting the then foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, to warn the South not to \u201crise to the bait\u201d. North Korea has denounced the broadcasts and threatened to destroy the giant speakers, whose exact locations remain a secret. But how effective is Seoul\u2019s aural onslaught? The fury the broadcasts provoke in Pyongyang suggests they dent morale among troops ranged against the border. Most North Koreans live too far from the DMZ to hear them, but defectors have spoken of inwardly questioning the regime after listening to South Korea\u2019s \u201cVoice of Freedom\u201d on shortwave radio and watching bootleg videos of the country\u2019s TV dramas. North Korea is not above responding with cross-border transmissions denouncing Seoul and its US ally. Given the potentially catastrophic consequences of the nuclear standoff between Pyongyang and Washington, perhaps we should be thankful that the confrontation between the two Koreas is confined to the airwaves \u2013 however distressing long-term exposure to Apink may be.",
