Two woman have been charged with murder and seven North Koreans are wanted in connection with the attack on the exiled half-brother of the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un. Arrested Siti Aisyah Nationality Indonesian Age 25 Date of arrest 16 February Siti is accused of wiping an unidentified toxic liquid on Kim Jong-nam\u2019s face. She has told police that she was duped into playing a role in the killing, believing it to be part of a television comedy prank. However, Malaysia\u2019s police chief said Siti was \u201ctrained\u201d and had even practised the attack in various public places, including a shopping mall.

She was wearing a white jumper emblazoned with \u201cLOL\u201d in large black print across the front on the day of the attack. Huong stayed at a hotel near the airport in the days before the attack, booking the cheapest room and carrying a wad of cash. Huong and Siti are the two suspects accused of the assault and were charged with murder on March 1. Released Muhammad Farid bin Jalaluddin Nationality Malaysian Age 26 Date of arrest 15 February Siti\u2019s boyfriend was arrested but police later released him on bail. Ri Jong-chol Nationality North Korean Age 46 Date of arrest 17 February The man is the only North Korean to have been arrested although he was released do to a lack of evidence and deported on March 3.

Kim Uk-il was first named as a \u201cperson of interest\u201d who was called in for questioning. Police later issued an arrest warrant after he failed to appear. Four other North Koreans \u2013 all of whom entered Malaysia less than a month before the attack and left on the day Kim Jong-nam died \u2013 are suspects in the case. The quartet travelled on regular, not diplomatic, passports. Ri Ji-hyon Age 33 Hong Song-hac Age 34 O Jong-gil Age 55 Ri Jae-nam Age 57 A sixth North Korean suspect, Ri Ji U, aged 30, may still be in Malaysia, police say. People of interest Malaysian police are seeking a senior North Korean diplomat from the embassy in Kuala Lumpur, who has been \u201ccalled in for assistance\u201d by investigators, although he is not a suspect. The embassy has aggressively tried to stymie the investigation, demanding that no autopsy take place and the body be released immediately. North Korea\u2019s ambassador, Kang Chol, has since been expelled after Malaysia demanded but did not receive an apology for Pyongyang\u2019s attacks on the investigation.

Police sent a letter to the embassy to request an interview with the diplomat. He has not come forward.",
