    "content": "Donald Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are tentatively scheduled to meet at 9am Singapore time on 12 June, according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said that planning for the historic summit continues. \u201cWe are actively preparing for the 12 June summit between the president and the North Korean leader,\u201d Sanders said on Monday. \u201cWe feel like things are continuing to move forward, and good progress has been made.\u201d Sanders said that the White House \u201cadvance team\u201d \u2013 which features military, security, technical and medical staff - were already on the ground in Singapore. They are \u201cfinalizing preparations and will remain in place until the summit begins,\u201d said Sanders. The announcement of the timing for the first meeting between the two leaders came just three days after Trump hosted a senior North Korean delegation at the White House bearing a letter from Kim. Trump, who had previously canceled the summit, abruptly announced the meeting was back on. Asked about the contents of Kim\u2019s letter, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders declined to \u201cget into the specifics of the letter\u201d but added \u201cwe feel like things are continuing to move forward and good progress has been made.\u201c She added that Trump is getting daily briefings on North Korea in the runup to the landmark meeting. \u201cI can tell you the president has been receiving daily briefings on North Korea from his national security team,\u201d said Sanders. Experts have voiced concern that despite Trump\u2019s claim to be the world\u2019s greatest dealmaker, he knows little about North Korea, arms control or international diplomacy. The on-again-off-again summit is expected to focus on US efforts to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. The oppressive regime is believed to have developed a miniaturized nuclear device that could be placed on a missile that could strike the United States. Washington has called that unacceptable and demanded North Korea embark on full and verifiable denuclearization. With days to go before the meeting, it remains unclear whether Pyongyang is willing to take that step, or whether it is using the promise of talks as a way of easing Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign. Trump last week said he no longer wanted to use that term and indicated that he was willing to embark on a lengthy series of talks that would ease pressure on the regime. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a process,\u201d he said after welcoming top official Kim Yong-chol to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2013 I never said it goes in one meeting. I think it\u2019s going to be a process. But the relationships are building, and that\u2019s a very positive thing.\u201d Trump also said that there would be no new sanctions while the talks are taking place, although the White House was at pains to say existing economic sanctions will not be removed either.",
