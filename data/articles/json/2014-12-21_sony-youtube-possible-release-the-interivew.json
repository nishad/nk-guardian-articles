    "content": "Sony Pictures still wants and intends to release its controversial film The Interview, possibly via YouTube. As President Barack Obama again expressed disappointment in the company\u2019s decision to withdraw the movie in the face of threats thought to originate from North Korea, Michael Lynton, the studio\u2019s chief executive, insisted on Sunday it had \u201cnot caved\u201d to hackers who crippled the company and that it was exploring ways to let audiences see the film. \u201cWe would still like the public to see this movie, absolutely,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThere are a number of options open to us. And we have considered those, and are considering them.\u201d Asked about releasing the film via YouTube, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s certainly an option and certainly one thing we will consider.\u201d Lynton\u2019s comments revived the prospect of audiences legally viewing the comedy which stars James Franco and Seth Rogan as journalists who assassinate North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. The US government has blamed North Korea for the cyber-attack which paralysed the Hollywood studio\u2019s computer networks and splashed its digital archives across the internet. Pyongyang denied any involvement. Anonymous terrorist threats last week, to target screenings, prompted cinema chains and other distributors to refuse to show The Interview. The studio then cancelled the film\u2019s planned 25 December theatrical release and said it had \u201cno plans\u201d for a release in any form. President Barack Obama and many others accused the studio of surrendering to intimidation and setting a precedent for censorship. Lynton struck back on Sunday, saying Sony still wanted to release the film. \u201cWe have always had every desire to have the American public see this movie,\u201d he said. He said cinema chains\u2019 refusal to carry the film forced the theatrical cancellation. \u201cAt that point in time we had no alternative but to not proceed with the theatrical release on 25 December. And that\u2019s all we did. We did not cave, we have not given in, and we have not backed down.\u201d Sony\u2019s original statement last week appeared to rule out any attempt to release The Interview. But Lynton, in an attempt to regain the moral high ground, said it was in fact considering digital and video on-demand options, despite lack of support from distributors. \u201cThere has not been one major video on-demand distributor, one major e-commerce site that has stepped forward and said it is willing to distribute this movie for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that direct interface with the American public and need an intermediary to do to that.\u201d Netflix, Amazon, TimeWarner and other big distributors made no immediate comment. Nor did Google, which owns YouTube. The director Judd Apatow last week predicted the film would be available on BitTorrent within six weeks. The company claims to have more than 170 million monthly active users.",
