How much of what they see (free churches, happy people, bountiful state provision) is just for show? All of it, we suspect. Everywhere, the camera is met with a rictus grin of regime approval, in stark contrast to the testimonies of international journalists and human rights activists. Raising as many questions as it answers, \u00c1lvaro\u2019s film highlights how little we know of real life in North Korea, and how much propaganda from both sides continues to cloud international understanding.",
