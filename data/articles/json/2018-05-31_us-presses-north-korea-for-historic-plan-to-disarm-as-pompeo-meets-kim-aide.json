    "content": "The North Koreans will have to lay out a disarmament plan in the next few days if a planned summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un is to go ahead on schedule in two weeks\u2019 time, a senior US state department official said on Wednesday. The official was speaking in New York as the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and a top North Korean official, Kim Yong-chol, met over a dinner ahead of a day of talks on Thursday aimed at defining negotiating positions and narrowing differences before the summit. In a letter to Kim last week, Trump declared he was calling off the summit scheduled for 12 June in Singapore, after a spat broke out between Washington and Pyongyang over military exercises the US conducted with South Korea, and expectations of the outcome of the unprecedented meeting between the two national leaders. But since then, the two governments have engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at salvaging the summit: in Singapore, the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas, and at Pompeo\u2019s New York meeting with Kim Yong-chol, a former spy chief and vice-chairman of the ruling Workers\u2019 party. Preparations for the summit broke down last week over the insistence from leading US officials that North Korea would have to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme fully and rapidly before receiving any benefits, a position Pyongyang rejected as one-sided. Asked what the regime would have to do for the summit to go ahead, a senior state department official said: \u201cBetween now and if we\u2019re going to have a summit, they\u2019re going to have to make clear what they\u2019re willing to do.\u201d The US was looking for CVID, \u201ccomplete verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation\u201d, the official said, but did not specify the timing of such a process or whether it would have to be carried out all at once, or in phases. \u201cI think we are looking for something historic,\u201d the official said. \u201cI think we\u2019re looking for something that has never been done before.\u201d In return the US was offering \u201cthe security guarantees they feel they need\u201d and help for North Korea to achieve greater prosperity. If the North Koreans were not prepared to take unprecedented steps to disarm, the official added: \u201cWe will ramp up the pressure on them and we\u2019ll be ready for the day that hopefully they are.\u201d The official said that the New York talks were being conducted by the \u201ctwo top dogs\u201d in the preparatory negotiations. Pompeo tweeted that he had had a \u201cgood working dinner\u201d with Kim on Wednesday night of steak, corn and cheese. \u201cI will remind you that the secretary of state is from the heartland and likes American food, and he\u2019s hosting someone who\u2019s never been to our country,\u201d the senior state department official said. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile met his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, on Thursday in Pyongyang, a trip seen as an attempt by Moscow to make its voice heard in its neighbour state\u2019s push for diplomacy. Lavrov invited Kim Jong Un to Russia and passed on best wishes from president Vladimir Putin, the Russian foreign ministry said.",
