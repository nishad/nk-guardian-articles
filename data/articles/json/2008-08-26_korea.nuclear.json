    "content": "North Korea suspended the disablement of its nuclear facilities yesterday, accusing the United States of reneging on a disarmament agreement. The foreign ministry in Pyongyang said it would consider rebuilding its reactor and cooling tower in Yongbyon because the US has not lived up to a promise to remove North Korea from a list of nations it acccuses of sponsoring terrorism. In a statement carried by the Korea Central News Agency, the ministry said the US was insisting on extra inspections that would infringe upon its sovereignty. \"The US is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] as it pleases just as it did in Iraq,\" said the statement. \"We have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities.\" The statement is a blow to hopes for an easing of tension on the Korean peninsula after a landmark agreement last year in which North Korea committed to dismantling its facilities in return for energy supplies and a lifting of sanctions and its pariah status.",
