    "content": "Here are the oddities that stood out from Tuesday\u2019s historic meeting between the US and North Korean leaders: 1. Welcome to the matrix Even Kim recognised how bizarre a meeting it was; a meeting of equals between the leader of an impoverished rogue nation and the president of the most powerful country in the world. \u201cMany people in the world will think of this as a ... form of fantasy ... from a science-fiction movie,\u201d Kim said, through an interpreter. Just months ago the two were trading threats of nuclear war and calling each other \u201cfat\u201d and a \u201cdotard\u201d. 2. Raw emotion The former basketball star Dennis Rodman, the American who has spent the most time with Kim, was interviewed by CNN about the summit and broke down in tears. In a rambling interview, he claimed credit for the summit taking place and described how he had received death threats when he first met Kim. \u201cBut I took all those bullets, I took all at that \u2026 but I\u2019m still standing. Today is a great day for everybody: Singapore, Tokyo, China, everybody \u2026 it\u2019s a great day. I\u2019m here to see it. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d 3. Inside \u2018the Beast\u2019 During a brief walk, Trump guided Kim over to his custom Cadillac limousine and gave him a peek inside. The car, nicknamed \u201cthe Beast\u201d, is armour-plated and has its own oxygen supply in case of a chemical attack. Given Kim\u2019s reported fear of being assassinated, he may want to buy one for himself if relations warm. 4. Custom pen Trump and Kim signed three documents with a black pen emblazoned in gold with the US president\u2019s signature. Photographs of the document emerged online, showing that Kim committed to \u201ccomplete denuclearisation\u201d and Trump to providing \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d. It was the icing on the cake of a day that was largely about photo ops and symbolism, and light on substance in dealing with North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. 5. \u2018Nice and handsome and thin\u2019 Trump joked with press photographers before he sat down to lunch with Kim, asking them to ensure their pictures made the two leaders look \u201cnice and handsome and thin\u201d. Kim\u2019s blank reaction has been mocked online, although he may not have understood the president\u2019s remark because it was not translated in full by Trump\u2019s Korean interpreter. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2018 because an earlier version referred to a translator, when an interpreter was meant.",
