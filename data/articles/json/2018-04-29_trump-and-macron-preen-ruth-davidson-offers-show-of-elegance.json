    "content": "How adorable to see all the man-cuddles between world leaders. There were presidents Trump and Macron, the former brushing imaginary dandruff off the latter\u2019s shoulder, in such a painfully desperate attempt to appear dominant that one can only imagine that Stormy Daniels felt horribly triggered. Elsewhere, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un and South Korea\u2019s Moon Jae-in decided to ditch all the nuclear unpleasantness for the Korean answer to male bonding, which presumably ended with a night in, with just Netflix, popcorn, 750 bodyguards and, in Moon\u2019s case, a cyanide pellet in a back molar to crunch down on, should there be a disagreement over which Will Ferrell film was funniest. Some people might view such macho bonding displays as body language Armageddon, but phooey to such cynicism. Arguably, somewhere within all those waist-stroking, ear-nuzzling moments, world peace was definitely achieved?* (*maybe). So what if Trump\u2019s handshakes were so furiously hard-yanking that Macron could have been forgiven for keeping a chiropractor on speed-dial. Likewise, does it matter if Kim and Moon strolling hand in hand made it seem as though the world\u2019s nuclear fate rested on North Korea\u2019s Tweedledum remaining pals with South Korea\u2019s Tweedledee? Or that, like me, some people\u2019s immediate thought was: \u201cThe Teletubbies look even weirder with their costumes off.\u201d One message from this politically \u201chandsy\u201d week came through loud and clear \u2013 when male politicians bond, as when Tony Blair sported his jeans during his own unforgettable 2001 big-boy sleepover with George W Bush at Camp David, subtlety is never the goal. Nearer home, comparisons could be drawn with the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, who somehow announced her pregnancy without once lewdly grabbing her crotch or even that of her partner, Jen Wilson \u2013 both women exhibiting nothing but natural, easy happiness. Perhaps when everything that\u2019s happening is real, there\u2019s no need for hyperbolic alpha-gesturing? \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",
