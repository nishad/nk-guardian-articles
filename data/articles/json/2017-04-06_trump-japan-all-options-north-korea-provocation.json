    "content": "Donald Trump has vowed to boost the US\u2019s military capabilities to counter the threat from North Korean missiles, hours before he is due to meet the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, for talks that are expected to be dominated by Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. In a telephone call on Thursday morning, Trump told the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that \u201call options are on the table\u201d \u2013 including military action \u2013 to address provocations by North Korea. Trump \u201cmade clear that the United States will continue to strengthen its ability to deter and defend itself and its allies with the full range of its military capabilities\u201d, the White House said in a statement about the 35-minute call. \u201cThe president emphasised that the United States stands with its allies Japan and South Korea in the face of the serious threat that North Korea continues to pose.\u201d In a further sign of rising tensions on the Korean peninsula, South Korea on Thursday test-launched a ballistic missile that is capable of striking any part of North Korea. Yonhap news agency cited a senior South Korean official as saying the missile, with a range of 800km (500 miles), would act as a \u201cstrong deterrent\u201d against provocations from the North. Seoul plans to deploy the new missile this year after further tests, Yonhap said. South Korea has been developing missiles with longer ranges to counter its neighbour\u2019s missile programme under a 2012 agreement with the US. The South\u2019s test comes a day after North Korea fired a ballistic missile from its eastern port of Sinpo, a move experts believe was intended to remind Trump and Xi of Pyongyang\u2019s determination to develop a long-range missile capable of carrying a miniaturised nuclear warhead. North Korea is expected to feature prominently during talks at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Thursday and Friday, days after the president warned that the US was prepared to act alone against North Korea if China refused to exert more pressure on Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. \u201cIf China is not going to solve North Korea, we will,\u201d Trump said in a newspaper interview at the weekend. His administration is reportedly considering sanctions against Chinese banks and firms that provide North Korea access to the international financial system, while retaining the option of conducting a pre-emptive military strike. Trump and Abe agreed that North Korea\u2019s latest ballistic missile test posed a threat to security in the region, the Japanese prime minister told reporters after the phone call. \u201c[We] agreed that yesterday\u2019s missile launch by North Korea was a dangerous provocative act and a grave threat to security. I told him that Japan is watching closely how China will cope with this North Korean issue. \u201cPresident Trump then made a strong remark, saying all options are on the table.\u201d Susan Thornton, the top US diplomat for East Asia, called North Korea \u201can urgent and global threat\u201d. She told reporters: \u201cWe are looking for an action-focused, results-oriented approach, and we are going to be trying to cooperate with other partners and allies in a global coalition really to try to solve this problem in an urgent way that we haven\u2019t really taken up before.\u201d Thornton said Washington\u2019s commitment to the defence of South Korea and Japan was \u201cironclad\u201d, adding: \u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to ensure that we\u2019re going to maintain security in that region and that we\u2019re going to be very serious about pursuing a solution to the illegal North Korean weapons programmes.\u201d But Kurt Campbell, who served as the US\u2019s senior diplomat dealing with Asia during Barack Obama\u2019s first term as president, warned that Trump\u2019s rhetoric lacked credibility. \u201cHe\u2019s making it seem like we are prepared to go to war or use military action \u2026 and I don\u2019t think that is going to be viable,\u201d Campbell told Associated Press. \u201cThe key about using leverage in negotiation is that you have to be credible.\u201d On Trump\u2019s ultimatum to China over its reluctance to place more pressure on North Korea, he said: \u201cI think the Chinese are likely to see through this.\u201d Japan\u2019s government is facing calls to strengthen its own defences against North Korean missiles, including the option of striking the regime\u2019s missile bases immediately after an attack. A proposal by the ruling Liberal Democratic party\u2019s security panel urges Abe to consider giving Japan the option of launching counterattacks against North Korean military targets. The panel claims possessing that capability would not violate Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, which confines its military to a strictly defensive role. \u201cTo properly defend Japan we have to be able to attack the bases from where North Korean missiles are launched,\u201d said Itsunori Onodera, a former defence minister who leads the panel. \u201cThis is to prevent a second or third attack. These are not pre-emptive strikes, but counterattacks that fall within the scope of self-defence.\u201d",
