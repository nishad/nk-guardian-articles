    "content": "Donald Trump has delivered a stark personal message to Kim Jong-un, saying North Korea will face disaster unless he gives up his nuclear ambitions. Speaking in front of lawmakers at South Korea\u2019s national assembly, the US president offered a \u201cbrighter path\u201d if Pyongyang abandoned its weapons programme, leaving the door open to diplomacy, but also warned that the US was prepared to use military means if necessary. \u201cThe weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.\u201d Trump has spent two days in South Korea as part of his 12-day tour of east Asia. Addressing Kim directly, he said \u201cdespite every crime you have committed against God and man\u201d, the US was prepared to resolve the crisis diplomatically. \u201cWe will offer a path to a much better future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt begins with an end to the aggression of your regime, a stop to your development of ballistic missiles, and complete, verifiable and total denuclearisation.\u201d But Trump also issued a warning to the regime, saying: \u201cDo not underestimate us. Do not try us.\u201d He said the US would not tolerate threats to its cities and \u201cwould not be intimidated\u201d. \u201cNorth Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned, it is a hell that no person deserves,\u201d he told Pyongyang. Trump gave a blistering assessment of life inside the reclusive dictatorship, highlighting a host of human rights abuses including forced labour, arbitrary detentions and famine. Park Ju-min, a lawmaker who attended the speech, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good that he didn\u2019t make any comments that will enrage North Korea. \u201cOf course, North Korea will feel offended because of Trump\u2019s focus on human rights abuses, but he did not make any specific threats against Kim.\u201d Park added that he was hoping to hear more about improving communication between South Korea and the US, saying he was worried about the US acting unilaterally in dealing with North Korea. Trump said the world would not tolerate \u201cthe menace of a rogue regime\u201d and further nuclear provocations. He also called on China and Russia to help resolve the nuclear crisis by downgrading diplomatic relations with Pyongyang and severing all trade ties. China is North Korea\u2019s most important diplomatic ally and largest trading partner, and Trump has long said Beijing holds the key to controlling Kim\u2019s regime. After speaking in Seoul, Trump flew to Beijing, where he will meet Xi Jinping on Thursday on the next leg of his tour. \u201cIt is our responsibility and our duty to confront this danger together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer we wait, the great[er] the danger grows and the fewer the options become.\u201d But in a briefing onboard Air Force One, senior US officials admitted efforts to open a dialogue with North Korea had been \u201cdiscouraging\u201d. Any discussions where it was not open to giving up its nuclear weapons were \u201ca non-starter\u201d, a White House official said, adding that any agreement must include inspections. Before the speech, Trump was forced to abandon a surprise visit to the demilitarised zone separating South Korea and North Korea. A heavy fog prevented the president\u2019s helicopter from landing on a trip that was meant to show support for US allies in the region and has been a tradition of past presidents. Min Pyung-doo, a lawmaker in the ruling Democratic party, said of Trump\u2019s speech: \u201cHe had some tough words, but the real message is that there is a path to peace through dialogue. \u201cHe reassured us and the world that the alliance with South Korea is strong and that will go a long way to calming the people\u2019s fears here.\u201d The US president has struck a more conciliatory tone during his two days in South Korea, placing greater emphasis on diplomatic efforts. He said there was \u201cprogress\u201d in resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis during a press conference on Tuesday, but declined to give details. The same day, North Korea showed little sign of giving up its nuclear programme. A commentary in the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers\u2019 party said \u201cwe will further bolster our nuclear, treasured sword of justice\u201d if the US continues \u201chostile acts\u201d.",
