The regime can now mount a warhead to a strategic ballistic missile, state media said, making its attacking range much greater. South Korea said the explosion at 9am local time (1.30am BST) was the biggest of the North\u2019s five tests so far with a yield of 10 kilotonnes. The explosion was recorded as a 5.3 magnitude seismic event by monitors in the US, Japan, China and Europe. World leaders and ministries including US president Barack Obama and China\u2019s foreign ministry have condemned the test. For more reading, there\u2019s Justin McCurry\u2019s news wrap here and an analysis of what this means for the standoff between Pyongyang and the west by world affairs editor Julian Borger here. Thanks for reading. There has been further condemnation of the nuclear test from world leaders. France called on the United Nations Security Council to quickly face the issue, AP reports. The French presidency says \u201cthe international community must unite against this new provocation.\u201d France\u2019s Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault says Friday\u2019s test is a \u201cserious act which infringes the world\u2019s peace and security.\u201d He says \u201cthis escalation is unacceptable.\u201d Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende also condemned Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear test, saying in a tweet that \u201cthis unacceptable action causes deep concern &amp; threatens peace.\u201d North Korea\u2019s latest and fifth nuclear test, if confirmed, is \u201cdeeply troubling and regrettable\u201d, the head of the UN atomic watchdog said. \u201cThis is in clear violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions and in complete disregard of the repeated demands of the international community,\u201d said Yukiya Amano, chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency. \u201cIt is a deeply troubling and regrettable act,\u201d Amano said in a statement. \u201cThe Agency continues to closely follow the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear issue. We remain ready to contribute to its peaceful resolution by resuming our verification activities in the country once a political agreement is reached among countries concerned.\u201d South Korea\u2019s intelligence agency is concerned that North Korea is advancing faster to miniaturize warheads on missiles, a lawmaker said after receiving an agency briefing on the North\u2019s latest nuclear test. Kim Byung-kee, a member of the South Korean parliament\u2019s intelligence committee, cited the spy agency as saying the North\u2019s nuclear test was intended to project a strong image of its leader, Kim Jong Un, on the anniversary of the country\u2019s 1948 foundation as a republic, as well as defy international sanctions. Hello Jamie Grierson in London here. First up, we have more from Reuters on the impact the nuclear test has had on Asian stock markets, and is likely to have on European markets. Asian shares extended losses after North Korea conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test on Friday, heightening geopolitical tensions in the region at a time when investors are grappling with slowing global growth. Stocks were already on the back foot when the North Korean news rattled markets, with uncertainty over the prospect of further easing from the European Central Bank pressuring global equities and bonds. European shares look set to follow Asia lower, with financial spreadbetters expecting Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC 40 to all open down 0.1 percent. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.5 percent after touching a 13-month high on Thursday. The decline shrank gains for the week to 2.5 percent. Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed flat after pulling back earlier on reports of the North Korean nuclear test. It up 0.2 percent for the week. South Korea\u2019s KOSPI also extended losses on its neighbour\u2019s nuclear activity. After opening 0.7 percent lower, it was last trading down 1.3 percent from Thursday\u2019s close. China\u2019s CSI 300 index was 0.25 percent lower, and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.2 percent. They are set for gains of 0.7 percent and 1 percent, respectively, for the week. I\u2019m about to hand over the blog to my colleagues in London but here are the main points so far: North Korea has carried out its fifth nuclear test The regime can now mount a warhead to a strategic ballistic missile, state media said, making its attacking range much greater. South Korea said the explosion at 9am local time (1.30am BST) was the biggest of the North\u2019s five tests so far with a yield of 10 kilotonnes. The explosion was recorded as a 5.3 magnitude seismic event by monitors in the US, Japan, China and Europe. US president Barack Obama warns of \u201cserious consequences\u201d. China says it is \u201cresolutely opposed\u201d to the test. South Korean president Park Geun-hye says it shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s \u201cmaniacal recklessness\u201d. Japan also condemned the test and said it could not be tolerated. Asian stock markets have mostly dipped on the news. Today is the 68th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, aka North Korea. For more reading, there\u2019s Justin McCurry\u2019s news wrap here and an analysis of what this means for the standoff between Pyongyang and the west by world affairs editor Julian Borger here. There\u2019s also a timeline on the North\u2019s nucler programme here. Statements from the official KCNA news agency and the TV bulletin claimed a major breakthrough in the country\u2019s missile and nuclear technology. The regime has conducted a lot more missile tests this year, the latest coming earlier this week as world leaders gathered in China for the G20. Combined with today\u2019s nuclear warhead test, the statement claimed a technological advance enabling the explosive to be fitted to the missile. The test had: finally examined and confirmed the structure and specific features of movement of a nuclear warhead that has been standardized to be able to be mounted on strategic ballistic rockets. The standardization of the nuclear warhead will enable [North Korea] to produce at will and as many as it wants a variety of smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike power with a firm hold on the production of various fissile materials and technology for their use. This has definitely put on a higher level [the North\u2019s] technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic rockets. Here is a clip from the state TV bulletin announcing the test. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t speak Korean \u2013 there are subtitles. Adam Cathcart, a North Korea and China expert from Leeds University, says today\u2019s test \u201carrives at a peculiar moment for the government in Beijing and presents both a political and propaganda challenge for how they respond\u201d. Cathcart adds: Because Chinese state media has so heavily criticised South Korea\u2019s plans for anti-missile deployment (THAAD), the temptation will be to say, \u2018We told you so,\u2019 arguing that South Korea effectively was the provocative actor that forced North Korea into a corner. Of course this would be to ignore the orgy of actual missile launches from North Korea. But since \u2013 according to the Chinese Communist party \u2013 Seoul has \u2018opened Pandora\u2019s box\u2019 with the help of the USA, there exists plenty of rhetorical space for blame-shifting. Asked how China might respond, Cathcart added: After the well-worn phrases comes the bargaining at the UN \u2013 but I don\u2019t see much appetite for sanctions that bite deeper in terms of China\u2019s flow of trade along the shared border. US president Barack Obama says North Korea\u2019s actions will have \u201cserious consequences\u201d, Reuters reports. The president, who has returned to the White House after the G20 summit in China and the Asean meeting in Laos, had been briefed by National Security Adviser Susan Rice about the situation as he travelled back on Air Force One, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. Obama repeated the \u201cunbreakable\u201d commitment of the US to the security of its allies in Asia and around the world, Earnest said. China has stopped short of a full condemnation of North Korea\u2019s nuclear upping of the ante in east Asia. The foreign ministry in Beijing said on Friday that it was \u201cresolutely opposed to North Korea\u2019s latest nuclear test and strongly urges North Korea to stop taking any actions that will worsen the situation\u201d. China would stick to its aim of denuclearising the Korean peninsula and \u201cuphold the six-party talks process to resolve the issue\u201d, the ministry said. Associated Press has reported more on the full statement put out on North Korean TV. Here are the key points: The test \u201cexamined and confirmed\u201d specific features of a nuclear warhead designed to be mounted on ballistic missiles There was no radioactive leakage or adverse environmental impact caused by the test. The test elevated the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal and was part of its response to the international sanctions following its earlier nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in January and February. It showed the country was ready to hit back if provoked by enemies including the United States, and that it would continue its efforts to strengthen the quantity and quality of its nuclear weapons. And a few pictures. Justin McCurry in Tokyo has written a full news wrap of the day\u2019s events so far. Read it in full here: North Korea has confirmed that it has carried out its fifth nuclear test. State TV said the North was \u201cnow capable of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic rockets\u201d South Korea said the explosion at 9am local time (1.30am BST) was the biggest of the North\u2019s five tests so far with a yield of 10 kilotonnes. The explosion was recorded as a 5.3 magnitude seismic event by monitors in the US, Japan, China and Europe. South Korean president Park Geun-hye says it shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s \u201cmaniacal recklessness\u201d. Japan also condemned the test and said it could not be tolerated. Asian stock markets have mostly dipped on the news. Today is the 68th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, aka North Korea. As promised, world affairs editor Julian Borger has filed his analysis of the situation. He says that today\u2019s test could force the US back to the negotiating table with North Korea. The game-changer seems to be that the increasing number of tests shows the North could put a small warhead on a ballistic missile and therefore in theory attack another country. Here\u2019s an excerpt from Julian\u2019s piece: Until two years ago the conventional wisdom on the North\u2019s nuclear programme was that it was largely a political symbol of the country\u2019s potency and a bargaining chip for economic and diplomatic benefits. Since 2014 however the pace of nuclear and missile testing has accelerated, to the point where some experts now believe the country\u2019s scientists have developed a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile. \u201cIt is likely now that North Korea could at this point put a nuclear warhead on a short or medium range missile which could reach South Korea, Japan and US military installations in the region,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, the director for non-proliferation policy at the Arms Control Association. However she thought it would be up to another decade before Pyongyang developed a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US. \u201cAll this activity is aimed at expanding the size of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal and expanding its delivery options,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cIt is taking steps to quality-improve its missiles, using solid fuel so they can be deployed more quickly, and extending their range. The trajectory points to a growing North Korean nuclear threat and the next US administration will have to prioritise that threat.\u201d Read the full article here: More on North Korea\u2019s confirmation. State TV said the North was now capable of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic rockets, Reuters reports. It said no leakage of nuclear material had occurred in the test and that there was no environmental impact. North Korea has confirmed that it conducted a \u201cnuclear warhead explosion\u201d on Friday in response to \u201cUS hostility\u201d, according to Associated Press. The latest test, once confirmed, shows that the sanctions-driven policy of the US and its regional allies has reached the limit of its effectiveness, according to an expert quoted by Reuters. Tadashi Kimiya, a University of Tokyo professor specialising in Korean issues said: \u201cSanctions have already been imposed on almost everything possible, so the policy is at an impasse. In reality, the means by which the United States, South Korea and Japan can put pressure on North Korea have reached their limits,\u201d he said. Our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, who has followed the development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme for years, says the test indicates a greater level of ambition in Pyongyang than might have been assumed before. We\u2019ll have his full article shortly but here is a taster: North Korea\u2019s fifth nuclear test confirms growing fears in the international community that the regime\u2019s nuclear aspirations are far more far-reaching than once assumed and that Kim Jong-un is building a sizeable arsenal designed to be used if his rule comes under serious threat. There has been no official confirmation from North Korea about whether it conducted its fifth nuclear test today or not. But a lot of evidence points in that direction at the moment. Here\u2019s what we know: A large earthquake of magnitude 5.3 was recorded near the North\u2019s nuclear tests site at around 9.30am local time on Friday (1.30am BST), according to US, Chinese and Japanese monitors. The US Geological Survey described it as an explosion rather than a tremor. The source of the tremor was at ground level, not below ground like most naturally occurring seismic events. Japan and South Korea have confirmed that it was a nuclear test. South Korea also said the explosion was the biggest of the North\u2019s five tests with a yield of 10 kilotonnes. South Korean president Park Geun-hye said it showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s \u201cmaniacal recklessness\u201d. Park discussed the issue with Barack Obama and the US National Security Council is \u201cmonitoring the situation\u201d. Japan also condemned the test and said it could not be tolerated. Asian stock markets dipped on the news. Today is the 68th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, aka North Korea. South Korean experts believe the blast was the biggest yet carried out by its neighbours. A defence ministry spokesman in Seoul told reporters the blast measured 10 kilotonnes, AFP reports. The North\u2019s third nuclear test, staged in February 2013, was previously considered the most powerful to date, with a yield of six to nine kilotonnes. This backs up what US expert Jeffrey Lewis said earlier today. you can find more detail on his comments here. Kim Nam-Wook from the South\u2019s meteorological agency said: The 10-kilotonne blast was nearly twice the fourth nuclear test and slightly less than the Hiroshima bombing, which was measured about 15 kilotonnes. Further evidence of a nuclear test came from South Korean experts, who said today\u2019s 5.3-magnitude \u201cartificial earthquake\u201d had \u201calmost identical patterns\u201d to previous detonations. The South Korean president has spoken to US president Barack Obama about the North Korea nuclear test, according to the local Yonhap news agency. Obama and Park discussed the situation while Obama was flying back to the United States from the Asean summit in Laos. Stock markets in the Asian time zone suffered in the wake of what Japan and South Korea have now confirmed wasa fifth nuclear test. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.2% in the morning session to 16,927.20. South Korea\u2019s Kospi lost 1.3% to 2,036.07. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was up 0.5% to 24,026.89, while the Shanghai Composite slipped nearly 0.2% to 3,090.58. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 0.8% to 5,342.102. The losses come the day after Asian shares completed a full recovery from heavy losses 12 months ago in the wake of China\u2019s surprise devaluation. South Korea has joined Japan in determining that North Korea has conducted its fifth nuclear test, according to Yonhap. South Korea\u2019s KBS Radio quoted a defence ministry official in Seoul as confirming that Friday morning\u2019s earthquake was caused by a nuclear detonation. The official told reporters that the test\u2019s explosive yield was estimated at ten kilotonnes, which would make it the most powerful of North Korea\u2019s five nuclear tests, KBS added. The regime\u2019s previous nuclear test in January yielded six kilotonnes. South Korean president Park Geun-hye also appears to have confirmed that Seoul believes the North has carried out a nuclear test. Quoting her office, Reuters says Park said that the North\u2019s fifth nuclear test showed the country\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un was guilty of \u201cmaniacal recklessness\u201d in completely ignoring the world\u2019s call to abandon his pursuit of nuclear weapons. Japan\u2019s government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, has told reporters that the government had determined that Friday\u2019s earthquake was caused by a North Korean nuclear test. Suga did not explain how Japanese officials had arrived at that conclusion. The Japanese have also lodged a protest with the North Koreans, the Kyodo news agency said. Still no word from North Korea though. North Korean state TV did not, as some had speculated, confirm the test had taken place during its noon news broadcast, according to Martyn Williams who runs the North Korea Tech blog. Williams said the next broadcast was not due until 5pm local time. Confirmation could come from other sources, however, including the country\u2019s state news agency KCNA. North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme, which has brought sanctions from the UN, began in the 1980s and the first nuclear bomb test was in 2006. A useful timeline setting out the development of the programme and other missile tests can be found here: If this does turn out to be a nuclear test \u2013 and we\u2019re still waiting some kind of confirmation from North Korea or the international community \u2013 much of the focus will be on what type of bomb was tested. This would be the country\u2019s fifth nuclear test. The last one was in January this year and there was considerable debate about what type of bomb was involved. A very good explainer about this was written here by our own Michael Safi. North Korea claimed then it was a hydrogen or thermonuclear bomb and that the test put NK in \u201cthe front rank of nuclear powers\u201d. Western experts were sceptical, however, because tests put the yield from the blast at around 6-10 kilotonnes \u2013 less than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. The yield from a thermonuclear device would be up to one thousand times greater than that as this table illustrates. But this explosion is bigger than the one in January, according to experts. This tweet from Andy Frassetto from the American seismology institute Iris, indicates that is the case. North Korea media has been quiet so far but today is the 68th anniversary of the country\u2019s founding by Kim Il-sung, grandfather of the current leader Kim Jong-un. Our man in Tokyo, Justin McCurry, says that Japan\u2019s Kyodo news agency reports from Beijing that North Korean state TV has not reported on the suspected nuclear test. Instead, it was showing archive footage of Kim the elder, and his son Kim Jong-il to mark the anniversary. Chinese state media have published a photograph of children at a primary school in Yanbian, a city near the North Korean border, who were evacuated from class following the suspected test. The students were taken out of the building to avoid \u201cpotential danger,\u201d reports say. Also, CCTV, China\u2019s state broadcaster, is reporting that the country\u2019s department of environmental protection has launched a level-two emergency response to the suspected test. Nuclear radiation monitoring is being carried out along China\u2019s northeastern border with North Korea. The US National Security Council says it is monitoring the situation in Korea. A spokesman, Ned Price, said: We are aware of seismic activity on the Korean Peninsula in the vicinity of a known North Korean nuclear test site. We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partners. There has been a lot of reaction to the possible nuclear test, which happened at 9.30am local time on Friday (1.30am BST). Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, said the test \u201ccould not be tolerated\u201d and that Japan would protest strongly to Pyongyang if confirmed, Reuters reported. Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told an emergency press conference on Friday morning that the government was acting swiftly to gather information. We think that there is a possibility that this quake occurred because North Korea carried out a nuclear test. Meanwhile, South Korea also believes the test \u2013 if proved \u2013 would be the North\u2019s biggest ever, tallying with the view of US expert Jeffrey Lewis in the last post. The 5.3 seismic event would indicate that North Korea has detonated its biggest nuclear device so far \u2013 if indeed it turns out to be a nuclear test, according to an analyst quoted by Reuters. Jeffrey Lewis of the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies said the magnitude pointed to a 20- to 30-kilotonne yield. Lewis, using the North\u2019s official title of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, said: That\u2019s the largest DPRK test to date, 20-30kt, at least. Not a happy day. Yield estimates are always kind of approximate. The point is that it is the biggest one to date unless they revise the yield downward. For comparison, the initial analysis of North Korea\u2019s January 2016 test estimated a yield of just 6 kilotonnes. North Korea watchers have reported that activity around the country\u2019s nuclear test site at Sungjibaegam had been building in recent months. Two months ago, the US-based 38 North, a North Korea monitoring project, said satellite images showed a high level of activity at the site, called Punggye-ri. Three days ago it was reported that the North Korea leader, Kim Jung-un, had called on the country\u2019s military to continue developing nuclear weapons. The controversial program \u2013 and the testing of ballistic missiles \u2013 has continued despite condemnation by neighbouring countries and the United Nations. The South Korean government says it believes the \u201cearthquake\u201d detected in North Korea this morning was caused by a nuclear test. The Yonhap news agency quoted a government source as saying there was a \u201chigh possibility\u201d that the 5.3 seismic event was triggered by a nuclear explosion. The The government in Seoul was convening an emergency national security council meeting at the presidential Blue House for 3am BST, Reuters reported. North Korea has carried out a suspected nuclear bomb test after a seismic \u201cexplosion\u201d was recorded by the US Geological Survey near the country\u2019s military test site. There was no confirmation of the test but it was carried out at ground level, the US Geological Survey said, and was described as an explosion. Natrurally occurring seismic events usually take place below the Earth\u2019s surface. The China Earthquake Networks Center also said the tremor was a suspected explosion. We\u2019ll bring you all the reaction to what appears to be the country\u2019s fifth nuclear test. We also have a news story wrapping the main developments so far.",
