    "content": "North Korea promised today to close its nuclear reactor and readmit international inspectors in exchange for fuel aid as the first step towards disarming its atomic arsenal. The arms-for-energy deal reached after major concessions by the US is the first tangible progress made by negotiators in more than three years of six-nation talks aimed at denuclearising the troubled peninsular. \"Obviously we have a long way to go, but we're very pleased with this agreement,\" US assistant secretary of state Christopher Hill told reporters. \"It's a very solid step forward.\" But it immediately stirred up the wrath of neoconservative politicians in Washington, who believe the US conceded too much, and the scepticism of Asian diplomats, who say the most difficult decisions about denuclearisation have yet to be made. The initial phase of the deal is an attempt to wind back the nuclear clock on the peninsular to the situation that existed until 2002, when the last agreement broke down. Over the next 60 days, North Korea must freeze and seal its five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, allow inspections by officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency, and make an inventory of all nuclear programmes. In return, it will receive 50,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil or economic aid of equal value. The US will also begin the process of normalising diplomatic relations and removing North Korea from its list of state-sponsors of terrorism. At the end of this period, a meeting will be held of foreign ministers from all countries at the talks, which also include China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. No deadline is set for North Korea to fully denuclearise, but if it takes irreversible concrete steps towards that goal it will be entitled to another 950,000 tonnes of fuel oil or an equivalent $290m in aid. Once it dismantles all its atomic weapons programmes, South Korea has promised to supply 2,000 megawatts of electricity - worth $8.5bn - under an earlier agreement. US concessions The US side has made major concessions, agreeing to bilateral talks that it previously refused and promising to relax financial restrictions on North Korean-related accounts in Macau's Banco Delta Asia within the next month. After announcing the deal at the Diaoyutai state guesthouse in Beijing, the Chinese envoy, Wu Dawei, said it marked important progress. \"This round of six-party talks marks an important and substantial step forward,\" Wu said earlier. \"The six-party talks not only will benefit the peace, stability and development of the peninsula, but also serve to improve the relations of related sides and also benefit the building of a harmonious north-east Asia.\" But there are many potential stumbling blocks, chief among which is North Korea's alleged uranium enrichment scheme. The current standoff was sparked in 2002, when the US accused Pyongyang of having an illegal uranium program - an accusation that North Korea has denied. Today's document makes no mention of uranium, but the subject cannot be avoided when the two sides begin to discuss an inventory of the North's atomic weapons programs over the next two months. \"We don't have an agreement at this point even on the existence of this program but I certainly have made very clear repeatedly that we need to ensure that we know precisely the status of that,\" Mr Hill said. In Washington, such loopholes could prove a problem when the deal comes before Congress for approval. Even before it was adopted, John Bolton, former US ambassador to the UN called on George Bush to reject it. \"I am very disturbed by this deal,\" Mr Bolton told CNN. \"It sends exactly the wrong signal to would-be proliferators around the world: 'If we hold out long enough, wear down the state department negotiators, eventually you get rewarded,' in this case with massive shipments of heavy fuel oil for doing only partially what needs to be done.\" Relations with Japan Potential problems also loom over North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s. Leaders in Tokyo said they support the nuclear deal and, over the next 60 days, have promised to start talks aimed at normalising relations with North Korea. But they refuse to supply energy or other aid until the abduction issue is settled. \"We understand it marks the first concrete step by North Korea toward its nuclear dismantlement,\" the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said after the accord was struck in Beijing. \"But our position that Japan cannot provide support without a resolution of the abduction issue is unchanged.\" Other statesmen said the deal was necessary, but appeared unlikely to break through the distrust on both sides that destroyed the 1994 Agreed Framework. North Korea is still technically at war with the US and South Korea, having never signed at peace treaty in the wake of the 1950-53 Korean war. \"This does not solve the problem in any fundamental way. But at the moment it is the best deal we can get. We must start somewhere,\" said Ham Seung-Joo, former foreign minister of South Korea. \"The most we can hope is that one day we will look back and say this is the deal that kept North Korea from strengthening its nuclear arsenal.\" One positive development in the latest agreement is that it was signed by all six of major regional players, unlike previous deals. But even inside the host nation China, there were questions about the long-term cost of backing down to Pyongyang. \"The six-party talks have taken a step towards accepting North Korea's nuclear blackmail,\" said Professor Zhang Liankui, a foreign affairs expert at the Central party school in Beijing. \"This was supposed to be about regional security not aid. Other nations will take a lesson from North Korea's strategy: develop nuclear weapons and then ask for aid.\"",
