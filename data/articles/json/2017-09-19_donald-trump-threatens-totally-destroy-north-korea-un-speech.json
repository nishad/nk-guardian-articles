    "content": "Donald Trump has threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea, in a bellicose first address to the United Nations general assembly in which he lashed out at a litany of US adversaries and called on \u201crighteous\u201d countries to confront them. The speech was greeted in the UN chamber mostly with silence and occasional outbreaks of disapproving murmurs, as Trump castigated a succession of hostile regimes. In an address heavy with echoes of George W Bush\u2019s \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d State of the Union address more than 15 years earlier, Trump said: \u201cThe scourge of our planet today are a small group of rogue regimes. \u201cIf the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph,\u201d the president said. He first singled out North Korea, recounting its history of kidnapping, oppression, and missile and nuclear tests. \u201cThe US has great strength and patience,\u201d Trump said. But he added: \u201cIf it is forced to defend ourselves or our allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.\u201d As alarmed murmurs spread around the hall, Trump had another barb. Using his newly adopted epithet for Kim Jong-un, Trump said: \u201cRocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.\u201d He said the US was \u201cready, willing and able\u201d to take military action, but said hopefully that would be unnecessary if the rest of the world stepped up its efforts to constrain the Pyongyang regime. \u201cThat is what the United Nations is for,\u201d the president said. \u201cLet\u2019s see how they do.\u201d Trump moved on to Iran, claiming that the Islamic Republic had robbed a great people of its destiny. \u201cThe entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran\u2019s people are what their leaders fear the most,\u201d he said, adding that the day would come when the Iranian people would be faced with a choice between \u201cthe path of poverty, bloodshed and terror\u201d and their country\u2019s \u201cproud roots as a center of civilisation, culture, and wealth\u201d. Trump said the Iran nuclear deal, signed by the US under the Obama administration with five other countries two years ago, was \u201cone of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into\u201d. \u201cFrankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve heard the last of it \u2013 believe me.\u201d Trump must decide by 15 October on whether to certify Iranian compliance or not. His threatened withdrawal of presidential endorsement could lead to Congress reimposing nuclear-related sanctions and the collapse of the agreement. Like much of the 41-minute speech, Trump\u2019s reference to the Iran deal was met by stony silence. The deal is overwhelmingly supported by UN member states, including most of Washington\u2019s closest allies. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also making his UN debut, said he had offered to discuss further constraints on Iranian missile development and curbs on Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme after 2025, when important elements of the 2015 deal expire. But Macron warned that if the existing deal was abandoned it would lead only to a \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d, a nuclear arms race and a situation as serious as the North Korean crisis. The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, responded with a tweet, saying Trump\u2019s \u201cignorant hate speech belongs in medieval times \u2013 not the 21st Century UN\u201d and adding that it was \u201cunworthy of a reply\u201d. \u201cFake empathy for Iranians fools no one,\u201d he said. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was one of the few to applaud when the US president said the world could not abide by the Iran agreement \u201cif it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear programme\u201d. Netanyahu swiftly issued a statement praising Trump. \u201cIn over 30 years in my experience with the UN, I never heard a bolder or more courageous speech,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cPresident Trump spoke the truth about the great dangers facing our world and issued a powerful call to confront them in order to ensure the future of humanity.\u201d Trump is also almost entirely isolated on climate change. Unlike the other opening speakers, including the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Trump made no mention in his speech of an issue that most other leaders in the chamber consider to be the greatest threat to the world. When his turn to speak came, Macron insisted that though the Paris climate accord, which Trump said he would leave, could be improved, \u201cit will not be renegotiated\u201d. He said he \u201cprofoundly respected\u201d the US decision but said \u201cthe door will always be open to them\u201d. The US president had clearly not come to the UN in the mood to placate foreign leaders, but rather to speak over their heads to his own supporters. He picked out one adversary after another, pointing out that he had taken steps to reverse Barack Obama\u2019s policy of detente with Cuba. But he devoted much more of his speech to a rigorous denunciation of the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, which he said was strangling Venezuela through \u201cfaithfully implemented\u201d socialism. Trump vowed to help the Venezuelan people \u201cregain their freedom, recover their country and restore their democracy\u201d. The US has already imposed severe sanctions on the Maduro government and Trump said Washington was ready to take \u201cfurther action\u201d if the regime \u201cpersists on its path to impose authoritarian rule\u201d. The Venezuelan foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, said Trump\u2019s remarks were \u201csad for the world\u201d and said the US president had spoken like a general at the head of an invading army. \u201cWe do not accept threats from President Trump or whoever in the world,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cWe are \u2026 peaceful people and we want relations of mutual respect.\u201d Maduro, who did not attend the UN gathering, reacted angrily from Caracas, calling the US president\u2019s speech an \u201caggression from the new Hitler of international politics, Mr Donald Trump, against the people of Venezuela\u201d. Attacks on other governments took up much of the second half of Trump\u2019s speech. The first half was devoted to outlining his view of international relations, which he repeatedly said should be based on \u201cstrong sovereign nations\u201d with different cultures and values. Trump\u2019s argument against humanitarian intervention and \u201cnation-building\u201d is an approach favoured by Russia, China and much of the Non-Aligned Movement. \u201cAs president of the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cI will put America first, just as you as leaders of your countries will always put your countries first.\u201d It was one of the few lines that drew significant applause. Trump did not explain how that sentiment squared with the second part of his address, in which he called for action against \u201crogue regimes\u201d for their lack of democracy.
