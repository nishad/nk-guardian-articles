    "content": "Five years ago, Chanyang Joo escaped her hometown in North Korea by swimming across the Tumen river. When she arrived in China, she was jailed. \u201cI was in a prison with 20 other escapees,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI was about to be sent back.\u201d Instead, she was rescued by a religious group, reunited with her family in South Korea and became a reality TV star. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a celebrity,\u201d says Joo, 25, who has now appeared on more than 100 TV episodes. \u201cI\u2019m just an ordinary person. It\u2019s hard to deal with fans.\u201d Defector TV is a new craze in South Korea. From comedies to dating, adventure and chatshows, a growing number of programmes are putting North Koreans in the limelight. \u201cI am not pretty or talented enough to be an entertainer, but because of these shows, South Koreans have started to be interested in North Korean people,\u201d says Joo. \u201cThe young generation still think North Korea is a foreign country. I strongly believe that we are the same people, that it is one nation.\u201d It all started when Joo was invited on Now on My Way to Meet You by a friend in 2012. In the variety show, a panel of around 15 young North Korean women, referred to as \u201cbeauties\u201d by the hosts, sit primly in a pastel studio and chat about life under the regime. They share stories about cooking and the weather, public executions, the military and prison camps \u2013 all to a soundtrack of gunshots. \u201cThe government is bad, not the people,\u201d says Joo. \u201cNot everyone worships Kim Jong-un. With more exposure, people will get to know North Koreans better.\u201d In one episode, a woman explains how she lived off trash found in villages after escaping, while another remembers her neighbour being tied to a stake, tortured and publicly executed for owning smuggled CDs. Kim Hye-Sook, who spent 28 years in a prison camp from the ages of 13 to 41, talks about torture in the camp and the 4m-high electrified fences. She never knew the charges against her until she escaped and it emerged that her grandfather had tried to defect during the Korean war. \u201cMany people have started to pay attention to the show on a human rights level,\u201d says Joo. \u201cI know some are watching it secretly in North Korea too.\u201d Now on My Way to Meet You also helps escapees track down their long-lost family members. One contestant was reunited with her sister for the first time in more than a decade after telling her story on TV. \u201cDuring those harsh 15 years, the young girl who got left behind in China lost her mother tongue,\u201d said the soft-voiced narrator as the family hugged and sobbed. \u201cHowever, she never, not even once, has forgotten her mother and her sister\u2019s faces.\u201d There are men on the show too. One middle-aged man, who was caught leaving the country, was separated from his wife and daughters. He later learned they were sold for human trafficking in China. \u201cHoney, if I ever see you again, I will really love you with all my heart,\u201d he said, as the entire set collapsed in tears. \u201cPlease, even if it\u2019s just once, please let us meet each other again alive.\u201d The show was such a hit that it sparked a number of other North Korea-focused reality shows. \u201cThis is the first time a South Korean audience has been able to access these issues through the softer angle of entertainment shows,\u201d says Sokeel Park, director of research at Liberty in North Korea, a non-profit organisation that helps defectors resettle in China or the US. \u201cTV producers feel it is their mission to do something about the social chasm. No matter what happens in the future, whether there is reunification or not, TV can help the north and south have good relations.\u201d There are around 28,500 DPRK refugees in South Korea, according to Park \u2013 but not everyone is entertained. Some North Koreans don\u2019t want to be on TV because the regime could punish their families back home. Still, the majority of defectors change their names and those that appear on TV tend to use stage names. \u201cJust being able to be a normal person from North Korea talking about life,\u201d continues Park, \u201cthe harrowing aspects but also how dating works, how people get around government restrictions \u2013 it\u2019s a way to hear it from the horse\u2019s mouth.\u201d Other shows include Moranbong Club, a comic talk and talent show hosted by two dapper men in round spectacles with a panel of North Korean contestants who sing, dance and get quizzed about life. \u201cWe need to tell people about the real North Korea,\u201d says one contestant, while another, a former army officer, said he used to check teenage girls to see if their hymens were broken before allowing them in the army, which refuses entry to non-virgins. The newest of the bunch is Good Life, an adventure-cum-dating show in which North Korean women and South Korean men are left to fend for themselves in the wild. The women chop wood and cook fish while the men crack jokes. They tell stories, weep, arm-wrestle and play the harp as cartoon speech bubbles appear around them and circus-like cymbal crashes sound. It\u2019s very animated for a countryside romp. They\u2019re not all so flashy. Good Friends, sponsored by the Institute for Unification Education, brings North and South Korean teens together to chat about cultural differences. It\u2019s so educational that it\u2019s like a cross between an oral exam, a job interview and a diplomacy tutorial. Hosted by a fortysomething, dad-looking host, the teenagers sit round a wooden table and discuss banking, real estate and the North Korean government. Sometimes funny, they make mistakes, correct each other and mildly flirt in the most respectable, my-parents-are-watching sort of way. To Chang Yong Seok, a researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, Good Friends is better than most. \u201cThis programme puts the focus on building a good relationship between North Koreans and South, not the abnormal aspects of the north,\u201d he says. Chang feels that entertainment-driven shows such as Now on My Way to Meet You and Moranbong Club portray North Korea in a strange, freakshow light. \u201cCoupled with sensational journalism, they could seriously make matters worse,\u201d he says. \u201cHow can we imagine peaceful co-existence with a strange and eccentric state?\u201d Since it\u2019s difficult for North Koreans to integrate into South Korean society, highlighting cultural differences on Good Friends is a positive step in Chang\u2019s eyes. \u201cMost immigrants from the north are regarded as latent spies or aliens, so the road to the white collar job is very narrow,\u201d he says. \u201cIn other words, they stand on the border, not belonging to any side.\u201d As for Joo, she recently enrolled at Korea University majoring in media studies and hosts two radio programmes on the Christian station FEBC Korea, which she used to pirate in the DPRK. \u201cI hope people in North Korea listen to my broadcasts and long for freedom, as I did.\u201d",
