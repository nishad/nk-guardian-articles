    "content": "In the lead-up to North Korea\u2019s latest missile test, Donald Trump had battled to convince Kim Jong-un he was picking a fight with the wrong guy. The US president pounded Syria with 59 Tomahawk missiles and then ordered a naval \u201carmada\u201d into the waters around the Korean peninsula. He dropped the \u201cmother of all bombs\u201d on eastern Afghanistan and used Twitter to hammer home his message. \u201cNorth Korea is looking for trouble,\u201d the US president tweeted last week as Kim\u2019s technicians made the final preparations for Sunday\u2019s botched but nevertheless defiant test. But experts say Pyongyang\u2019s latest act has underlined the futility of the billionaire\u2019s efforts to bully Kim Jong-un into abandoning his nuclear ambitions. \u201cThere is a problem with playing the military threat [card] with North Korea because they are inclined to call the bluff,\u201d said John Delury, a North Korea expert from Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they tested because of the threats. But bringing a naval strike group doesn\u2019t help if your goal is to put off a test. If anything you are increasing the odds.\u201d Trump supporters claim his apparent strategy of using spectacular shows of military might to cow the North Korean dictator and convince the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to crack down on his ally is paying off. \u201cDisplays of American power matter. A lot,\u201d Daniel Blumenthal, a China specialist from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative thinktank, argued on Twitter, describing the strikes on Syria and Afghanistan as \u201cvery much messages to Xi and Kim\u201d. Some observers point to a recent editorial in a Communist party-controlled newspaper, the Global Times, as proof that Trump has finally convinced Beijing to rein in Kim Jong-un by dramatically tightening sanctions. Delury, however, said there was no evidence to suggest Xi was prepared to do anything more than \u201cincrease some sanctions here and there\u201d. \u201cThe Global Times can write all the editorials it wants but China\u2019s approach on this is consistent\u201d. Beijing\u2019s message to Trump was crystal clear, he said: \u201cCool down.\u201d In fact, Delury claimed Trump\u2019s sabre-rattling rhetoric and erratic use of force would only strengthen Kim\u2019s determination to develop an effective nuclear deterrent that might spare him the fate of Saddam Hussein or Muammar Gaddafi. \u201cIt\u2019s really just playing Pyongyang\u2019s game. It is a waste of time and the Trump administration should move onto a more promising avenue to solve the problem ... Since they have nothing to lose and we have everything to lose, they win every game of chicken.\u201d Leonid Petrov, a North Korea specialist at the Australian National University, said that with its latest missile launch \u201cthe message from North Korea is that despite US posturing they are not going to abandon their missile programme\u201d. Petrov said he was not surprised Kim Jong-un had chosen not to commemorate the 105th anniversary of the birth of the founder of North Korea, his grandfather Kim Il-sung, with an anticipated sixth nuclear test. \u201cGiven the physical damage that would cause to nearby areas, it would have been unusual for a loyal, filial grandson to order a nuclear test on such an auspicious day,\u201d he said. But when that test does come it would prove the day of reckoning for Trump\u2019s more aggressive approach towards North Korea. \u201cIf the US responds with an attack, that would confirm Kim\u2019s claims that he is surrounded by hostile forces that are determined to carry out a pre-emptive strike,\u201d Petrov said. \u201cThe moment of truth for the US will be whether it strikes [in response to a nuclear test] and provokes a resumption of the Korean war at the expense of South Korean security, or stands down and betrays its weakness.\u201d \u201cWhat would the US do? Withdraw, hang around or strike?\u201d Petrov asked. \u201cThe ball is in the Americans\u2019 court.\u201d",
