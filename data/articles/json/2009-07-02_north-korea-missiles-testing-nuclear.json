    "content": "North Korea test-fired two short-range missiles from its east coast today, South Korean media reported, as a US envoy was in Beijing to discuss new sanctions against the reclusive regime. South Korean intelligence experts had anticipated tests, including of banned ballistic rockets, from two sites in early July. New missile launches could exacerbate tensions running high since Pyongyang's 25 May underground nuclear test and a series of missile firings. The UN security council adopted a tough sanctions resolution last month in response to the nuclear test. Philip Goldberg, a former US ambassador, who is in charge of co-ordinating the implementation of sanctions, was meeting representatives from the Chinese foreign ministry and other relevant ministries. As China is Pyongyang's closest ally and largest source of fuel and food aid, its co-operation is crucial in persuading North Korea to resume nuclear disarmament talks. The new UN resolution calls on UN members to request inspections of ships suspected of carrying prohibited cargo. A North Korean ship came under intense scrutiny for more than a week by the US navy as it was detected heading toward Burma with suspicious cargo. On Sunday, the Kang Nam 1, the first vessel monitored under UN sanctions, turned around and headed back north. Pyongyang said that any interception of its ships would be considered a declaration of war. China has sent its own envoy, vice foreign minister Wu Dawei, on an extended trip to Russia, the US, Japan and South Korea to talk about the Korean nuclear situation and how to restart the six-party disarmament talks. \"The purpose of Wu Dawei's visit is to exchange views with relevant parties on the nuclear issues on the Korean peninsula and the situation in northeast Asia,\" said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang. Separately, North and South Korea ended their latest talks over a troubled joint industrial project, apparently without progress, and failed to set a date for the next round of talks, South Korea's unification ministry said. Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung said the two sides met for a little over one hour in the morning in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. The countries have been at odds over the fate of a South Korean worker who has been detained in the north since March for allegedly denouncing its political system. The north has rejected Seoul's repeated calls for the worker's freedom. It has also demanded that South Korean companies sharply increase wages for North Korean workers and fees paid for the use of the land. As relations with South Korea deteriorated, the north halted all key joint projects except for the South Korean-run complex at Kaesong, a prominent symbol of past attempts at reconciliation. It is believed North Korea is highly likely to test-fire a barrage of missiles in coming days, a move that would aggravate the already high tensions following Pyongyang's nuclear test and UN sanctions. The north is expected to launch short or medium-range missiles, including banned ballistic rockets, from two sites on its east coast in early July, the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo reported, citing an unidentified intelligence source. Last month, Pyongyang designated a no-sail zone off its east coast for military drills through to 10 July. Media reports have said the missile launches could come around 4 July, the US Independence Day. The north tested a long-range missile on that day in 2006. Today's reports say North Korea has test-fired two short-range missiles. Yonhap news agency reported that the north fired two ground-to-ship missiles from its east coast. The report gave no further details. South Korea's joint chiefs of staff could not immediately confirm the report. North Korea had earlier issued a no-sail zone in waters off its east coast through 10 July.",
