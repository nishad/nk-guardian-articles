    "content": "Malcolm Turnbull has said the latest North Korean missile launch over Japan proves the fresh sanctions imposed by the United Nations security council are working. \u201cI think this latest missile launch over Japan and the violent outbursts of North Korean propaganda, threatening opinion and the United States overnight \u2013 this shows that the sanctions are working,\u201d Turnbull told reporters on Friday. But the prime minister quickly backtracked when asked if, based on his own argument, further sanctions would only place Japan at further risk. \u201cI don\u2019t accept that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe critical thing is to continue to apply economic pressure on North Korea to bring the regime to its senses. Nobody wants to see a war on the Korean peninsula.\u201d Turnbull said he was counting on the rogue state\u2019s survival instinct to prevent war. \u201cIf Kim Jong-un were to start a war, to attack the United States or one of its allies, he would be signing a suicide note,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be the end for his government, and thousands and thousands of people would die. \u201cIt would be a catastrophe and that is why it is vitally important to maintain this economic pressure on North Korea.\u201d Turnbull once again reinforced Australia\u2019s commitment to the Anzus treaty, under which Australia would come to the aid of the United States, and vice versa, in the event of an attack. But he said no such formal arrangement existed with Japan, and he would not speculate \u201cabout any other scenarios\u201d. The UN security council unanimously agreed this week to further limit North Korea\u2019s exports and imports, on top of what were already being called the \u201ctoughest ever\u201d sanctions. Turnbull again called for China to do more, but did not go as far as to suggest it turn off the oil supply, as he did last month. On that occasion he was rebuked in the Chinese media for \u201cself-righteously blah blah blahing\u201d, Fairfax Media reported. China and Russia have veto powers within the security council, and have faced increasing pressure to use their influence to bring Kim to heel. \u201cThe country with the greatest economic leverage over North Korea is China,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cChina \u2013 North Korea is not to China what East Germany was to the old Soviet Union. The Chinese are dismayed by the conduct of North Korea, but they have been allies for a very long time. \u201cA lot of history there. But it is important for China to continue increasing these sanctions until we see a change of course by North Korea and it is good to see that they are doing that. \u201cThey are imposing the sanctions that were recently imposed and they have voted for the latest round.\u201d Turnbull spoke to the media shortly after a phone conversation with the UK prime minister, Theresa May, their first conversation since his visit to London in July. In a \u201cvery friendly call\u201d, the two leaders discussed global security challenges, including North Korea, and agreed that the recent sanctions were the best way forward.",
