    "content": "An analysis of US president Donald Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un\u2019s proposed meeting has dominated discussion among our readers today. Gary Younge\u2019s opinion piece on the undemocratic nature of the EU and David Oyelowo\u2019s thoughts on his new film role have also got people talking. To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We\u2019ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un believe they are winning \u2013 and the risks of that are epic Donald Trump has accepted an invitation from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to hold an unprecedented summit meeting to discuss the future of the embattled regime\u2019s nuclear and missile programme. \u2018I am no fan of Mr Trump, but this really is a good idea\u2019 I am no fan of Mr Trump, but this really is a good idea. Diplomacy needs to be the way forward. A very unusual move but impressive nonetheless. If they manage to make positive progress, that would be historic. I would like to be optimistic about this and can\u2019t see why so many people think this meeting will be a bad idea. f00l \u2018Trump\u2019s too thick to understand the intricacies of foreign power plays\u2019 The orange moron doesn\u2019t even know when he\u2019s being played. Of course the North Koreans are happy to meet, their nuclear weapons program is is all but complete. What they want is an equal footing and will never surrender their arsenal, if anyone is \u2018winning \u2018 its Kim, Trumps too thick to understand the intricacies of foreign power plays and would consider the meeting a success based on the desert served. mrsydney21 \u2018Even if Hillary was president the same thing would probably be happening\u2019 I don\u2019t think this is a Trump thing, more a time thing. Even if Hillary was president the same thing would probably be happening right now. It seems clear to me that this was North Korea\u2019s plan all along, their nuclear program probably isn\u2019t as advanced as we might think but is merely a bargaining chip to end the South Korean-US annual military drills and ease sanctions. Yorkshireman40 The shambles of Brexit diverts attention from the EU\u2019s democratic deficit Gary Young says the EU has seemed stable in the face of Britain\u2019s petulance, but we must not forget its lack of democracy, writes Gary Younge. \u2018Why has the EU not mandated a second referendum on its own terms\u2019 I am a little shocked that after the last two or three years of leaver mendacity that the Guardian\u2019s best columnist is still buying into all their myths. If the UK has no sovereignty how is it leaving? Why has the EU not mandated a second referendum on its own terms given that it must have this power? matti90210 \u2018It is the UK that has a more concerning democratic deficit\u2019 Considering that every Scottish voting area returned a majority remain in the EU vote, it is the UK that has a more concerning democratic deficit. We have our own government in Holyrood say the UK is violating our own citizens equality rights yet don\u2019t have the authority to do anything. We have trident in our country despite our government being opposed to it, we have a party leading in Westminster that our votes have no influence over and so on... so please, you can complain when the EU forces you to have nukes on the Thames and appoints a PM that goes against your country\u2019s voting results. cloud1234 David Oyelowo: \u2018The Ryan Goslings get to break earlier than black actors do\u2019 Actor David Oyelowo In new cartel caper Gringo, the British star of Selma brings his perspective to yet another character that wasn\u2019t \u2018written as black\u2019 \u2013 just don\u2019t ask him to play the best friend. \u2018It\u2019s being going on for many years\u2019 If you go to the National Theatre or RSC, you will see people playing roles which traditionally are a different ethnicity to that of the actor (such as an early 20th century Devon mother, played by an Asian actor), and sometimes of a different sex. It\u2019s being going on for many years. With more contemporary drama, there is very little reason why a role should be conceived as being black, white, or whatever. Neither does the creation of a black role have to come with a huge back story \u2013 they don\u2019t have to demonstrate an \u201cinteresting interplay of race, class and colonialism\u201d. That\u2019s a bit like asking \u201cwhere do you come from? ... No, I mean, really come from?\u201d. The characters should be developed to meet the needs of the drama. Tongariro1 \u2018Casting ethnic minority and women actors into empowering and inspirational characters means they lose out on loser roles\u2019 This character, Harold seems to be an amiable but pathetic and frustrated loser. The current ethos of casting ethnic minority and women actors into empowering and inspirational characters means they loose out on loser roles. Eddie Murphy is big enough and comedic enough to play losers. Could you imagine black actors taking on a project like Midnight Cowboy? loopine Comments have been edited for length.
