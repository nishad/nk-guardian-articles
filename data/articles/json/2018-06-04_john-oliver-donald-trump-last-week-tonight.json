    "content": "On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed the prospects for the highly anticipated summit between Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un. \u201cWe begin with North Korea, voted \u2018Top Korea\u2019 by \u2018We Meant It Geographically Magazine\u2019,\u201d the host said. \u201cThis week, the June 12 summit between the US and North Korea was suddenly back on after Trump met with a North Korean envoy who brought him this gigantic, comically oversized letter from Kim Jong-un.\u201d Showing a photo of the president grinning widely with the letter in hand, Oliver continued: \u201cAs if smiling while holding a letter from a dictator were not enough of a propaganda coup for North Korea, the president then raved about the letter to the press.\u201d In a clip shown from a gaggle between Trump and reporters, the president was asked about the contents of the letter, which was sent just weeks after the 12 June summit was cancelled due to what Trump called the \u201ctremendous anger and open hostility displayed\u201d by Pyongyang and the North Korean government\u2019s objection to joint US-South Korean military exercises. \u201cIt was a very interesting letter,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand at some point it may be appropriate, I\u2019ll be able to give it to you.\u201d \u201cAs infuriating a president as Trump is, he would be an even worse Moses,\u201d Oliver joked. \u201cOh, wouldn\u2019t you like to see what\u2019s on these tablets?\u201d \u201cAnd if that wasn\u2019t weird enough,\u201d the host went on, \u201cjust eight minutes after calling the contents of the letter interesting, this happened.\u201d Oliver proceeded to play a segment from the same clip, where Trump tells reporters: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the letter yet ... I may be in for a big surprise, folks.\u201d \u201cYeah, you might though!\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBecause you just agreed to a summit without reading the contents of the letter that supposedly convinced you to do it. So, worst-case scenario, it\u2019s a declaration of war. Best-case scenario, it says: \u2018Donald, it\u2019s me. I have run away to North Korea and I am never coming back. Melania, [your third wife].\u201d",
