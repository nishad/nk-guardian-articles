    "content": "North Korea is a country living under the watchful eyes of its great leaders \u2013 millions of portraits of them. In every home, office and school and in every public place hang pictures of the deceased former heads of state, Kim Jong\u2013il and Kim Il\u2013sung, a constant reminder of the Kim dynasty and their power over the country since the DPRK was first established in 1948. Je Son-lee, a defector who fled the country in 2011, explains that the two men are now treated like gods: \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to have their portraits, in order to be with them all the time. It\u2019s almost equivalent to having the cross or the statues of Jesus at churches,\u201d he says. Jun Yoo-sung, who defected from the DPRK in 2005, says that images of the Kims are considered sacred: \u201cYou should respect more than anything else,\u201d he explains. To maintain their sacred status, images of the leaders are rigorously policed: regulations state portraits must hang from a wall with nothing else on it \u2013 no other decorations are allowed \u2013 in a prominent and central position in the room. Frames must also be hung high up, so that no one can stand higher than the great leaders. The only rooms that are exempt from these rules are in hotels, Je says. Citizens are also obligated to clean the pictures at least every few days. In schools, the \u201csecretary of ideology\u201d inspects to make sure frames are cleaned regularly, and in every neighbourhood a member from the Workers\u2019 Party is often assigned to check on every household. \u201cIf dust is found in those portraits, you\u2019re subject to pay a fine \u2013 the thicker the dust is the more you have to pay,\u201d Je says. \u2018I began to look at them with fear\u2019 North Koreans learn to revere and fear the faces looming over them from a young age. \u201cThe first thing I can remember my parents said about the portraits was: \u2018You should take very good care of [them]. You will get into big trouble if they fall off by mistake,\u201d says Jun. \u201cBecause my parents warned me so much about those portraits, I began to look at [them] with fear.\u201d Je says he was taught to praise the pictures as he was able to talk, and he grew up believing the portraits were watching him. \u201cOf course, those perceptions change as you grow up. I stopped thinking that they were always looking at me and watching my every move. I began to realise that they were just photos.\u201d Some defectors make the comparison to philosopher Jeremy Bentham\u2019s design for a British prison, called the panopticon, a space created where inmates are watched at all times, as a substitute for brute force or coercion. \u201cIt\u2019s simply panopticism \u2013 to show that the leader is looking after (and over) everyone and is ever-present in their lives,\u201d explained a source who currently works within the DPRK but who wished to remain anonymous. According the Andrei Lankov\u2019s book North of the DMZ: Essays on Daily Life in North Korea, every newlywed couple in the country receives a pair of portraits \u2013 made by government-approved artists at the Mansudae Art Studio \u2013 on their wedding day, gifted by their district\u2019s Workers Party office. Cults of admiration North Korea propaganda expert Gianluca Spezza compares the omnipresence of the former leaders to countries such as Thailand or Saudi Arabia, where the dynastic ruling families are also treated with a reverence bordering on worship, and the crime of insulting the king is punished harshly. Spezza also points to Marxist-Leninist states throughout history, who have similarly also built a tradition of political reverence, from the veneration of Fidel Castro in Cuba to the all-consuming worship enjoyed by Mao Zedong in China or Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania. \u201cGenerally, it helps to visualise a figure in order to remind people of [their] presence,\u201d Spezza says. But he also points out it\u2019s not only autocratic countries that that revere images of their leaders, giving the example of the US and the UK. \u201cThe difference is, all these places have a space for respect and \u2018worship\u2019 of authority in public places and spaces,\u201d he says. \u201cNorth Korea went a step further, making this an important gesture to be nurtured in private spaces, and even on the physical body of the individual, with the [use of] badges and pins.\u201d Stories of everyday citizens \u2013 often children \u2013 dying to save beloved pictures from floods or fire are common in state media. \u201cWhen a house was set on fire, some child was found to have been burnt to death holding on to those portraits,\u201d says Jun. \u201cOf course, such incidents are used for North Korean propaganda.\u201d But attitudes could be changing. Defectors say the portraits have begun shifting from genuine symbols of patriotism to just another of the many obligations citizens must carry out in service to the state. Strict rules about folding images or desecrating images of the leader are increasingly being ignored in the interests of day-to-day practicality, sources say. \u201cIt\u2019s considered to be disrespectful,\u201d said a source inside the country who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cHowever there are plenty of times it [happens]: bank notes get folded, newspapers get folded. It isn\u2019t supposed to happen but it is very common.\u201d \u201cWhen the regime was popular, people thought of the portraits dearly,\u201d said Jun. \u201cBut, now they seem to treat them as pieces of annoying frames that you would get rid of if you were allowed to.\u201d A version of this article first appeared on NK News",
