    "content": "Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has secured a strong mandate for his hard line against North Korea and room to push for revision of the country\u2019s pacifist constitution after his party crushed untested opposition parties in Sunday\u2019s general election. Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito were on course to win 311 seats, keeping its two-thirds \u201csupermajority\u201d in the 465-member lower house, an exit poll by TBS television showed. Some other broadcasters had the ruling bloc slightly below the two-thirds mark. A supermajority would allow Abe to propose changes to the constitution, which currently restricts its military to a defensive role. Most voters, however, oppose reform. After a day that saw millions of voters brave driving rain and powerful winds brought on by Typhoon Lan, Abe\u2019s election gamble appeared to have paid off, after he called the vote more than a year earlier than scheduled. While Abe\u2019s personal popularity remains low, support for his uncompromising stance on North Korea has risen following the regime\u2019s recent launch of two ballistic missiles over the northern island of Hokkaido and its threat to \u201csink\u201d Japan. Abe said he would accept the result with \u201chumility\u201d after his personal popularity ratings plummeted in the summer amid two cronyism scandals. The official result is expected early on Monday, with some districts reporting delays in delivering ballot boxes due to the typhoon. An initial challenge by the Party of Hope, formed only late last month by the populist governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, petered out as prospective supporters stayed with the the incumbent LDP. The public broadcaster, NHK, said Hope was on course to win between 38 and 59 seats, with another new opposition force, the Constitutional Democratic party (CDP), expected to fare slightly better and become Japan\u2019s main opposition. Hope was expected to win fewer seats than some pundits had predicted at the start of the campaign, but was forecast to end up with enough to signal a shift to the right in the composition of Japan\u2019s powerful lower house. \u201cThe situation in the world is not stable in many aspects and I believe the LDP is the only party we can depend on,\u201d Kyoko Ichida, a Tokyo resident, said after casting her vote. Abe, who has emerged as Donald Trump\u2019s key ally in the president\u2019s tough line against Pyongyang, said \u201call options\u201d \u2013 including military force \u2013 remained on the table. \u201cAt a time when North Korea is threatening us and increasing tensions, we must never waver,\u201d he said in his final campaign speech on Saturday. \u201cWe must not yield to the threat of North Korea.\u201d Sunday\u2019s victory will keep alive Abe\u2019s long-held quest to revise Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution to officially recognise the self-defence forces (SDF) as a bona fide military. But aware of the strength of public opposition, Abe said on Sunday that he had dropped his 2020 deadline for the revision. \u201cFirst, I want to deepen debate and have as many people as possible agree,\u201d he said in a TV interview. \u201cThat should be our priority.\u201d He added that he would \u201cdeal firmly\u201d with North Korea. Any weakening of Japan\u2019s pacifist credo is expected to anger China and South Korea, where many still harbour bitter memories of Japanese militarism in the first half of the 20th century. Liberals in Japan, meanwhile, fear that \u201cnormalising\u201d the country\u2019s armed forces will lead to their involvement in US-led wars. Changing the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Japanese Diet and a simple majority in a national referendum. The ruling coalition will seek support for constitutional reform from members of the Hope party, which attracted MPs from the Democrats, Japan\u2019s biggest opposition party until, wracked with division, it imploded earlier this month. Conservative members fled to Hope, while more liberal MPs joined forces to form the left-of-centre CDP, led by Yukio Edano, Japan\u2019s top government spokesman at the time of the March 2011 nuclear disaster. Edano\u2019s party wants to protect Japan\u2019s pacifist principles and restore \u201cdecency\u201d to public life. \u201cWe have only just started,\u201d Edano told NHK. \u201cWe want to do something different and reflect the voices of the people rather than just politicians, and to build a grassroots movement.\u201d He added that would do all he could to prevent Japanese troops from engaging in collective self-defence. The LDP is due to hold presidential elections next September, but Sunday\u2019s victory means Abe is virtually assured of retaining the leadership of his party for another three years and going on to become the longest-serving prime minister in Japanese history. Analysts said regional tensions centred on North Korea had dissuaded many voters from taking a leap into the political unknown. \u201cFactors such as uncertainty over North Korea are likely to drive voters towards the current government, which is seen as the conservative choice,\u201d said Katsunori Kitakura at SuMi Trust financial consultants. Edano accused Abe of being high-handed in calling an election more than a year early. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake now is whether we will have a politics of arrogance or a grassroots politics that lifts society up from the bottom,\u201d he said. After an initial surge in support for her party, Koike \u2013 who has long been tipped to become Japan\u2019s first female leader \u2013 faced criticism for refusing to resign as governor and run in the election as a potential prime ministerial candidate. The former news anchor, who has promised to \u201creset\u201d Japan, reportedly spent election day in Paris attending a climate change meeting in her role as Tokyo governor. She told NHK that she was expecting a \u201cvery severe result\u201d, adding, \u201cAs the person who launched the party, I will take responsibility for it.\u201d Some analysts described the result as not so much a victory for the LDP as a defeat for a divided opposition. \u201cThe LDP was victorious simply because the opposition couldn\u2019t form a united front,\u201d Mikitaka Masuyama at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies told AFP. Sunday\u2019s result means Abe is expected to proceed with a controversial rise in the consumption or sales tax in late 2019. He has said the increase, from 8% to 10%, is unavoidable if Japan is to meet rising social security costs and, eventually, pay back its huge public debt, now more than double the size of its economy. As a sop to voters who oppose the tax hike, Abe vowed to spend some of the extra revenue on pre-school education and nursing care for the country\u2019s growing population of over-65s. Kyodo news agency estimated turnout at 53.7%, one point higher than the record low in the last lower house election in 2014.",
