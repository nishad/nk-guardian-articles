    "content": "South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, has credited Donald Trump for creating the political backdrop to this week\u2019s inter-Korea talks, and echoed the US president\u2019s warning that Pyongyang faced more pressure if it continued to conduct missile and nuclear tests. Speaking a day after senior North and South Korean officials met for the first time in more than two years, Moon suggested that US-led pressure on North Korea over the past year had helped bring the two sides together. \u201cI think President Trump deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks, and I want to show my gratitude,\u201d he told reporters in Seoul. \u201cIt could be the result of US-led sanctions and pressure.\u201d Trump had already claimed credit for facilitating the talks \u2013 which focused on North Korea\u2019s participation in next month\u2019s Winter Olympics \u2013 saying at the weekend: \u201cIf I weren\u2019t involved, they wouldn\u2019t be talking about the Olympics right now, they\u2019d be doing no talking.\u201d Moon\u2019s praise for Trump is being seen as an attempt to ease US concerns that the recent thaw in cross-border ties could drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington. On Tuesday, North Korea agreed to send a large delegation to the Games, which open in Pyeongchang on 9 February. The two sides also agreed to hold military talks in an attempt to prevent an accidental conflict on the peninsula. While Moon has been more open to the idea of engagement than either of his two conservative predecessors, he said Seoul and Washington shared a common aim: the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. \u201cThis initial round of talks is for the improvement of relations between North and South Korea,\u201d he said. \u201cOur task going forward is to draw North Korea to talks aimed at the denuclearisation of the North. That is our basic stance, and that will never be given up.\u201d He added: \u201cWe cannot say talks are the sole answer. If North Korea engages in provocations again or does not show sincerity in resolving this issue, the international community will continue applying strong pressure and sanctions.\u201d The White House responded positively to Tuesday\u2019s talks, held on the southern side of the border village of Panmunjom, with the state department saying it would be interested in joining future negotiations provided the goal was ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons. Moon said he was open to meeting his counterpart, Kim Jong-un, but he would not engage in \u201ctalks for the sake of talks\u201d. \u201cTo hold a summit, the right conditions must be created and certain outcomes must be guaranteed,\u201d he said. Trump recently expressed a willingness to meet Kim, but Washington has said that Pyongyang must cease nuclear and missile tests for a significant period before any negotiations can take place. Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said Moon had been right to praise Trump. \u201cBy doing that, he can help the US build logic for moving toward negotiations and turning around the state of affairs in the future, so when they were ready to talk to the North, they can say the North came out of isolation because the sanctions were effective,\u201d he said.",
