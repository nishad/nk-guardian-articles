    "content": "President Barack Obama picked three of the most popular YouTube content creators for an interview on Thursday and came in for a surprise grilling on major economic and social issues, including healthcare, college education, Washington\u2019s privileging of business interest and the Sony hacking. The questions, frequently holding the president to account, came from YouTube personalities who have previously touted videos like \u201cThe five worst places to vomit\u201d and \u201cMy push-up bra will help me get my man\u201d. But there was a notable absence of the quirkiness and outrageous manner that has led GloZell Green to gain 5 million followers on social media, or Hank Green\u2019s Vlog Brothers YouTube channel to gain 2.4 million subscribers. There were scattered moments, such as when GloZell Green accidentally called Michelle Obama the president\u2019s \u201cfirst wife\u201d instead of the first lady, and when she cheekily said Ra\u00fal Castro \u201cputs the \u2018dick\u2019 in dictator\u201d. Instead, in the 45-minute #YouTubeAsksObama interviews, the president fielded questions on inequality, college education, the economy, same-sex marriage rights and unemployment. Google, which owns YouTube, showed charts of search trends that demonstrated that economic issues including college, taxes, housing, employment and education were the most-searched during the session. The questions started out tough \u2013 tougher, some might say, than Obama would get from veteran Washington reporters. The first question, from YouTube star Hank Green, was tough enough that the president paused and swallowed before answering. \u201cI watched the State of the Union. A lot of interesting ideas there. I\u2019m not the only person who\u2019s said this: I\u2019m a little worried that none of them are at all politically feasible. Am I wrong?\u201d Obama countered that Republican cooperation could be possible on issues including infrastructure. He added that he wanted to \u201cframe the debate\u201d so that even if Washington delays adoption of his policies, the political debate is ignited around the country, as with the many states who have raised minimum wage on their own. Green\u2019s second question, about \u201cmiddle-class economics\u201d, focused on the cynicism many Americans feel about Washington\u2019s closeness with powerful business interests, particularly \u201ctaking former leaders of industry and putting them in positions where they\u2019re regulating the industry they used to be part of\u201d. Obama did not reply directly, but noted that he was able to \u201ctake away money that was being siphoned off by banks for student loan programs and billions of dollars are suddenly directly going to students\u201d. He added: \u201cToo often lobbyists and special interests are able to block efforts to make the system fair ... but our history shows that when people get engaged and vote, change happens. It doesn\u2019t always happen immediately, but it happens.\u201d Green finished his interview by asking Obama to sign a picture of him with a receipt showing that Obamacare had saved him nearly $1,100 a month on medical bills. GloZell Green asked Obama about the relationship between young black men and white cops \u2013 or, as she put it, \u201cthe po po\u201d. Obama responded that young black men often look older than they are, and that training for police \u2013 many of whom, he stressed, are professional and hardworking \u2013 should include awareness of unconscious biases. Obama also sent a message to those who oppose same-sex marriage, an issue that would guarantee equal economic rights to gay couples. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, they\u2019re not bothering you,\u201d the president told viewers who might oppose gay couples being recognized by the law. When GloZell Green asked Obama what he believed his legacy should be, he cited the economic recovery during his time in office. \u201cWe saved an economy that was on the brink of depression,\u201d Obama said, citing more jobs, 10 million people with health insurance and other economic statistics that have been trending upward. \u201cEvery day I wake up and I ask myself, in particular, how can I make sure that folks who are working hard can not just survive, but how can they thrive? How can they get ahead?\u201d Bethany Mota, a 19-year-old YouTube star known for her Macbarbie07 channel that details hair, makeup and shopping decisions, asked the president about the rising cost of college education. Obama reprised some of his policy proposals, including capping student loan payments to 10% of income. He directed his answer to Mota\u2019s retail expertise. \u201cYou can figure out a way to pay for college, but you have to be a smart shopper. You have to figure out how much a school costs. You should have some sense whether you can get in-state tuition versus going to a school out of state.\u201d The three YouTube stars also asked the president about North Korea, Cuba and the reign of terror of Boko Haram.",
