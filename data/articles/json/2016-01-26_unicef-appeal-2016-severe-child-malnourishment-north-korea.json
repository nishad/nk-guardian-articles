    "content": "About 25,000 children in North Korea require immediate treatment for malnutrition after a drought cut food production by a fifth and the government reduced rations, Unicef has warned. The UN\u2019s children\u2019s fund is asking for \u00a312.6m ($18m) in donations for its North Korea work as part of a global \u00a31.9bn humanitarian appeal for children. It said the money needed for its work had doubled in three years, driven by global conflicts and extreme weather that were forcing growing numbers of children from their homes and exposing millions more to food shortages, violence, disease and abuse. For the first time, it said a quarter of the worldwide appeal would go towards educating children in emergencies, focusing on 5 million children affected by the Syrian civil war, which is now in its fifth year. In North Korea, Unicef said severe drought during 2015 in four agricultural provinces led to a 20% reduction in crop production compared with 2014. \u201cThe impact of this will continue into 2016. Cereal rations were reduced, impacting the nutritional and health status of women and children,\u201d it said in a statement. International aid appeals for North Korea are often severely underfunded as foreign governments try to pressure Pyongyang to curtail its nuclear ambitions. Aid workers warn that whenever North Korea conducts nuclear weapon trials \u2013 such as the hydrogen bomb test this month \u2013 foreign funds dry up. During 2015, Unicef received only 38% of the \u00a315.5m North Korea appeal. The hermit nation suffered a famine in the 1990s that killed as many as a million people, and the country still relies heavily on foreign aid. \u201cThe severe drought last year reduced food production and children\u2019s access to safe, clean water,\u201d Unicef\u2019s representative in North Korea, Timothy Schaffter, told the Guardian. \u201cWithout safe water, children are at greater risk of diarrhoea, which is a leading cause of malnutrition and death. We have reports of a 72% increase in diarrhoea among children under five in the most severely drought-affected provinces. \u201cIf we are unable to secure additional funding, our supplies of essential medicines will start running out in March, nutrition supplies will be depleted by mid-year, and our highly successful immunisation programme will run out of basic vaccines before the year\u2019s end.\u201d In its global 2016 appeal, the bulk of the funds sought would provide life-saving aid needed for Syria and the resultant refugee crisis in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, Unicef said. It called for \u00a3126m for children in Yemen, where 10 million children are in urgent need of humanitarian aid, and said it needed \u00a317.9m to help children in Burundi, one of the poorest countries in the world, and where a political crisis has led to street fighting and mass displacement. About one in nine children worldwide are living in conflict zones, said Unicef which warned of donor fatigue: protracted crises in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan were all less than 40% funded in 2015. \u201cIn the past few months I have seen with my own eyes children pushed beyond the boundaries of human suffering in Burundi, north-east Nigeria and along the migrant and refugee route in Europe,\u201d said Afshan Khan, Unicef\u2019s director of emergency programmes. Extreme weather posed a further risk to children. \u201cClimate change, deforestation and the worsening El Ni\u00f1o weather system are pointing to more frequent and intense disasters in 2016, impacting a larger number of children in east Asia and the Pacific,\u201d Unicef regional emergency adviser Carmen van Heese said. The impact of El Ni\u00f1o in the Pacific islands had caused typhoons and floods, Unicef said. Drought warnings are in force for Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu and Palau. \u201cChildren and families are struggling to cope with one of the worst El Ni\u00f1o cycles ever recorded, with more frequent and intense cyclones expected in 2016,\u201d Unicef said, warning of further malnutrition and crop failures.",
