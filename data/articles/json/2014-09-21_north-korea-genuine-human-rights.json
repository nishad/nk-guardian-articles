    "content": "Name: Genuine human rights. Age: Always! For ever! We have always had them, do you understand? Appearance: Always, for ever, everywhere, nothing changes. You sound very \u2026 impassioned. That is because we are sick of the western world \u2013 filthy, US ally scum \u2013 constantly insinuating that we are a violently cruel country constantly perpetrating the worst kind of depravities and tortures on our inhabitants at the behest of our young, slim, fit, active, non-murderous Supreme Leader Kim Jong Whichever One It Is Now It Matters Not to Me They Are All Living Gods To Whom I Bend The Knee Always I Promise. Oh, hello North Korea. Remove that drily cynical tone from your voice or we will have you and your family sho \u2013 I mean, hello to you. It\u2019s not really \u201cinsinuating\u201d that the western world does, is it? It\u2019s more a \u201cgathering of facts from undercover journalists and testimony from the few defectors and escapees from the prison camps of an \u2013 and I choose this word with care \u2013 insanely brutal regime whose terrorising of citizens is almost matchless in the modern age.\u201d Tonight you die \u2013 I mean, what nonsense. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea laughs in your face at the complete illegitimacy of what you say. And notes the address of you, your parents and your children. The DPRK Association of Human Rights has just published a 50,000-word report insisting that its citizens \u201cenjoy genuine human rights\u201d \u2013 and thereby proving every bad word ever said about us is a lie. Including the assertions in the report issued earlier this year by the UN after it spent a year investigating North Korea and uncovered evidence of 120,000 people being raped, tortured and killed in the country\u2019s secret prison camps? What people? What prison camps? Our report, and I quote: \u201cLays bare the false and reactionary nature of the reckless anti-North Korean human rights racket.\u201d And who exactly are you quoting? The Korean Central News Agency. That\u2019s a state body, am I right? Yes! Who better to comment than an institution that already knows how brilliant we are! Google Earth can see your gulags. Gulags! Gulag, gulag, gulags. Isn\u2019t it a funny word?! Especially funny when you consider that they do not exist. Barack Obama owns Google Earth. It sees what he wants it to see. Do say: \u201cEverything about you is doubleplusungood.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cYou see, I think your problem is \u2013 you haven\u2019t gone far enough.\u201d",
