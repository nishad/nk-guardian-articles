    "content": "Those looking for an unusual gap year option may look no further \u2013 a new volunteer programme is looking for English-speakers to help North Korea\u2019s future tour guides improve their language skills and learn the basics of working with tourists. The programme, which offers a month-long teaching placement at Pyongyang Tourism College in the secretive country\u2019s capital city, is run by Juche Travel Services (JTS), a certified travel company which promises \u201cunparalleled levels of interaction and engagement with local Koreans.\u201d Volunteers will head up courses teaching English or tourism. The company says it is looking for people with a Tefl (teaching English as a foreign language) qualification or a background in tourism management, \u201cwho can contribute positively to growing the country\u2019s tourism industry\u201d. The scheme costs \u20ac1000 Euros (\u00a3765) for each volunteer which covers travel, accommodation and tourist excursions in the country. JTS says it is operating on a not-for-profit basis, with any excess funds to be spent on the tourism library at the college. The company says it is hoping to take up to five people on trips in May and November, but says it would consider alternative dates. Growing tourism sector Since 2009, western interest in travelling to North Korea has gathered momentum. An estimated 6,000 western tourists now visit every year through accredited tour companies, which includes US citizens, though their government \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d they do not travel there. Hundreds of thousands of tourists are estimated to come from neighbouring China each year. The ethics of travelling to North Korea are a subject of much debate. Some argue that greater interactions with the outside world is a positive development. Others have reservations about contributing financially to a regime accused of grave human rights abuses against its people, and travelling to a country where foreigners are escorted everywhere, and interactions with North Koreans are usually stage-managed with specially selected members of the public. Two of North Korea\u2019s biggest prestige projects in recent years have been the Masikryong ski resort and the \u2018tourist city\u2019 of Wonsan, and representatives promoting the country have begun to make themselves known on the world\u2019s travel forum circuit. \u201cThe country has made it clear that it is looking to grow its tourism sector in the coming years,\u201d said David Thompson from JTS. \u201cTo do so will require both international tourism expertise and foreign language skills.\u201d Thompson said volunteers will be subject to the same limitations as other tourists in terms of where they can go inside North Korea, and who they can speak to. \u201cTo my knowledge there will not be the opportunity to wander freely,\u201d he said. Teaching in North Korea 21 year-old British student Ben Griffin was the first to sign up for a test trial for the volunteer programme last year in conjunction with North Korea\u2019s National Tourism Authority. He had travelled to North Korea on an official tour the year before and \u201cjumped on the chance\u201d to go again, he says. Griffin was not allowed freedom of movement, though he insists he did not feel closely monitored, and his guides were flexible with his itinerary if he made a request. In an enthusiastic account of his trip for Juche Travel he describes being driven around in luxury cars and using clips of the classic television show Only Fools and Horses to aide his English lessons. My students were on an advanced level although I\u2019m sure that they felt Del boy\u2019s cockney slang was almost a different language in itself. He says the show was a big hit: \u201cMy students were on an advanced level although I\u2019m sure that they felt Del boy\u2019s cockney slang was almost a different language in itself. Even so comedy scenes such as Del boy\u2019s \u2018falling through the bar\u2019 or \u2018the chandelier repair\u2019 transcended any language barrier.\u201d A screening of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy also went down well, he said. Griffin said what struck him most about his students was the fact that they \u201cwere just real people,\u201d interested in his life and travels but also preoccupied by the same worries as students the world over: from relationships to weekend plans. Ethics of tourism \u201cWe are obviously of the opinion that tourism has a positive impact,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cBy building bridges and engaging with the country, you are helping to break down mistrust and preconceptions that have persisted for the past 60-odd years. That can only be a good thing.\u201d Choson Exchange, an organisation working inside North Korea to educate young professionals in business, economic policy and law, has long-advocated for meaningful interaction with the country, especially through industry. Something they believe is critical to driving change in the totalitarian state. Luxury tourist travel in a country with widespread problems with poverty and malnutrition can sit uncomfortably with some, but Griffin points out that this would be a difficult dilemma to address had he been a tourist in any developing country.",
