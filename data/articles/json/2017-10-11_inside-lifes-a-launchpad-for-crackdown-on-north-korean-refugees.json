Its rooms boast geranium-scented shower gel and stunning river views. \u201cReally nice,\u201d one satisfied guest wrote on Ctrip, China\u2019s top travel website. \u201cAnd also interesting to see all the business [people] from North Korea who are also staying there.\u201d The glowing reviews may not tell the whole story. This 20-floor riverside retreat is reportedly one of at least two hotels in the pretty Chinese border town of Dandong used by North Korean \u201cabduction teams\u201d tasked with hunting down defectors fleeing one of the world\u2019s most repressive regimes. \u201c[The agents] appear to be staying \u2026 for business but are instead collecting information on the locations of North Korean defectors and are launching operations to arrest them,\u201d a source told Daily NK, a Seoul-based website known for its intrigue-filled expos\u00e9s on the affairs of Kim Jong-un\u2019s reclusive state. Fleeing North Korea\u2019s oppression and deprivation has always been a high-stakes gamble for which failure can mean a trip to the gulag \u2013 or worse. This year the odds of success have lengthened, and not only because of the spies who have supposedly checked in to Life\u2019s. Activists say China has dramatically stepped up its campaign to catch North Korean fugitives. Since July, at least 41 have been detained on Chinese soil and returned to \u201ca place of torture and persecution\u201d, Human Rights Watch claimed last month. Some have been picked up in Changbai county, close to China\u2019s 880-mile border with North Korea. For runaways who make it across the Tumen river, which meanders between the two countries, Changbai is often the starting point of a punishing six-week odyssey to freedom in South Korea. Others have been caught thousands of miles to the south-west, along China\u2019s sparsely populated borders with Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. Sokeel Park, whose group, Liberty in North Korea, helps escapees, said some were being captured just as they prepared to cross out of China into the relative safety of south-east Asia. \u201cIt feels almost vindictive when they catch people there and send them back \u2026 They\u2019re nearly out and they are clearly refugees trying to get to South Korea. If you just let them cross into south-east Asia then it isn\u2019t going to be your problem any more.\u201d Human Rights Watch said this summer\u2019s detentions included 11 children, four elderly women and a baby born in custody. In the most disturbing case, one North Korean family of five reportedly killed themselves after being caught. China, North Korea\u2019s key ally and trading partner, dismissed what it called \u201cgroundless\u201d claims about its crackdown. \u201cNorth Koreans who enter China\u2019s territory illegally cannot be called refugees. They came to China via illegal means, violated Chinese laws and border regulations,\u201d said a foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, claiming China treated such people in accordance with domestic and international law and \u201chumanitarian principles\u201d. Ji Seong-ho, a Seoul-based defector who is campaigning against the detentions, said there was nothing humane or principled about China\u2019s actions. \u201cIt pains me to see these people who are looking for freedom being stopped along the way \u2026 For these people it is liberty or death,\u201d he said. While the rhetorical rumpus between the \u201cdotard\u201d US president and North Korea\u2019s \u201crocket man\u201d has dominated global headlines, Park said the world needed to refocus its attention on the human tragedy unfolding in the shadows. \u201cNorth Korea is not just this crazy guy with missiles. There are 24 million people involved. There is a very urgent need for a bit of a reality check here.\u201d More than 20,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea over the last decade, according to official statistics, most via what is called Asia\u2019s \u201cunderground railroad\u201d. This railroad \u2013 a hidden network of safehouses and smugglers, named after the system fugitives slaves used in 19th-century America \u2013 spirits defectors across China into south-east Asia and then, finally, on to Seoul where they can claim citizenship. Park said the number of annual arrivals had almost halved since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011, from up to 3,000 during the final five years of the reign of his father, Kim Jong-il, to less than 1,500. That number looks set to fall even further, with only 593 arrivals in the first six months of 2017. \u201cIt could be really low this year [and] I think the major factor is the security in China,\u201d said Park. Ji, who was born and raised in Hoeryong, a city near North Korea\u2019s border with China, knows well the hardships involved in a ride on the underground railroad. He fled across the Tumen in 2006 and began a 6,000-mile, three-month quest for freedom that took him through China, Myanmar and Laos and eventually on to Thailand, from where he flew to Seoul. \u201cIt\u2019s a very cruel game of life or death,\u201d said Ji, a double-amputee who used a crutch to heave himself on eight-hour treks through the jungle and remembers thinking: \u201cThis is how I\u2019m going to die.\u201d Ji has helped about 250 North Koreans make the same journey since becoming an activist and said the risks had increased dramatically since his escape, with China now trying to strangle smuggling networks. Do Hee-young, another Seoul-based activist, said Chinese police were carrying out raids thousands of miles from the North Korean border, targeting not just fugitives but also farmers and unskilled labourers who had lived in China for years. He claimed it was doing so at the behest of Kim Jong-un. \u201c[Kim] feels defectors are a threat to the regime because they are a sign that people are giving up on the country,\u201d he said. Park said he suspected Beijing \u2013 which has backed tightened UN sanctions against Kim\u2019s regime \u2013 was cracking down to avoid further riling its longtime ally. \u201cIf China wasn\u2019t arresting North Korean refugees and sending them back, I can see North Korea being even more upset \u2026 This is an extremely sensitive issue.\u201d Daily NK claimed agents from North Korea\u2019s state security ministry were using Life\u2019s business hotel as a base to launch operations. Last year a defector was snatched from a Ming-dynasty stretch of China\u2019s Great Wall, a short drive from Dandong\u2019s picturesque riverfront. \u201cThe local atmosphere is very tense,\u201d the source was quoted as saying. Staff at the three-star hotel rejected claims it counted North Korean spies among its guests as a fabrication. \u201cWe\u2019re just a normal hotel,\u201d said a sales manager who gave her name only as Ma. \u201cWe do take North Korean visitors, that\u2019s true, but they do normal business \u2026 We\u2019ve run the business for 10 years during which time there hasn\u2019t been a single abduction,\u201d she added. But the hotel would certainly provide good cover for Kim Jong-un\u2019s agents. Each morning its 9th-floor breakfast hall \u2013 which has sweeping views over the China\u2013North Korea Friendship Bridge and the North Korean city of Sinuiju \u2013 fills with North Korean guests. Many appear to be traders who chatter into smartphones and sport blue and red lapel pins featuring the portraits of North Korea\u2019s \u201ceternal president\u201d Kim Il-sung, and his son, the \u201cdear leader\u201d Kim Jong-il. The hotel\u2019s North Korean occupants are not ones for small talk. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand,\u201d one man, wearing immaculately polished shoes, black, flared trousers and the trademark Kim Il-sung badge, told the Guardian in broken Chinese when it tried to strike up conversation over coffee and kimchi. Outside the hotel\u2019s vanilla-scented lobby, a sign seemed to taunt the refugees who had been thwarted in their bid to outrun Kim\u2019s agents. \u201cNew hotel. New life,\u201d it said.
