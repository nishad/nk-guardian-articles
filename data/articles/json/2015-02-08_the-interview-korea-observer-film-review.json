    "content": "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a better plan \u2013 you\u2019re going to have to stick it up your ass.\u201d After the news stories, the cyber-attacks, the terror threats and the personal intervention of President Obama himself, here comes the movie at which North Korea reportedly took such offence. On the downside, it\u2019s not a subversive patch on Team America: World Police; if the ruling dynasty could withstand a puppet Kim Jong-il singing \u201cI\u2019m so ronery\u201d after feeding \u201cHans Brix\u201d to a killer shark, they can surely weather Randall Park\u2019s Kim Jong-un bursting into tears at a Katy Perry song and worrying about whether margaritas are gay. The plot sees vacuous TV host Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron (Seth Rogen) travelling to Pyongyang to interview the supreme leader, and (thanks to the CIA) \u201ctake him out\u201d while they\u2019re there. Things start well, with Eminem outing himself on Dave\u2019s dumbo US show (\u201cgay Twitter is blowing up\u201d), after which it\u2019s the usual relentless tide of dick, balls and butthole gags for which Rogen and co-director Evan Goldberg have become infamous. There\u2019s some This is the End-style mayhem, and just the teensiest bit of politics, but mainly, it\u2019s about men sticking things up their assholes. I laughed more than I expected, spurred on by the fact that in doing so I was exercising a basic democratic right. In these post-Charlie days, that seems more important than ever.",
