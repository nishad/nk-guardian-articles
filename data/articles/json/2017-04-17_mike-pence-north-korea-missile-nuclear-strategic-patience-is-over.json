    "content": "The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has warned North Korea not to test Donald Trump\u2019s resolve over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, adding that the US and its allies were running out of patience with the regime. Noting that Trump had recently ordered a missile strike against Syria, the vice-president, who is in Seoul at the start of a tour of Asia, said: \u201cNorth Korea would do well not to test his resolve.\u201d Pence, standing alongside South Korea\u2019s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, said Washington\u2019s commitment to its ally was \u201ciron-clad and immutable\u201d, and repeated that \u201call options are on the table\u201d \u2013 including military action \u2013 to forestall North Korea\u2019s quest to produce a nuclear weapon capable of striking the US mainland. Any use of nuclear weapons by Pyongyang, he added, would be met with \u201can overwhelming and effective response\u201d, a day after the regime conducted a failed missile launch. Earlier on Monday, during an unannounced visit to the heavily armed border separating North and South Korea, Pence said the \u201cera of strategic patience is over\u201d with North Korea and urged China to use its \u201cextraordinary levers\u201d to pressure the regime into abandoning its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.\u201d Pence said Trump was hopeful China would cooperate, adding: \u201cBut as the president has made very clear, either China will deal with this problem or the United States and our allies will.\u201d Pence arrived in South Korea amid claims that Sunday\u2019s missile test might have been thwarted by a cyber-attack by the US, and warnings from Trump\u2019s chief security adviser that tensions on the Korean peninsula were \u201ccoming to a head\u201d. Pence told US military personnel it was \u201chumbling\u201d to be at the demilitarised zone (DMZ), a two-mile-wide (4km) strip of land that has come to symbolise the standoff that has defined relations between the North and South since the Korean war ended in an uneasy truce in 1953. Two North Korean soldiers watched Pence from the northern side of the military demarcation line, one of them taking photographs of the vice-president. \u201cMy father served in the Korean war with the US army, and on the way here we actually saw some of the terrain my father fought on alongside Korean forces to help earn your freedom,\u201d Pence said in an address at Camp Bonifas. \u201cWe are grateful to all of those who each and every day stand in the gap for freedom here at the DMZ. It is a testament to the unshakeable bond between our people.\u201d Pence will offer similar reassurances to Japan \u2013 the US\u2019s other main ally in the region \u2013 when he visits Tokyo on Tuesday as part of a 10-day Asia-Pacific tour that also includes Indonesia and Australia. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman said that tensions needed to be eased on the Korean peninsula to resolve the situation. \u201cAs declared repeatedly, the current state of the Korean peninsula is highly complicated and highly dangerous,\u201d Lu Kang said in a briefing, responding to a question over North Korea\u2019s failed missile launch. \u201cThe point we have consistently made is that each country involved should refrain from behaviours that provoke one another and fuel their tension further and that they should make efforts to ease the tense situation on the Korean peninsula.\u201d The weekend passed with no sign that North Korea was about to conduct a nuclear test, with the country instead marking the anniversary of the birth of its founder, Kim Il-sung, with a huge military parade that included dozens of missiles, including one experts said could be a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Despite its failure, Sunday\u2019s missile launch was seen as a test of Trump\u2019s resolve after the president warned that he had not ruled out military action against North Korea and sent a US aircraft carrier battle group towards the peninsula. On Sunday, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, HR McMaster, appeared to confirm the view that the unprecedented show of naval force, which will take US ships to within several hundred kilometres of North Korea\u2019s nuclear test site, was intended to pressure China to do more to rein in its neighbour. McMaster indicated that Trump was not considering military action at this point, but would continue to work with China to peacefully resolve North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The consensus is \u201cthat this problem is coming to a head,\u201d McMaster told ABC\u2019s This Week programme. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully. \u201cWe are working together with our allies and partners and with the Chinese leadership to develop a range of options. \u201cThere is an international consensus now, including the Chinese leadership, that this is a situation that just cannot continue.\u201d McMaster added, however: \u201cThe president has made clear that he will not accept the United States and its allies and partners in the region being under threat from this hostile regime with nuclear weapons.\u201d North Korea watchers said they expected the regime to continue its ballistic missile programme, possibly including a test on an ICBM \u2013 a move that would dramatically increase pressure on Washington to act. Daniel Pinkston, an expert on North Korea at Troy University in Seoul, said Sunday\u2019s missile test was a \u201cstrong signal of defiance\u201d. \u201cNorth Korea has a long-term development plan and strategy to acquire reliable nuclear weapons and reliable delivery systems,\u201d Pinkston said. \u201cAcquiring such a capability requires testing. I have no reason to believe North Korea will cease testing until they have high confidence in the reliability of the nuclear warheads. And I have no reason to believe they will cease missile flight-tests. Missile development requires flight testing.\u201d Officials in Washington played down suggestions that Sunday\u2019s missile, which exploded seconds after it was launched, had been sabotaged by a US cyber-attack. Asked if he believed the US had used cyber-warfare to bring down the missile, the Republican senator John McCain, who chairs the Senate armed services committee, told NBC News: \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but I wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\u201d Earlier, the former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said cyber-attacks had worked in the past but he could not say if sabotage had been behind Sunday\u2019s failure. \u201cThere is a very strong belief that the US \u2013 through cyber-methods \u2013 has been successful on several occasions in interrupting these sorts of tests and making them fail,\u201d he said in an interview on BBC radio. A White House adviser travelling with Pence told reporters en route to Seoul that the US had good intelligence before and after the launch. Had the North conducted a nuclear test, \u201cother actions would have been taken\u201d, the adviser added, but did not offer details. Pence attended an Easter service with US military personnel soon after he arrived in Seoul on Sunday. \u201cLet me assure you that under President Trump\u2019s leadership our resolve has never been stronger, our commitment to this historic alliance with the courageous people of South Korea has never been stronger and with your help and God\u2019s help freedom will ever prevail on this peninsula,\u201d he told troops at the US Yongsan garrison. Referring to the North Korean missile launch, Pence added: \u201cThis morning\u2019s provocation from the North is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face every day in the defence of the freedom of the people of South Korea and the defence of America in this part of the world. \u201cYour willingness to step forward, to serve, to stand firm without fear, inspires the nation and inspires the world.\u201d Agencies in Seoul contributed to this report",
