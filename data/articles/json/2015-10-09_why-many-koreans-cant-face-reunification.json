    "content": "Twice a month a North Korean defector and a South Korean professor meet at a cafe in downtown Seoul for a caffeine-fuelled argument about one of the most perplexing political conundrums ever known. Over successive cups of coffee, Ko Young-hwan and Moon Chung-in consider ways to reconcile and reunite two of the most incompatible nations on earth. \u201cWe have very heated discussions,\u201d said Ko, a 62-year-old former diplomat and interpreter for Kim Il-sung, who defected in 1991 and is now part of a renewed push that South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, says will bring the reunification of the peninsula one step closer. Ko and Moon are members of Park\u2019s so-called presidential committee for unification preparation \u2013 a year-old initiative that officials in Seoul say should help pave the way for rejoining the two countries after 70 years of separation. \u201cIssues of reunification have been very divisive in South Korean society between left and right, between progressive and conservative. Perhaps no other issue has been as divisive as the issue of reunification,\u201d Chung Chong-Wook, the vice-chair of the 50-member committee, said at its headquarters near the presidential Blue House in Seoul. \u201cThe committee\u2019s mission is to try to forge national consensus among different groups.\u201d There are few thornier issues in global politics than reunification: the rejoining of one of the world\u2019s most dynamic and developed economies with one of its most dishevelled and repressive. On Saturday North Korea will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Korean Worker\u2019s Party, the backbone of the state. Satellite imagees have shown hundreds of trucks, armoured vehicles, troops and horses gathering for a massive military parade. There have also been rumours of a possible show of force on the peninsula in the form of a missile launch or even a fourth nuclear test. The cultural, political and above all economic gulf between North and South is now so great that many experts believe reunification is almost inconceivable. \u201cThere has never been a time when the officially declared goal \u2013 peaceful, gradual, negotiated and equally reciprocated unification \u2013 was even remotely possible. Never, ever \u2013 including now,\u201d said Andrei Lankov, an acclaimed Korea expert from Kookmin University in Seoul. Lankov listed a plethora of reasons \u2013 the gigantic cost, the social upheaval, the North Korean leadership\u2019s reluctance to surrender power \u2013 that explained why neither side genuinely wanted reunification, even if both still publicly espoused the idea. \u201cIt is a bit like Christians talking about the second coming. Theoretically they are committed \u2013 in practice it has little actual impact on their behaviour,\u201d he said of South Korea\u2019s feelings about the process. Nevertheless, President Park has placed unification at the forefront of her policy agenda, claiming it would be a bonanza for her nation. \u201cJust as the German people secured freedom, prosperity and peace by tearing down the Berlin Wall, we too must tear down barriers in our march towards a new future on the Korean peninsula,\u201d she said during a speech in Dresden last year, calling for \u201cmeticulous preparations\u201d to make that dream a reality. As part of Park\u2019s preparations \u2013 which some attribute to a genuine commitment to reunification and others dismiss as an attempt to boost political support at home \u2013 members of her committee\u2019s four working groups gather two or three times each month to discuss unification. The groups deal with issues relating to economics, law and politics, diplomacy and national security, and social and cultural policy. \u201cWe fundamentally agree with one another on the bigger picture,\u201d said Ko, an affable scholar from Seoul\u2019s Institute for National Security Strategy, who is part of the diplomacy and national security committee. \u201cBut we have our disagreements when it comes to technical issues.\u201d Moon, a liberal political scientist from Yonsei University, said he believed there could only be progress towards reunification if the US normalised relations with North Korea by recognising its government and reopening its embassy in Pyongyang. \u201cThe US has got to follow the Iranian deal model,\u201d he argued. \u201cDon\u2019t demonise North Korea. Obama didn\u2019t demonise Iran.\u201d Chung Chong-Wook, South Korea\u2019s former ambassador to China, said one key element was finding ways to improve relations sufficiently so that Seoul could begin pumping money into North Korea\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and industry. \u201cThe more we do before reunification actually arrives ... the less expensive the reunification will be.\u201d There is \u2013 officially, at least \u2013 one glaring absence from the presidential committee\u2019s discussions. South Korea\u2019s public insistence that unification can only come about in a peaceful, gradual way means any mention of the possible collapse of Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime is taboo. Chung admitted there were other government agencies examining the more \u201csinister\u201d scenarios that might lead to unification, but said his committee was not looking at such possibilities. Still, \u201cwhenever it [unification] comes we will have to take it\u201d. Many believe Pyongyang\u2019s political collapse, perhaps triggered by a rebellion or assassination, now represents the only real prospect for reunification. \u201cIf it is coming at all, it is coming the German way, but it is going to be much more violent, much more bloody, much more hectic than everything we have seen in Europe,\u201d said Lankov, who predicted that North Korea\u2019s elites would fight for their lives if faced with a popular uprising. \u201cI would say it will be a cross between the Syrian crisis and the East German crisis of 1989/90. If it doesn\u2019t sound good it is because it isn\u2019t good. It is going to be a very bloody mess\u201d he said, adding that both China and the US would be sucked in. Ko, the former diplomat, agreed. \u201cThe collapse of North Korea would be a real nightmare for us.\u201d His hopes for a unified peninsula lie in the gradual but important changes he said were taking place to the north of the 38th parallel, where there were hints of an economic opening up, and support for the \u201cDear Leader\u201d appeared to be waning. Ko, who worked under Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, claimed the current leader was \u201cstarting to lose the hearts and minds of the North Korean elites in the party, government and military\u201d. He said Kim Il-sung had been a charismatic leader who commanded genuine affection from the people, and Kim Jong-il knew how to effectively use the carrot-and-stick method. \u201cToday, Kim Jung-un is only using the stick.\u201d Ultimately, one of President Park\u2019s toughest challenges appears to be convincing South Korea\u2019s younger generations that unification is indeed a bonus rather than a potential calamity. Estimates of the cost of reunification range from $50bn (\u00a332bn) to more than $3tn. \u201cI think that nowadays the prevailing feeling is one of indifference,\u201d said Seongcheol Geum, a 23-year-old social welfare student at Yonsei University. \u201cFor today\u2019s generation, unification doesn\u2019t feel personal any more. It feels outdated.\u201d Sunny Song, 23, another Yonsei student, said: \u201cI think it is necessary in the long term, but in the short term I don\u2019t think it is possible and it shouldn\u2019t be done in the near future. The South Korean economy won\u2019t be able to support the North Korean economy.\u201d Chung Chong-Wook said his committee was determined to \u201ctransform the people\u2019s way of thinking on reunification\u201d and dispel the \u201crather negative attitude\u201d that had taken hold. \u201cUnification should be viewed as a bonanza rather than a burden,\u201d he said, claiming South Korea\u2019s economy would ultimately benefit rather than suffer. For Ko, who worked for North Korea\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs for more than a decade and defected when he was first secretary in Pyongyang\u2019s Congo embassy, the battle for reunification is deeply personal. Unification would finally allow him to return to the home he abandoned more than a quarter of a century ago. \u201cI miss [Pyongyang], but more than that I miss my family,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know when unification will come \u2013 it could be in one year or 10 years\u2019 time \u2013 but I believe I will go back there before I die.\u201d",
