    "content": "A top aide to Kim Jong-un is to due to travel to Washington on Friday to hand a letter from the North Korean leader to Donald Trump after senior officials claimed substantial progress had been made in preparing a summit between the two leaders. Kim Yong-chol, a 72-year-old former spy chief and vice-chairman of the ruling Workers\u2019 party, will travel to Washington from New York after two days of talks with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. \u201cWe made real progress in last 72 hours towards setting the conditions ... [for] putting President Trump and Kim Jong-un in a place where we think there can be real progress made by the two of them meeting,\u201d Pompeo said on Thursday. \u201cI am confident we are moving in the right direction. \u201cOur two countries face a pivotal moment in our relationship in which it would be nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste,\u201d he added. A trip to the US capital would require a special waiver enabling Kim Yong-chol to travel beyond a 25-mile radius of the United Nations headquarters in New York, as he is subject to US sanctions. The aim of the talks is to pave the way for a summit between Trump and the North Korean leader in Singapore scheduled for 12 June. The summit had been cast in doubt by an exchange of harsh rhetoric earlier in the month but both parties have engaged in a rapid series of meetings in a bid to salvage it. Trump conceded on Thursday it might take more than one summit to reach agreement on North Korean disarmament. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s all a process. We\u2019ll see. And hopefully we\u2019ll have a meeting on the 12th. That\u2019s going along very well, but I want it to be meaningful. It doesn\u2019t mean it gets all done at one meeting; maybe you have to have a second or a third. And maybe we\u2019ll have none.\u201d Asked what he wanted from a summit with Kim Jong-un, Trump told Reuters: \u201cI\u2019d like to see a total denuclearisation in as quick a period of time as is practicable.\u201d He added: \u201cYou\u2019re talking about machinery, you\u2019re talking about things that can\u2019t necessarily happen immediately but they can happen in as rapid a fashion as they can happen. That\u2019s what I want to happen.\u201d Trump told reporters he was looking forward to seeing what was in the letter from Kim Jong-un, saying it was \u201cvery important\u201d to the North Koreans. The insistence on delivering a letter to the White House in person follows the pattern of the only other high-level North Korean visit to Washington, when then vice-marshal Jo Myong-rok brought a note from Kim Jong-il, the current leader\u2019s father, to Bill Clinton in 2000. On that occasion, Jo changed from civilian clothes into a medal-bedecked uniform at the last minute before being photographed with Clinton, in what appeared to be a propaganda coup. Pompeo\u2019s talks with Kim Yong-chol on Thursday morning lasted about two and half hours, and took place in an empty high-rise apartment looking out on New York\u2019s East river, which is normally assigned to the US deputy permanent representative to the United Nations \u2013 a post that is currently unfilled. The two men ate a dinner of steak, pureed corn, celeriac and spinach together in the same unfurnished apartment on Wednesday. Thursday\u2019s two-hour meeting ended at 11.25am \u2013 well before the scheduled end at 1.30pm. Pompeo said the two men had enough time to cover all the major issues, but there was still \u201ca lot of work to do\u201d. \u201cThis is going to a process that will take days and weeks to work our way through,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be tough moments, there will be difficult times. I have had some difficult conversations with them as well. They\u2019ve given it right back to me too.\u201d While the New York negotiations were underway, simultaneous discussions between US and North Korean representatives were taking place in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) dividing the two Koreas and in Singapore, the planned venue for the summit. The Singapore talks are focused on logistics for the summit while the DMZ meetings are focused on the substance of a potential summit. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang on Thursday, and invited him to Moscow. At the meeting, Kim Jong-un expressed his commitment to the \u201cdenuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d, according to the official KCNA news agency. But his comments served as a reminder of the gulf which remains between US and North Korean interpretations of what \u201cdenuclearisation\u201d means in practice.",
