    "content": "After so many years of brandishing its guns, North Korea sent roses to the Winter Olympics. A cheer squad of 230 beauties in the bloom of youth, and Kim Jong-un\u2019s almost equally fresh-faced sister Kim Yo-jong, have mesmerised watchers in the host country South Korea and further afield. Their petite stature and beguiling smiles are in deliberate contrast to the North\u2019s usual macho bluster and missile tests. The two Koreas even entered the opening ceremony together and fielded a unified women\u2019s ice hockey team. It is a charm offensive by a country better known for the latter than the former. North Korea is a small and impoverished nation distinguished by its isolation, rapidly advancing nuclear programme, threats and invective, appalling human rights abuses and, yes, its oddity. And yet, it seems, this modest diplomatic effort has paid off. US disapproval was swiftly overshadowed: \u201cKim Jong-un\u2019s sister is stealing the show at the Winter Olympics,\u201d trilled CNN. \u201cOlympics open door to reunification,\u201d claimed another headline. \u201cAn Olympic miracle: is Korean reunification in the cards?\u201d asked a third excitedly. A member of the IOC suggested that the joint women\u2019s ice hockey team should be nominated for the Nobel peace prize. This is not so much premature as absurd. Pyongyang has no intention of giving up its nuclear programme, as Washington demands. Although it has in the past committed itself to peaceful reunification, no one believes it is willing to change in the way that it would be needed. The real issue is that the doomsday clock is ticking closer to midnight since the election of Donald Trump \u2013 and any attempt to halt the hands is welcome. The North is increasingly close to developing a nuclear-tipped ICBM that can hit the continental US. Washington knows it cannot destroy all the country\u2019s capabilities \u2013 so hawks are now arguing for a \u201cbloody nose\u201d strategy to warn Kim Jong-un off threatening the US (though he must know any attack would be suicidal). Seoul, just 35 miles from the border, would bear the brunt of any retaliation. A conflict could kill tens of thousands and potentially draw in other regional powers, including China. \u201cThere\u2019s a real concern that for the first time there is a US administration that could take unilateral action against North Korea without consulting the South,\u201d says Professor Hazel Smith of the centre of Korean studies at Soas Univeristy of London. \u201cPeople are pushing, virtually preparing, for a so-called \u2018surgical strike\u2019 \u2013 even though the majority of US and South Korean military planners argue that it would be risky to the point of likely catastrophe for the South, and US troops there. \u201cThe Olympic initiative was never going to solve the nuclear question overnight, but I think it has stopped the mad escalation of the conflict that was going on.\u201d The task of Kim Yo-jong and the bevy of cheerleaders has been to normalise the image of a country that looks utterly abnormal to outsiders. The North is expert in spectacles, such as its immense military parades and the 100,000-strong synchronised displays at its Mass Games. It is equally adept at symbolism: Kim\u2019s grandfather Kim Il-sung remains eternal president, more than two decades after his death. Even its missile tests, although necessary to develop its programme, are frequently timed for maximum effect. Its overall message \u2013 to its own people, and the outside world \u2013 is one of defiant, unassailable might in the face of US aggression. But others perpetuate the cartoonish image of the North. US hawks hold up its sabre-rattling rhetoric as evidence of the danger posed by a bellicose and irrational regime. Tourists seek entertainment in the \u201cStalinist Disneyland\u201d of Pyongyang. And with the Olympics, the IOC burnishes its flimsy credentials as a bearer of international goodwill. Such caricatures further disguise this deliberately opaque country, making it harder than ever to see the reality. It controls information so successfully both inside and out (cheerleaders at previous international fixtures were reportedly sent to prison camps for discussing what they had seen abroad) that North Korea-watchers \u201care all walking in the dark and know that the chances we are right on any given issue are nearly random,\u201d writes Stephan Haggard, one of the leading experts on the country\u2019s political economy. The former CIA analyst Bruce Klingner, now with the Heritage Foundation, has compared trying to understand the North with working on a jigsaw \u201cwhen you have a mere handful of pieces and your opponent is purposely throwing pieces from other puzzles into the box\u201d. The North\u2019s siege mentality dates back to its creation. Korea\u2019s division along the 38th parallel at the end of the second world war was meant to be temporary, but rival governments in the North (occupied by Soviet forces) and the South (occupied by the Allies) both laid claim to the whole peninsula. In 1950, the North invaded; the devastating war was halted by an armistice three years later \u2013 but never a peace deal. Technically, then, the war has not ended, and the North has structured its society accordingly. Having been flattened by US bombs, it is genuinely frightened of future threats \u2013 but US aggression is also a convenient excuse for the poverty of a country that once prospered. The collapse of its patron, the Soviet Union, was the final straw for a struggling economy: a famine in the 90s killed hundreds of thousands. \u201cNorth Korea is not an undeveloped country; it is a country that has fallen out of the developed world,\u201d Barbara Demick wrote in Nothing to Envy, her book on those desperate years. The disintegration of the state economy left the North with the worst of all worlds. It is a totalitarian state with tens of thousands of political prisoners, accused by the UN of atrocities unparalleled in the modern world. It polices even people\u2019s haircuts and what they watch at home. Yet it has abandoned attempts to provide for them. Most household income is from the private sector; wages from official jobs are so poor that some pay bribes not to show up. Meanwhile, the infiltration of foreign media and the experiences of North Koreans working abroad \u2013 often illicitly \u2013 have allowed people to understand that there is another way of life. The result is increasing disaffection and cynicism. The state cannot support or enable, only hinder. Meanwhile, groups and networks in the elite compete for economic interests. Some thought Kim \u2013 young and inexperienced \u2013 could not last long, that he would be unable to handle the growing contradictions, or clashing ambitions and interests in the elite, or to deal with diplomacy. Some even wondered if the regime could stand (a revolution is not utterly impossible but highly unlikely, says Professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul: \u201cThe people are disunited and terrified. The elite are united and understand they have no exit option.\u201d) Although the North is heavily dependent on China, their relations \u2013 always marked by mutual suspicion \u2013 have deteriorated dramatically on his watch. Jung Pak, of the Brookings Institution think tank, points out that since becoming leader his significant contacts with foreigners have been limited to precisely two people: Dennis Rodman, the ex-basketball star; and the Japanese sushi chef who worked for his father. Yet Kim has cemented his position, in part through tighter control. He purged and executed his uncle Jang Song-thaek; and he is believed to have ordered the killing of his self-exiled brother, Kim Jong-nam, a year ago. There have been repeated crackdowns on smuggled \u2013 especially South Korean \u2013 media. On the other hand he has promised his people a return to prosperity, and though this has mostly been signalled by totemic projects such as a ski resort, there have been some broader economic shifts, such as an increase in marketisation, apparently producing modest improvements in the economy. And, in dispatching the Olympic delegation, and then inviting the South Korean president Moon Jae-in to visit him, he has shown he can reduce tensions as well as increase them. Sending his sister was doubly inspired. A family member is a more intimate representative than a high-ranking official. And for a patriarchal culture, Kim Yo-jong and the cheerleaders are \u2013 by virtue of gender \u2013 not only charming and unthreatening but somehow morally elevated, detached from worldly, manly concerns of power (never mind that, in reality, Kim is at the heart of her brother\u2019s regime). Yet Southern descriptions of this \u201carmy of beauties\u201d point up the ambivalence: their perfect synchronisation and pasted-on grins simultaneously reinforce stereotypes of the North as a nation of obedient, brainwashed automatons. For every South Korean expressing pleasant surprise at Kim Yo-jong\u2019s smile, there is another \u2013 and not just in conservative ranks \u2013 complaining of a Northern PR bonanza at the South\u2019s expense. Seoul\u2019s unification ministry this week acknowledged \u201csignificant criticism and concerns\u201d. The aim for Pyongyang is clear: to avoid a US attack, but also to rid itself of the sanctions threatening its economy. But in the South, the failure of previous efforts to improve relations (notably the \u201cSunshine Policy\u201d, which handed over wodges of cash to the North) has created a certain wariness about fresh endeavours, and a sense of the North as dangerous, untrustworthy and ungrateful \u2013 as well as very, very different. South Korea\u2019s constitution commits it to the pursuit of peaceful reunification. Yet support is shrinking fast. One recent survey found that more than 60% of people in their 50s and 60s wished for unification \u2013 compared with just 14% of those in their 20s. Some of the older generation still have family members on the other side of the divide and memories of a shared culture. When Korea split, the two halves were both impoverished dictatorships. But the South is now a democracy, with an economy between 15 and 40 times the size of the North\u2019s. It leads Asian pop culture. Even the language has diverged. To many young people in the South, the North looks like a freakish, unrecognisable dystopia. \u201cReunification was part of traditional Korean ethnic nationalism, which is very strong. But it\u2019s already dying. They have different cultures, different economies, zero communication. How can you expect a sense of common destiny \u2013 this basis of nationalism \u2013 to survive?\u201d asks Lankov. The truth is that the Olympic rapprochement owes little to grand dreams of reconciliation, and far more to immediate, prosaic imperatives. The first was simply a trouble-free Games \u2013 not just a question of prestige; Pyongyang blew up an airliner, killing 115 people, in a failed attempt to derail the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The second is preventing a US military strike. South Koreans are notable for their sanguine approach to the nuclear crises that rattle the peninsula. When TVs around the world blare out warnings of the latest North Korean provocation, they get on with their lives. \u201cI think the average South Korean has no clue how likely a military confrontation in or around North Korea has been since the rise of Mr Trump. Everybody was crying wolf before; people don\u2019t understand the wolf might really be coming this time. But the elite are very aware of how dangerous it is \u2013 nearly panicking,\u201d says Lankov. \u201cMoon is in an incredibly challenging situation,\u201d notes Scott Snyder, senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. He must try to warm relations with the North, and open up a space for dialogue between the North and US on the nuclear issue \u2013 while the North will be pressing in the other direction. He faces potential trigger points, such as the resumption of the annual joint US-South Korean military drills, delayed until the Paralympics has ended. So far Moon has trodden carefully. Despite his reputation as a dove and the way that Trump has repeatedly undermined relations between Washington and Seoul, such as by attacking the bilateral free trade deal, he has no intention of offering the North something for nothing. Last month he thanked the US president for helping to bring the North to the talks that led to the Olympic agreement. His response to the North\u2019s invitation to a summit was cautious: \u201cLet\u2019s create the environment for that to be able to happen.\u201d US and South Korean top level officials are coordinating on a daily basis to dispel any hopes Pyongyang may have of driving a wedge into the 70-year alliance. But the conflicting signals coming from various members of the administration make his task even harder. In this tense situation, it would be ludicrous to present a Mexican wave and dance routines as the key to preventing a conflagration on the Korean peninsula. Yet it would be wrong to suggest that such exchanges are utterly irrelevant: \u201cThe exaggerated depiction of \u2018otherness\u2019 may contribute to dehumanising the country, making it easier to contemplate its total destruction, to paraphrase President Trump,\u201d the North Korea expert Marcus Noland wrote recently. Is the North\u2019s participation in Pyeongchang a first step to denuclearisation and eventual reunification? No. Events in Iraq and Libya hardened the regime\u2019s beliefs that hanging on to WMDs is a matter of survival. The thaw may not even be a precursor to substantive reengagement with the South, or broader talks, let alone a breakthrough (although the North might freeze its programme if offered a cast-iron US security guarantee, it is hard to see that happening under Trump). But if the softening of the North\u2019s image and approach make it harder for US hawks to strike, then Seoul \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 should be grateful for those synchronised chants and armwaves.",
