    "content": "North Korea has defied threats of \u201cfire and fury\u201d from Donald Trump, deriding his warning as a \u201cload of nonsense\u201d and announcing a detailed plan to launch missiles aimed at the waters off the coast of the US Pacific territory of Guam. A statement attributed to General Kim Rak Gyom, the head of the country\u2019s strategic forces, declared: \u201cSound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him\u201d. The general outlined a plan to carry out a demonstration launch of four intermediate-range missiles that would fly over Japan and then land in the sea around Guam, \u201cenveloping\u201d the island. \u201cThe Hwasong-12 rockets to be launched by the KPA [Korean People\u2019s Army] will cross the sky above Shimani, Hiroshima and Koichi prefectures of Japan,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThey will fly for 3,356.7 km for 1,065 seconds and hit the waters 30 to 40km away from Guam.\u201d The statement said the plan for this show of force would be ready by the middle of this month and then await orders from the commander-in-chief, Kim Jong-un. The statement was clearly designed as a show of bravado, calling the Trump administration\u2019s bluff after the president\u2019s threat and a statement from the defence secretary, James Mattis, both stressing the overwhelming power of the US military. \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met by fire and fury like the world has never seen,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday. The response from Pyongyang was its most public and detailed threat to date, and evidently meant to goad the US president. Trump had \u201clet out a load of nonsense about \u2018fire and fury\u2019 failing to grasp the ongoing grave situation. This is extremely getting on the nerves of the infuriated Hwasong artillerymen of the KPA.\u201d The US has a naval base in Guam and the island is home to Andersen air base, which has six B-1B heavy bombers. According to NBC news the non-nuclear bombers have made 11 practice sorties since May in readiness for a potential strike on North Korea. The remote island is home to 162,000 people. South Korea\u2019s military said on Thursday that North Korea\u2019s statements were a challenge against Seoul and the US-South Korea alliance. Joint chiefs of staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon told a media briefing that South Korea was prepared to act immediately against any North Korean provocation. Japan\u2019s chief government spokesman said the country could \u201cnever tolerate this\u201d. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s actions are obviously provocative to the region as well as to the security of the international community,\u201d Yoshihide Suga said. The announcement on the North Korean state news service KCNA came at the end of two days of brinksmanship which began with the leak of a US intelligence report that Pyongyang had developed a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile. This was followed by Trump\u2019s warning of \u201cfire and fury\u201d. On Wednesday the US defence secretary, James Mattis, said a North Korean attack would risk the \u201cend of its regime and the destruction of its people\u201d. On Thursday, Trump\u2019s deputy assistant, Sebastian Gorka, declined to tone down the rhetoric, warning Pyongyang: \u201cDo not challenge the United States because you will pay a cost if you do so\u201d Asked if the threat of a strike, rather than an actual attack, would be enough to provoke a response, Gorka told the BBC: \u201cIf you threaten a nation, then what should you expect; a stiffly worded letter to be sent by courier? Is that what the UK would do if a nation threatened a nuclear-tipped missile launched against any of the UK\u2019s territories?\u201d Damian Green, the UK\u2019s first secretary of state, urged the Trump administration to use UN processes to resolve the crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously in all our interests to make sure that nothing escalates,\u201d Green said on a visit to Edinburgh. \u201cWe are very strongly in support of the UN process, which has and continues to put pressure on North Korea to stop acting in an irresponsible way.\u201d In the event of a missile launch by North Korea, the US military faces the dilemma of trying to intercept the incoming missiles and risking humiliation if it fails. Trump would have to decide whether to try to carry out a pre-emptive strike on the Hwasong launchpads or a retaliation strike if the launch went ahead. The North Korean military has frequently tested missiles that land in the sea off the Japanese coast, without a military response from Tokyo. \u201cFor the [North Koreans] to telegraph a move like this is extraordinary. But it\u2019s probably their way of trying not to trigger a war,\u201d said Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. He said that if the launch went ahead as laid out in the statement, it gave US the opportunity to concentrate its ballistic defences in that area, to give them a better chance to shoot down the incoming missiles. \u201cThe reason you can\u2019t shoot down a test is that it doesn\u2019t enter a defended area. But that wouldn\u2019t be the case with \u2018bracketing fire\u2019,\u201d Pollack said in a thread of tweets. He argued that the exchange of threats and the missile plans underlined the need to open a military hotline between the US and North Korea to mitigate the dangers of catastrophic miscalculation by either side. \u201cIf they do carry out that plan, both sides might discover that they need a crisis management mechanism sooner than not,\u201d Pollack said. Mattis\u2019s reminder to Pyongyang that the allied militaries \u201cpossess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth\u201d capped an unprecedented 24 hours of sabre-rattling sparked by Donald Trump\u2019s surprise threat to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d down on the Pyongyang regime. Despite the harsh rhetoric, there was no change in US military deployments or alert status. Mattis couched his remarks in the language of traditional deterrence, making clear that such overwhelming force would be used in the event of a North Korean attack. Trump \u2013 without consulting his own security staff \u2013 had warned of a devastating onslaught \u201clike the world has never seen\u201d if Kim\u2019s government persisted in threats against the US. But that line was crossed within hours when Pyongyang announced it was \u201ccarefully examining\u201d a plan for a missile strike and \u201cenveloping fire\u201d around Guam. The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, also spent much of Wednesday struggling to contain the fallout from Trump\u2019s threats, assuring Americans they could \u201csleep well at night\u201d, and reassuring shocked allies that there was \u201cno imminent threat of war\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 August 2017 to correct a statement from Joshua Pollack.",
