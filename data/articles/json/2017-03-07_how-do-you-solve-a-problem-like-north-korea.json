    "content": "The chronic failure of diplomacy to resolve the long-running North Korea problem, dramatised by Tuesday\u2019s tit-for-tat \u201chostage taking\u201d by Malaysia and Kim Jong-un\u2019s outlawed regime, is accelerating the militarisation of a conflict that threatens to suck in the US, China and other east Asian countries. North Korea\u2019s decision to prevent Malaysian diplomats and citizens leaving the country was condemned by Najib Razak, Malaysia\u2019s prime minister. \u201cThis abhorrent act, effectively holding our citizens hostage, is in total disregard of all international law and diplomatic norms,\u201d he said. Najib announced a retaliatory travel ban on North Korean nationals in Malaysia and warned Pyongyang against further escalation. But the row, sparked by the assassination in Kuala Lumpur of Kim\u2019s half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, allegedly by North Korean agents, is emblematic of a bigger problem. Since 2000, when Madeleine Albright, then US secretary of state, visited North Korea at Bill Clinton\u2019s behest, Britain and other western countries have worked on the assumption that a mix of quiet diplomacy, limited sanctions, containment and incentives would eventually bring North Korea into line. But that comfortable assumption has proved false, especially after Kim Jong-il died in 2011 and was replaced by his unpredictable, paranoid son, Kim Jong-un. Kim has aggressively expanded North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programmes in defiance of the UN and global opinion. The international community\u2019s impotent rage this week over Kim\u2019s provocative launch of four missiles into the Sea of Japan underlined diplomacy\u2019s bankruptcy. Barack Obama told Donald Trump before he left office that North Korea was probably the gravest security risk he would face as president. The normally voluble Trump has remained largely silent on the subject. But the US is increasingly leaning on military solutions. US Pacific Command announced on Tuesday that missile launchers and other equipment for the Thaad (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence) missile system had arrived in South Korea. The US says Thaad is purely a defensive measure, but both China and Russia object, arguing that it upsets the regional strategic balance. China has penalised South Korea for hosting Thaad. The authorities have closed dozens of South Korean-owned retail outlets and Chinese tourism to South Korea may be curtailed. Beijing has also been irked by US criticism of its refusal to take tougher action against North Korea. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the US, South Korea and Japan, which is also deploying new missile capabilities, were exacerbating the danger of conflict. \u201cThe consequences of this are on the shoulders of the United States and South Korea. [They] should not keep going down the wrong path,\u201d Geng said. \u201cWe will definitely be taking necessary measures to safeguard our own security interest.\u201d North Korea cited this month\u2019s large-scale, joint US-South Korean military exercises as evidence that a \u201chostile\u201d Washington was planning to invade. Kim this week ordered the Korean People\u2019s Army Strategic Force \u201cto keep highly alert as required by the grim situation in which an actual war may break out any time\u201d, the state news agency reported. While offensive US action is considered unlikely, Kim will certainly have noted Trump\u2019s vow to increase US military spending by $50bn and his emphasis on bigger, better ships and nuclear weapons. Trump\u2019s military buildup comes in the context of a regional arms race, with China and Japan, historical antagonists, both increasing military spending. The \u201chostage\u201d crisis may also suck in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Malaysia is a leading member. While attacking Kim for his \u201cblind\u201d pursuit of nuclear weapons, China\u2019s state-run Global Times warned on Tuesday that the prospect of war on the Korean peninsula was growing: \u201cIf the parties dismiss China\u2019s advice and refuse to make efforts to reduce tensions, they can only blame themselves for the huge losses they will suffer in the end.\u201d",
