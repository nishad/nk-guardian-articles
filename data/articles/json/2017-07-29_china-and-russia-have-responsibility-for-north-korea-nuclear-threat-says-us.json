    "content": "The United States has accused China and Russia of bearing \u201cunique and special responsibility\u201d for North Korea\u2019s \u201cbelligerent\u201d pursuit of nuclear weapons, after Pyongyang tested its latest ballistic missile. North Korea conducted its second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test late on Friday in what it called a warning to the \u201cbeast-like US imperialists\u201d. It came less than a month after its first such experiment, on 4 July. The test-launch sent \u201ca grave warning to the US\u201d that it \u201cwould not go scot-free if it dares provoke\u201d the North, Pyongyang\u2019s official news agency, KCNA, said in a statement. \u201cIf the Yankees brandish the nuclear stick on this land again despite our repeated warnings, we will clearly teach them manners,\u201d KCNA warned. The news agency described Pyongyang\u2019s weapons programs as a \u201cprecious strategic asset that cannot be bartered for anything\u201d and an indication of the country\u2019s \u201ctremendous might\u201d. The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, hit back on Saturday, describing North Korea\u2019s launch as a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of multiple UN security council resolutions. Tillerson also pointed the finger of blame at Beijing and Moscow. \u201cAs the principal economic enablers of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development program, China and Russia bear unique and special responsibility for this growing threat to regional and global stability,\u201d he said in a statement. Tillerson\u2019s comments are sure to anger Russia and China. Earlier this month Beijing rejected claims from US president Donald Trump that it had a responsibility to do more to rein in its ally. \u201cI think this either shows lack of a full, correct knowledge of the issue, or there are ulterior motives for it, trying to shift responsibility,\u201d Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters. On Saturday, China\u2019s foreign ministry made no reference to Tillerson\u2019s comments but called on Pyongyang \u201cto respect United Nations security council resolutions and stop all acts that could worsen tensions on the Korean peninsula\u201d. China also \u201curged all the relevant parties to act with caution\u201d to prevent the situation from escalating, the ministry added, parroting previous language on the issue. Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) thinktank in Washington, said Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest test \u2013 of a missile some experts said had the capacity to reach New York \u2013 would increase Chinese fears of a US strike against the North. \u201cI suspect that the Chinese are going to be worried about the possibility of a US military strike on North Korea going forward \u2026 The Chinese can\u2019t rule out the Trump \u2018unpredictability\u2019 factor,\u201d she said. Last week the US\u2019s top military officer told a security forum in Aspen, Colorado that conflict with North Korea was not \u201cunimaginable\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s unimaginable to me is allowing a capability that would allow a nuclear weapon to land in Denver, Colorado \u2013 that\u2019s unimaginable to me. And so my job will be to develop military options to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Gen Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Glaser said it was hard to predict whether Trump\u2019s White House was genuinely pondering such military options, which might include attempting to destroy a North Korean missile on the launch pad before it it was fired. But following Friday\u2019s test, calls for a return to negotiations appeared increasingly unrealistic. \u201cDiplomacy seems very unlikely at present.\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea specialist at the Middlebury institute of international studies, said he believed a military strike against North Korea had become unthinkable in the light of the ICBM tests, which showed Pyongyang could hit targets on US soil by launching missiles from unexpected locations and at unexpected times. \u201cThe North Koreans wanted to demonstrate that ... if there was a war they could definitely launch [missiles] in the dead of night from some place we don\u2019t expect so we wouldn\u2019t have a chance to fire at them before they got off the ground.\u201d \u201cWhat I think this changes is that it forces the US to confront something that we have said for a long-time is unacceptable \u2026 [that] they can target New York and LA and there is not much we can do about it.\u201d \u201cThe window for [military action] has closed. People are jumping up and down and screaming [in Washington] not because they are getting ready to attack but because they don\u2019t really have that option any more and they accept that it has gone,\u201d Lewis added. \u201cAttacking a nuclear-armed state is usually a bad idea - which is why countries build nuclear weapons. That is kind of the appeal.\u201d",
