    "content": "Three snowboarders are set to be the first western professionals to visit North Korea\u2019s Masikryong ski resort, as part of a tour to the facility in January. Three of snowboarding\u2019s leading names \u2013 Terje H\u00e5konsen, Dan \u201cDanimals\u201d Liedahl and Mike Ravelson \u2013 will visit the recently completed resort alongside a group of other tourists as part of a trip organised in conjunction with Snowboarder Magazine. \u201cThe riders are really excited about it. These guys have a sense of adventure and they\u2019re always down to go to far flung locales so they were eager to ride Masik Pass,\u201d Tom Monterosso, the magazine\u2019s editor, said in a press release. Running from 9-16 January and costing $2,400, the trip includes a helicopter flight to Masikryong from Pyongyang and a chance to ride alongside \u201cthe best snowboarders who have ever lived\u201d, according to a statement by Uri Tours, the company organising the trip. The company\u2019s CEO, Andrea Lee, said: \u201cWe have found that sports is an effective avenue for engagement and interaction between foreign travellers and local people, particularly where language can be a barrier.\u201d Sport focus Leader Kim Jong-un has made it clear he wants to put the DPRK at the centre of the international sporting stage, with the January tour just one of a number initiatives aimed at promoting the DPRK\u2019s facilities. This year saw the completion of an ambitious restoration of Pyongyang\u2019s flagship May Day stadium, apparently as part of the regime\u2019s wish to host both the football World Cup and the Olympic Games in future. In addition, a variety of new venues have appeared across the country, including roller-skating facilities, a horse-riding centre, a surf centre near the eastern city of Hamhung and a brand new football academy, built with an $800,000 grant from Fifa\u2019s development programme. Revenue The Masikryong resort is one of the larger scale construction projects built at the behest of DPRK leader in recent years, thought to have cost an estimated $30m to build. Charging $50 per person entry, the People\u2019s Committee in Kangwon Province and DPRK Ministry of Sports reportedly anticipate a net revenue of $62.5m from the ski resort per year, of which $43.75m will be profit. \u201cNorth Korea is trying to cover their revenue through those kinds of tours and events. In the past, they got a lot of money by running the [Mount] Kumgang tours,\u201d says Shin Yong-seok, a researcher at the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute. But Shin is sceptical the resort will reach its targets. \u201cI think Masikryong is not an attractive ski resort because for Chinese visitors, skiing is not a familiar sport. And for the Americans and Europeans, [though] they are more familiar with skiing they have domestic resorts. So, it seems it has not paid for itself until now.\u201d A Uri Tours press release also mentions the construction of new facilities at Masikryong. \u201cThe total area of the resort is 1412 hectares, with 10 runs, 4 chairlifts and a new gondola installed this year,\u201d the statement reads.
