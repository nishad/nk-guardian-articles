    "content": "The US\u2019s large Korean population tends not to agree on much. But when it comes to Donald Trump\u2019s approach to North Korea, the community \u2013 whether Republican or Democratic, religious or secular, part of a thriving small business community or a younger generation of more progressive political activists \u2013 is both unified and scared half out of its wits. \u201cThe consensus,\u201d said Joon Bang, executive director of the non-partisan Korean American Coalition in Los Angeles, \u201cis that we find Donald Trump to be a greater threat than Kim Jong-un because he is creating more chaos and uncertainty. That\u2019s shocking, right? It\u2019s never happened before.\u201d Ever since the president started threatening Kim\u2019s regime with \u201cfire and fury\u201d over the summer, leaders of the 1.8-million-strong Korean American community have been begging him to ratchet back the incendiary rhetoric, to no avail. Already in August, a group of more than 20 elected Korean American officials wrote a letter to the White House urging Trump not to introduce the threat of nuclear weapons. \u201cAs Korean Americans, we have clear and deep memories of the last time military conflict arose on the Korean peninsula,\u201d they wrote. \u201cMillions of Korean families live with collective memories of both the American and Korean bloodshed and the unending yearning for those loved ones who were lost or separated during the three-year war.\u201d The dismay has only deepened since, as Trump has mocked Kim as \u201cRocket Man\u201d or even \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d; threatened, in his inaugural speech at the United Nations, to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea; and tweeted that \u201conly one thing will work\u201d to resolve the crisis over North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear weapons capabilities. \u201cThis is not normal,\u201d the councilman David Ryu of Los Angeles, one of the signatories of the August letter, told the Guardian. \u201cFor the life of me, I don\u2019t know if he understands what he means by \u2018total destruction\u2019. That means millions of people dying on both sides. Is that something that he wants on his conscience?\u201d When Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, sought to calm the jangling nerves of US allies by indicating last month that he was opening a line of communication to Pyongyang, Trump said he was \u201cwasting his time\u201d. Now, Trump is planning a stop in South Korea on his five-nation Asian tour which begins later this week, but will not make the customary trip to the demilitarized zone separating the north and south \u2013 apparently in deference to South Korean fears that he could inflame tensions further. Many Korean Americans interviewed for this piece said the Trump administration was badly misreading the North\u2019s intentions with its most recent rounds of missile testing \u2013 acts that they said were in line with the North\u2019s long-established behavior as a wayward geopolitical child and needed to be met with a grownup response. \u201cThe missile tests are worrisome, but you have to remember we have had incidents and accidents every three or four years,\u201d said Edward Park, a professor of Asian and Asian American studies at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. \u201cEven under the best circumstances, these incidents have the potential to thrust the peninsula into crisis. Now, with all these tensions ratcheted up, we\u2019ve just lost any margin of error.\u201d Ryu, the Los Angeles councilman, is particularly attuned to the disparate voices in the Korean community because his city boasts the largest single concentration of Koreans outside of the Korean peninsula. Although a Democrat, he holds a non-partisan office and owes his election to a broad spectrum of voters and interest groups. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid this escalation of words could get to a point where there\u2019s no turning back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could box the North Korean dictator in to point where there\u2019s a showdown. It\u2019s not in anybody\u2019s interest, whether it\u2019s Americans or Koreans or Japan or China, to have a war and especially a nuclear war. \u201cWe are unified in our concern, in our fear \u2013 and it\u2019s starting to boil down to anger as well.\u201d The sentiments are little different among registered Republicans. \u201cIs \u2018Rocket Man\u2019 an insult or a joke?\u201d asked Alex Kim, of the Korean American Republican Council. \u201cWhen you are dealing with another culture, you can\u2019t assume they would see the humor in that \u2026 He [Trump] should rely more on the people he can delegate to instead of responding directly to another country.\u201d Part of the outrage stems from the fact that many Korean Americans remain in close touch with friends and family members back on the peninsula, which has lived with the threat of North Korean aggression for more than 60 years. So rather than sharing the Trump administration\u2019s alarm that an intercontinental ballistic missile might soon be able to reach the continental United States, they tend to feel aggrieved that the US government has only just woken up to their reality. Many Korean Americans find themselves questioning the solidity of the long-standing US commitment to protect the peninsula now that the White House is preaching an \u201cAmerica first\u201d mantra and poking holes in the security arrangements that have underpinned relations between the United States and much of east Asia since the second world war. \u201cThere is a fundamental crack in the faith that Americans will treat the lives and fortunes of these countries as we would treat our own,\u201d Park, the Asia specialist, said. \u201cWhen the president of the world\u2019s only remaining superpower \u2026 washes his hands of the responsibility of the security alliances of Nato and our bilateral security alliances with South Korea and Japan, that\u2019s a cause for huge worry.\u201d They also fear that the only solution to a United States in retreat on the world stage is a more nuclearized region \u2013 with Japan and South Korea acquiring their own weapons over time to counter the threat from Pyongyang. The letter sent in August reflects another concern: that the Korean American community does not have enough of a voice in Washington to talk Trump down from the ledge. No Korean American currently serves in Congress, and while Trump has signaled his intention to appoint an experienced Korean American national security hand, Victor Cha, as the next ambassador to Seoul, he has yet to send Cha\u2019s nomination to the Senate for confirmation. Since January, the state department has also lost many of its top-level Asian affairs specialists, with little sign that they will be replaced. \u201cMany Korean Americans want to appeal directly to the president to remind him of some basic things \u2013 that there are real human beings living in South Korea and that North Koreans are human beings too,\u201d Park said. \u201cNo one in the community could credibly argue that turning the Korean peninsula into a sea of fire is a good idea. \u201cThere is no winner in a nuclear war \u2013 this is not reality TV. For Koreans, this is just an unimaginable recklessness that needs to stop.\u201d",
