    "content": "On 13 September, North Korea will join the ranks of the world\u2019s surfing destinations when 20 tourists (mostly advanced surfers from the US, plus people from Italy and Germany) as well as locals will embark on the first North Korea Surf Camp and Expedition on the beaches of Sijung and Hamh\u016dng on the country\u2019s east coast. The week-long camp will be led by Nicola Zanella, Italian surfer and Chinese national surfing team coach, and Andrea Lee, chief executive of US travel company Uri Tours. The trip has obtained permission from the North Korean government, thanks mostly to connections Uri Tours has developed with the country\u2019s tourism board. \u201cWe will not be the first to go surging surf in North Korea \u2013 a group already surfed last year with some locals,\u201d says Zanella. \u201cBut no one has yet done it with the intention of opening the country to surfing tourism \u2013 or to do surfing reconnaissance.\u201d By \u201csurfing reconnaissance,\u201d he means that in order to determine which areas might be best suited to beginner and intermediate surfers, the surf camp will study the country\u2019s coastline in depth, analysing the beaches and the seabed, pinpointing potential evacuation points and estimating which kinds of weather produce ideal surf conditions, and where. The study is integral for developing the country\u2019s surf tourism; that it\u2019s being done by foreigners is highly unusual for hermetic North Korea. From research Zanella has done with Google Maps, he thinks the areas of Sijung and Hamh\u016dng, each a bumpy, six-hour drive north-east from Pyongyang, might be perfect for surfing. \u201cIt looks like there are wild forests that lead to pink- or yellow-sand bays,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is promising for surfing, as the cliffs protect the bay from wind coming off the ocean, but at the same time leaves the bay completely exposed to coastal storms.\u201d The camp is being held in September because Zanella hopes to benefit from wind and waves from the north-east and east, possibly from a monsoon that could blow from Japan. Aside from surfing lessons, a bonfire and dinner on the beach, the $2,750 trip will offer participants a ride on Pyongyang\u2019s metro, a visit to the demilitarised zone and \u2013 as required on any tour of the country \u2013 bowing before the statues of former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. Flights to and from Shanghai, where the group will meet, are not included; the flight to Pyongyang is with Air Koryo (recently named worst airline in the world, for the fourth year running), and accommodation is in three- and four-star hotels in Pyongyang, Sijung and Hamh\u016dng. Local guides will escort the surfers for the entire trip. As to the ethical issues of travelling in North Korea, Lee of Uri Tours says: \u201cWe wrestle with ethical issues every day in our business, but ultimately we believe in what we do. Tourism does benefit the local economy in North Korea: it creates jobs and opportunities for a wide spectrum of people.\u201d There have already have been discussions about the possibility of another camp in 2016. For now, though, the programme\u2019s future is not yet scheduled. \u201cI would be lying if I said that surfing will become a rapidly growing market in North Korea,\u201d Zanella says. \u201cI imagine the first step will be a surf school with professional surf instructors teaching locals. If they need help with that, I would be there to help them.\u201d As for the big question of why go surfing in North Korea at all, Zanella doesn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cSurfing is not just an American or a Hawaiian sport. It is a human right. I think that North Korea deserves it as much as other countries.\u201d",
