    "content": "The UN security council will begin behind-the-scenes negotiations today designed to strengthen sanctions against North Korea after the communist state appeared to have successfully tested a nuclear weapon as powerful as the one that destroyed Hiroshima. With the 15-member council called to an emergency session last night, diplomats scrambled to forge a unified front against the test which was seen as a provocative step towards North Korea gaining a full nuclear arsenal. Early this morning it was reported that North Korea is ready to test another missile. Yonhap news agency quoted a South Korean official as saying that North Korea will fire another short-range missile off its west coast either later today or on Wednesday. Barack Obama spoke at the White House, denouncing North Korea's action as \"a blatant violation of international law\". He said North Korea \"will not find security and respect through threats and illegal weapons\". Japan, which considers itself high on Pyongyang's potential hit list, said it would seek a fresh UN resolution condemning the test. Gordon Brown described the test as \"erroneous, misguided and a danger to the world\". Closed door talks at the UN security council in New York produced no fresh initiative last night beyond a statement condemning the test. But there were signs that several members were prepared to press for tightened sanctions when the hard work begins today seeking a resolution that would be acceptable to all parties. Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, made clear she would urging fresh punitive moves, saying the US would seek \"a strong resolution with strong measures\".\" All eyes will now be turning to China, North Korea's biggest ally, which has in the past been wary to tighten the screw on its neighbour. Despite its cautious stance, Beijing said it \"resolutely opposed\" the test and urged Pyongyang to avoid actions that would sharpen tensions and to return to six-party disarmament talks. Early yesterday South Korea said it had detected a tremor consistent with those caused by an underground nuclear explosion. The country's Yonhap news agency reported that North Korea also test-fired three short-range missiles from a base on the east coast immediately after the nuclear test. The underground atomic explosion, at 9.54am local time (0154 BST), created an earthquake measuring magnitude 4.5 in Kilju county in the country's north-east, reports said. Russian defence experts estimated the explosion's yield at between 10 and 20 -kilotons, many times more than the 1 kiloton measured in its first nuclear test in 2006 and about as powerful as the bombs the US used against Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the second world war. One kiloton is equal to the force produced by 1,000 tonnes of TNT. The force of the blast made the ground tremble in the Chinese border city of Yanji, 130 miles away. North Korea had warned of a second nuclear test after the UN condemned its ballistic missile test on 5 April and agreed to tighten sanctions put in place in 2006. Pyongyang said it had put a communications satellite in orbit, but experts said the technology and methods were identical to those used to launch the long-range Taepodong-2 missile. After the UN refused to apologise for condemning the launch, North Korea expelled international inspectors, threatened to restart its Yongbyon nuclear reactor \u2013 which it had agreed to start dismantling in 2007 \u2013 and walked away from the six-party nuclear talks. The KNCA news agency, the regime's official mouthpiece, said yesterday: \"We have successfully conducted another nuclear test on 25 May as part of the republic's measures to strengthen its nuclear deterrent.\" The agency added the test had been \"safely conducted on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control. The test will contribute to defending the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism and ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula and the region.\" Yesterday's test will add to fears that North Korea is moving closer to possessing the ability to put a nuclear warhead on long-range missiles that are capable, in theory, of reaching Hawaii and Alaska. Analysts believe the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, hopes to use the test to shore up support from the military amid speculation that he is about to name one of his three sons as his successor. Kim, 67, appears to be re-establishing his grip on power since reportedly suffering a stroke last August.",
