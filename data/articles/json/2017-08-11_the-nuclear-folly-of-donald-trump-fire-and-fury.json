    "content": "You report (10 August) that the US has warned North Korea that it risks the destruction of its people. However, the US is risking the destruction of all people. Of eight Trident submarines stationed at Bangor, Washington state, at least two are probably on patrol in the western Pacific. Each is believed to carry 108 nuclear warheads, equivalent to more than 1,400 Hiroshima-sized detonations. The US is supported by the UK, which has four Trident subs at Faslane in Scotland, and holds to Nato\u2019s policy of first use on nuclear arms. Rather than sign the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons \u2013 agreed by 122 states at the UN \u2013 the US and UK pursue a \u201cDo as I say, not as I do\u201d policy. More balanced voices in the foreign policies of both governments are urgently needed. Rae Street Littleborough, Lancashire \u2022 The photo of the mass rally in Pyongyang (Trump says \u2018fire and fury\u2019 threat to Kim is not tough enough, 11 August) shows a crowd way bigger than at Trump\u2019s inauguration. Is this what gets up his nose? No doubt Trump would also like to be able to command large crowds at his whim. Michael Miller Sheffield \u2022 Five years ago I was privileged, as part of a team of \u201cGames Makers\u201d, to chauffeur the North Korea Paralympic Team \u2013 which consisted of one competitor, Rim Ju-song, and a small supporting entourage. I was struck not only by their dedication, but also their sense of humour, good manners and informed curiosity about British culture. In short, they appeared model citizens of the world. I make this point in the hope that, in this futile nuclear dance, we do not judge a people by its leaders \u2013 whether Kim Jong-un or Donald Trump \u2013 or think of them as fodder for the \u201cfire and fury\u201d brigade, simply because they are in the unfortunate position of being ruled by individuals of dubious character. Alan Corcoran Godalming, Surrey \u2022 Is it time to fight Kim with Kim? If the Trump administration engaged Kim Kardashian as a US special envoy, her unique combination of wealth, glamour and business acumen could charm Kim Jong-un, and unpick the beliefs underpinning the pariah regime. The coup de grace? A Kanye West gig in Pyongyang. Michael Lister Manchester",
