    "content": "Late-night hosts on Wednesday discussed the first anniversary of the Mueller investigation, Betsy DeVos\u2019s stance on for-profit universities, and the suspension of diplomatic talks between North and South Korea. Stephen Colbert \u201cI am so excited because tomorrow is the one-year anniversary of the Mueller investigation,\u201d began Stephen Colbert. \u201cOf course, the first anniversary is traditionally the paper anniversary and, with any luck, that is what Mueller is going to be serving Donald Trump with. \u201cA grand jury has been impaneled in Washington and, by law, it has to be a jury of Donald Trump\u2019s peers,\u201d the host continued. \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s Sean Hannity, the cast of Shark Tank, and a cheeseburger. \u201cMeanwhile, way on the other side of town, the president himself is freaking out,\u201d Colbert said, noting a Washington Post report in which an aide to the president claims he rants about the FBI\u2019s raid on Michael Cohen\u2019s office 20 times a day. \u201cNow, a lot of people say Trump\u2019s attacks on the investigation make him look guilty,\u201d Colbert added, before noting that Christopher Ruddy, a Trump confidant quoted in the Washington Post report, explained that \u201che just has to respond. He\u2019s been so emotional \u2026 It takes a toll on him, and the way he deals with it is to lash out.\u201d Elsewhere in the article, a source says that Trump complains he needs better \u201cTV lawyers\u201d to defend him on cable news. \u201cAnd who does Trump think is a TV lawyer upgrade?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cFormer New York mayor Rudy Giuliani. \u201cGiuliani says he and Trump are in lockstep on strategy. In fact, he says of his relationship with Trump, we\u2019re on the same wavelength,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cYes, they\u2019re so close, it\u2019s like they finish each other\u2019s prison sentences.\u201d Trevor Noah Meanwhile, Comedy Central\u2019s Trevor Noah discussed Betsy DeVos\u2019s deliberate crackdown on Department of Education investigations into shady for-profit universities. \u201cWhile much of the world is focused on which nuclear conflict will destroy it, back here in the US, the president\u2019s cabinet is forging ahead,\u201d Noah said. \u201cJust look at Betsy DeVos, secretary of education and the stepmom who definitely killed the original mom. \u201cDeVos has been criticized for not doing more to support struggling schools,\u201d the host said. \u201cThe good new is she\u2019s finally stepping up to provide some help. The bad news is it\u2019s to the wrong schools.\u201d Noah proceeded to cite a report in the New York Times, which writes that the department is dissolving units dedicated to investigating fraud at for-profit colleges, while killing investigations and reassigning workers assigned to them. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with for-profit colleges, they\u2019re the shady schools whose ads you probably know from TV,\u201d Noah said, adding that \u201cmany of these for-profit schools are allegedly scams\u201d. \u201cThey put students into deep debt without teaching them useful skills or training them for good jobs,\u201d the host explained. \u201cAnd thanks to government investigations, we learned just how false their advertising actually is.\u201d A Federal Trade Commission investigation into DeVry University, for instance, showed that the school deceived students about their chances of getting a job and increasing their income. \u201cThe Obama administration cracked down on for-profit schools for deceptive practices,\u201d Noah went on, pointing out that it forced the university to pay over $100m in settlements. \u201cNow, under Betsy DeVos, the education department is shutting these investigations down, which makes sense when you learn who she put in charge of them.\u201d DeVos, the host noted, tapped Julian Schmoke, a former dean at DeVry University, to lead the Student Aid Enforcement Unit, established by the Obama administration to crack down on fraud at colleges and universities. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Noah said. \u201cDeVos appointed a former dean from one of the schools accused of fraud to head the unit investigating the schools for fraud.\u201d Seth Meyers NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers focused on diplomatic talks between the US and North Korea, which may now be off the table. \u201cAs Trump\u2019s impending summit with North Korea gets closer, his supporters have been insisting he be given the Nobel peace prize for his efforts,\u201d Meyers began, before offering the president a fake gold medallion. The host then aired a news segment from Wednesday, when North Korea threatened to torpedo the planned summit and suspended talks with South Korea, which were supposed to resume on Thursday, because of its participation in military drills with the US. \u201cDiplomacy with North Korea is a good thing and it\u2019s the only way to resolve this situation without armed conflict,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cBut the worry has always been that the Trump administration wasn\u2019t fully prepared for the negotiations.\u201d \u201cWhen the news broke yesterday, those suspicions seemed to be confirmed,\u201d he added, before showing news coverage claiming the administration was \u201ccaught off guard\u201d by North Korea\u2019s announcement. \u201cAt a moment like this you want to hear calm, steady leadership from the president assuring the public that the situation is under control,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cInstead, when he was asked if the summit was still on, he kind of made it sound like he was in the dark.\u201d Trump, when asked by reporters on Wednesday about the summit, replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see\u201d, adding, \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen anything, we haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anything or heard anything?,\u201d Meyers asked incredulously. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, but Mr President, you should watch more TV.\u201d",
