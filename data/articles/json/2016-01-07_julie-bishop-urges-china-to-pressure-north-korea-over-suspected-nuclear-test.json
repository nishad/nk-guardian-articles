    "content": "Australia has urged China to use its influence over North Korea to seek to rein in the regime\u2019s \u201cprovocative and dangerous behaviour\u201d after a suspected nuclear test. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, joined the United States and South Korea in expressing scepticism about North Korea\u2019s claims to have successfully tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb on Wednesday, saying it had exaggerated its technical prowess in the past. But Bishop said Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime was escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and proving a threat to regional stability and international security. Asked on ABC radio about the notion that Pyongyang could make a nuclear weapon small enough to fit on a missile that could reach Australia, Bishop said this was \u201cthe concern of countries like Australia\u201d while cautioning that \u201cthe details of the precise weapon are not yet established\u201d. As the United Nations security council considers ratcheting up sanctions on North Korea, Bishop emphasised the role that China should play, even as she acknowledged limits to Beijing\u2019s influence over Pyongyang. \u201cChina will be key to ensuring that the sanctions are imposed and that the relationship between Chinese companies and individuals and North Korea doesn\u2019t lessen the impact of the sanctions,\u201d she said on Thursday. \u201cChina is clearly frustrated with North Korea\u2019s behaviour, it has been for some time, and I think there\u2019s been a cooling of relations between Beijing and Pyongyang, but nevertheless China is its closest ally, its only friend if you like, and China does have considerable influence over North Korea. \u201c[The influence is] perhaps not as much as the international community would wish, but nevertheless as a neighbour and as a friend of North Korea, China can continue to exert pressure to ensure that the leader of North Korea abides by international norms and progresses the denuclearisation of the weapons program.\u201d North Korean state media announced the fourth nuclear test on Wednesday after seismologists from other countries said they had detected a 5 magnitude earthquake that could have been caused by an explosion. The television announcer said the country would \u201cnot give up a nuclear program as long as the United States maintains its stance of aggression\u201d. North Korean claims about the device have not been independently verified. The White House said initial analysis was \u201cnot consistent with the claim the regime has made a successful hydrogen bomb test\u201d. Some experts have suggested the activity was similar to a 2013 test involving a less-powerful atomic fission device. Australia\u2019s main political parties have expressed a similar message of concern about North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. The acting leader of the Labor opposition, Penny Wong, said the testing of a hydrogen bomb would be \u201ca clear and serious violation\u201d of UN security council resolutions. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear program is a threat to global security and presents a major threat to peace in north-east Asia,\u201d Wong said. \u201cWe condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\u201d",
