    "content": "The Australian government has cast doubt over whether Donald Trump has suspended military exercises with South Korea, noting that was not part of the joint declaration between the United States and North Korea. On Wednesday the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said the suspension of war games \u2013 a surprise concession offered by the US president on Tuesday night that caught South Korea by surprise \u2013 was not in the official declaration but \u201cthe president spoke about it in answer to a question at a press conference\u201d. \u201cIt was not part of the declaration, so we have to take the declaration as being the areas of agreement and build on that,\u201d she said. The US had previously ruled out suspending military exercises because they have been a big part of its military alliance with South Korea and a deterrent against the north.

Bishop said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that suspension for suspension has actually been agreed. The declaration sets up the four points of agreement. \u201cThe president has raised a whole range of other issues in his press conference but I think it is too early to say that anything like suspension for suspension has occurred.\u201d Speaking later, the prime minister struck a noticeably more upbeat tone. Malcolm Turnbull declined to answer a question about whether Bishop\u2019s remarks reflected a briefing provided by US officials on Wednesday morning. He instead suggested Trump\u2019s comment about suspending military exercises was \u201cpart of the negotiating\u201d. Trump was giving denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula \u201ca red-hot go\u201d. \u201cLook, president Trump is a deal-maker,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a businessman who has brought a lifetime\u2019s experience of doing deals, of getting to know people, of being able to persuade them to come to an agreement. \u201cAnd he has chosen to take a very dynamic, very personal approach to this that none of his predecessors have done in the past. \u201cIt\u2019s not one that\u2019s been undertaken before. But, you know what? The other approaches haven\u2019t worked.\u201d Bishop made it clear that agreement between Trump and the North Korean dictator had to involve \u201ccomplete, verifiable, irreversible\u201d denuclearisation. Those conditions were absent from the wording of the joint declaration. When asked why, Trump said on Tuesday: \u201cBecause there\u2019s no time. I\u2019m here one day. It wasn\u2019t a big point today because really \u2026 this has been taken care of before we got here.\u201d Bishop said Australia had already offered its services with regards to denuclearisation \u201cbecause we have expertise in that regard\u201d. While expressing cautious optimism about events of the past 48 hours, Bishop stressed the strength of the agreement between Trump and Kim Jong-un \u201cwill only be as good as the verification process that North Korea allows\u201d. \u201cWe can only determine the success of this meeting by the outcomes, and that will take some time,\u201d she said. \u201cNorth Korea has committed to a complete denuclearisation. We are yet to understand what North Korea means by denuclearisation. \u201cWe understand what the United States and its allies mean. That is, the complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of the nuclear weapons program that is in defiance of numerous UN security council resolutions.\u201d Bishop said the sanctions against North Korea remained in place and would not be removed until such time as North Korea had proven it has dismantled its nuclear weapons program. She said the global community was at the beginning of a very long process: \u201cThe detail is still to be worked through. There will be many more meetings, much more dialogue, a lot of diplomatic work to be done.\u201d On Wednesday Japan\u2019s defence chief said the US military\u2019s presence in South Korea and joint military exercises were \u201cvital\u201d for east Asian security. \u201cWe would like to seek an understanding of this between Japan, the US and South Korea,\u201d Japan\u2019s defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said. Japan would continue joint military exercises with the US and would stick to plans to bolster its defences against a possible ballistic missile strike from North Korea. Although Trump claimed credit on Tuesday evening for the breakthrough \u2013 saying \u201ca different president\u201d had put relations on a more productive course \u2013 Bishop said on Wednesday morning that the sanctions had been an important catalyst in drawing Kim to the table. Turnbull echoed that line: \u201cI want to say that I do not believe that summit would have occurred had it not been for the absolute solidarity on the very tough economic sanctions on North Korea that have been imposed by the UN security council, that\u2019s had the support, obviously, of the United States and Japan and Australia and other countries, but also China. \u201cI share president Trump\u2019s assessment of that when he thanked the leaders of Japan and South Korea and China for the solidarity they\u2019ve shown.\u201d",
