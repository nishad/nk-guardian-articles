    "content": "This week was a reminder that although Donald Trump often seems most at home squabbling with TV hosts and TV channels, some of the more serious responsibilities of the US president arrive on his desk whether he likes it or not \u2013 in this case, the shadow of a North Korean missile and a first meeting with Vladimir Putin. Last weekend Trump began Saturday keen not to let his feud with MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough drop, calling Brzezinski \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d and Scarborough \u201ccrazy\u201d. His tweet the previous week suggesting Brzezinski had been \u201cbleeding badly from a face-lift\u201d during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s Florida resort, had spiralled into an accusation of blackmail against White House staff from the two presenters. The president also suggested \u2013 without offering evidence \u2013 that states refusing to turn over sensitive voter information to his newly convened commission on election integrity had something to hide. At least 24 states have either resisted the request on privacy protection grounds or rejected it as a backdoor effort at mass voter suppression. That night Trump lashed out at the \u201cfake media\u201d, telling an evangelical event in Washington: \u201cThe fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House. But I\u2019m president, and they\u2019re not.\u201d And on Sunday he followed that up by tweeting a video of himself at a pro-wrestling event throwing to the floor a man with a CNN logo superimposed over his head. It quickly became one of the president\u2019s most controversial social media posts, in a competitive field, leading to accusations that he was encouraging violence against reporters. Last month, the Republican congressman Greg Gianforte was sentenced to community service and given a $385 fine after pleading guilty to an eve-of-election assault on the Guardian journalist Ben Jacobs. Monday In a change of tone, the president offered to help the parents of a critically ill British baby who had lost a legal fight to take him to the United States for treatment. Medical specialists had argued that the treatment was experimental and would not help. The White House stated that, contrary to reports, the president would not be making a surprise visit to his Scottish golf course in the next two weeks, as the threat of short-notice protests mounted in Britain. That night, as 4 July dawned in Asia, North Korea marked America\u2019s Independence Day with the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile that experts said was able to reach Alaska, and therefore the continental United States, for the first time. \u201cDoes this guy have anything better to do with his life?\u201d Trump mused of North Korean\u2019s leader, Kim Jung-un, on Twitter, a comment some felt could be applied to his own social media habits. And he suggested that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s closest ally and biggest economic partner \u2013 might \u201cput a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!\u201d Tuesday As the US celebrated its national holiday, Kim described the ICBM as a gift for the \u201cAmerican bastards\u201d and urged his nuclear scientists to \u201cfrequently send big and small \u2018gift packages\u2019 to the Yankees\u201d in the form of more missile and nuclear tests. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, agreed to \u201cjointly push for a proper settlement \u2026 via dialogue and negotiation\u201d with North Korea, Chinese news reports said. The US\u2019s possible range of options for dealing with the mercurial young leader seem universally unpalatable. Wednesday The spread of Russian-made fake news stories aimed at discrediting Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election is emerging as an important line of inquiry in multiple investigations into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow, the Guardian reported. Investigators are looking into whether Trump supporters and far-right websites coordinated with Moscow over the release of fake news, including stories implicating Clinton in murder or paedophilia, or paid to boost those stories on Facebook. Trump himself headed to Europe, stopping first in Poland before Friday\u2019s G20 summit of the world\u2019s major economies in Germany, where he was due to meet Putin for the first time as president, and possibly the first time ever. Thursday At a speech in Warsaw, Trump returned to the themes of strident cultural nationalism associated with his adviser Steve Bannon, suggesting a lack of collective resolve could doom the west and warning of threats from the \u201csouth or the east\u201d. The speech was well received by a crowd bussed in by Poland\u2019s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party in order to guarantee Trump the supportive audience that, according to the local press, he had demanded. The US president had some uncharacteristic criticism for Russia, urging it to \u201ccease its destabilising activities in Ukraine\u201d and stop supporting Syria and Iran, but at a press conference he reverted to type, again challenging the US intelligence verdict on foreign interference in last year\u2019s presidential election, saying: \u201cI think it could very well have been Russia. I think it could well have been other countries ... Nobody really knows for sure.\u201d Back home, the top ethics watchdog in the federal government announced his resignation, taking a parting shot at Trump as he did so. Friday Trump has been contradictory over the years about whether he has ever met Putin in person, with firm assertions that they had indeed met and \u201cgot along great\u201d giving way during the election campaign to a claim that \u201cI never met Putin, I don\u2019t know who Putin is.\u201d Whatever the truth, the two leaders certainly met on Friday, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, but exactly what they discussed during their lengthy two-hour-plus meeting was less clear. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, claimed Trump had told Putin he accepted the Russian leader\u2019s denials of involvement in attempting to sway last year\u2019s American election. But the US secretary of state Rex Tillerson\u2019s account was different. He said Trump had pressed Putin more than once about the Kremlin\u2019s involvement in election tampering, and Putin had denied it. Trump, Tillerson said, was \u201crightly focused on how do we move forward\u201d from the issue \u2013 although US intelligence agencies have warned that Russia will keep up efforts to interfere in US and other elections \u2013 and he said that the two leaders had set up a working group on non-interference in future elections. Since only the two foreign ministers, the two presidents, and their two interpreters, were present, we may never know the truth, although Lavrov\u2019s account is bolstered by Trump\u2019s history of telling audiences what he thinks they want to hear and his frequently expressed scepticism about Moscow\u2019s guilt. In any case, it\u2019s likely the US president will want to give his own version of events via one medium or another before too long. Sign up for the Minute: the day in US politics, condensed",
