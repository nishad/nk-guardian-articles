    "content": "Donald Trump has said he would be \u201chonored\u201d to meet the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, \u201cunder the right circumstances\u201d. Trump did not make clear what preconditions would have to be met for such a meeting to occur, but his administration has demanded a freeze on nuclear and long-range missile tests as well as a readiness to negotiate North Korea\u2019s complete nuclear disarmament. Trump and his senior officials have also stressed that they will consider military options for constraining Kim\u2019s regime if it perseveres with testing nuclear warheads or continues the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the continental US. The administration has sent an aircraft carrier and a guided missile submarine to the region, as a sign of its resolve, though most military analysts say pre-emptive strikes could trigger a catastrophic war. Trump made his suggestion of talks earlier on Monday in an interview with Bloomberg News. \u201cIf it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be honored to do it. If it\u2019s under \u2026 the right circumstances. But I would do that.\u201d \u201cMost political people would never say that,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you under the right circumstances I would meet with him. We have breaking news.\u201d At Monday\u2019s White House press briefing, spokesman Sean Spicer said \u201ca lot of conditions\u201d would have to be met before any summit meeting, and that North Korea\u2019s provocative behaviour would have to be \u201cratcheted down immediately\u201d. Spicer added that Pyongyang would have to \u201cshow signs of good faith\u201d and added: \u201cClearly the conditions are not there right now.\u201d President Trump has made several complimentary references to Kim, describing him in a CBS interview over the weekend as \u201ca smart cookie\u201d. Spicer also offered qualified praise, claiming: \u201cHe\u2019s obviously managed to lead his country forward,\u201d while noting: \u201cHe is a young person to be leading a country with nuclear weapons.\u201d In the years since the armistice ending the Korean war in 1953, there has never been a meeting between US and North Korean leaders. In 2000, the then secretary of state Madeleine Albright met Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il. There has been no high-level contact since then. Trump first offered to meet Kim Jong-un last June, during the election campaign, in order to highlight his differences with Hillary Clinton. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with speaking? And you know what? It\u2019s called opening a dialogue. It\u2019s opening a dialogue,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf he came here, I\u2019d accept him, but I wouldn\u2019t give him a state dinner like we do for China and all these other people that rip us off when we give them these big state dinners.\u201d He went on to suggest he would serve Kim \u2013 and other visiting leaders \u2013 \u201ca hamburger on a conference table\u201d. However, his overtures were stonewalled by Pyongyang on Monday, with the North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry saying the country would speed up measures to bolster its nuclear program \u201cat the maximum pace\u201d in response to the new US sanctions. A statement from the foreign ministry spokesman said the government was ready to respond to any option taken by the United States. It said that during recent US-South Korean military drills, \u201cUS aggression hysteria\u201d reached its highest point and the situation on the Korean peninsula inched closer \u201cto the brink of nuclear war.\u201d Since coming to office in January, Trump has sent conflicting signals about his administration\u2019s policy on North Korea, its readiness to use force, the culpability of China in failing to rein Pyongyang in, and its readiness to talk directly to Kim\u2019s regime. Last week, the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, raised the possibility of direct talks as long as denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula was on the agenda. Last July, the North Korean regime declared itself in favour of that goal. Asked for details about the exact preconditions for talks, a state department spokesperson said by email: \u201cFirst and foremost these provocative tests must end. Then we will look for other indications [North Korea] is really ready to engage.\u201d The diplomatic wrangling comes as a controversial missile defence system whose deployment has angered China became operational in South Korea on Monday. Washington and Seoul agreed to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) battery deployment in July in the wake of a string of North Korean missile tests. \u201cIt has reached initial intercept capability,\u201d an official said.",
