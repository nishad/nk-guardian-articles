    "content": "The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has warned further pressure will be brought to bear on North Korea, as the US seeks to remind the \u201crocket man\u201d that military options remain on the table. Bishop, in New York for the UN general assembly, told Guardian Australia through her spokeswoman, there was more room to force North Korea back to the negotiating table. \u201cUnited Nations economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea is one element of a broader strategy to compel Pyongyang to the negotiating table with the intention to abandon its illegal weapons programs,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cFurther pressure will be brought to bear including through the UN security council and in coordination with the United States and other countries.\u201d Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday morning, Bishop asked for time for the sanctions to work. \u201cI believe that the Korean regime is seeking to maximise its leverage in order to get the best possible negotiating position with the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see North Korea rush to the negotiating table and we need to exert considerable economic pressure, as we have done in the past. \u201cThat has happened in the past when North Korea has been subjected to sanctions, certainly not as comprehensive as the current round of sanctions, but they have returned to the negotiating table and that is what we are seeking to do.\u201d How to deal with Kim Jong-un\u2019s North Korea is dominating the UN talks, which is also grappling with relations with the US president, Donald Trump, and his repeated public criticisms of the body. Just days after the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said the latest provocation by North Korea meant the sanctions were working, the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said if diplomatic means failed, \u201cGeneral Mattis will take care of it.\u201d A retired Marine Corps general, James Mattis serves as the Trump administration\u2019s secretary of defence. Haley, speaking to CNN, said Trump\u2019s promise of \u201cfire and fury\u201d was not an empty threat. \u201cIf North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed, and we know that and none of us want that,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of us want war.\u201d Turnbull has repeatedly confirmed Australia would side with the US in the event of an attack, as part of the Anzus agreement.",
