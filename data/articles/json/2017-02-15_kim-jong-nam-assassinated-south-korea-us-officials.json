    "content": "Kim Jong-nam was almost certainly murdered by North Korean agents, according to intelligence officials in South Korea, as suspicions mounted that his assassination at Kuala Lumpur airport was ordered by his estranged half-brother, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. South Korea\u2019s spy agency said on Wednesday that two women believed to be North Korean operatives poisoned the 45-year-old exile in a shopping concourse at Kuala Lumpur international airport. Kim, who had not yet passed through security, was preparing to take a late-morning flight on Monday from the Malaysian capital to his home in Macau, according to South Korean MPs briefed by security services. Selangor state\u2019s police chief, Abdul Samah Mat, told the Guardian that Kim Jong-nam arrived in Malaysia on 6 February, a week before he was attacked. \u201cHe was travelling on a North Korean passport,\u201d he said. \u201cThe postmortem is in progress. It\u2019s up to the pathologists on how long it will take. Sometimes it involves lab tests.\u201d US government sources also said they believed that Kim Jong-nam was murdered by North Korean assassins. Japan\u2019s Kyodo news agency quoted an unnamed Japanese government official as saying that the two suspected assailants may already be dead, but offered no further details. The theory that Kim had been targeted by spies from the country he left more than 15 years ago gathered pace after Malaysian officials released CCTV image purporting to show one of the alleged attackers as she waited for a taxi outside the airport shortly after the incident. The local Malay Mail newspaper published a grainy photo of a woman it said was suspected by police of killing Kim Jong-nam. The image showed a young female, carrying a bag and wearing a white jumper that said \u201cLOL\u201d in large black print across the front. The Guardian has been unable to confirm if the woman is a police suspect. Kim, whose father was the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, claimed to have no political ambitions, but just weeks after his half-brother\u2019s elevation to the leadership in late 2011 he told the Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi that the world would view his leadership as a \u201cjoke\u201d. In the same email exchange with Gomi, Kim spoke disparagingly of his younger brother, saying he lacked \u201cany sense of duty or seriousness\u201d and warned that bribery and corruption would lead to North Korea\u2019s eventual collapse. Two years earlier, he told Japan\u2019s TV Asahi that he \u201cpersonally opposed\u201d the hereditary transfer of power in his family. People with contacts in the north believe Kim Jong-un had long targeted his brother, who reportedly divided his time between Macau, China and Singapore, and enjoyed some level of Chinese protection. South Korean intelligence officials claimed the regime had been planning his assassination for five years, but did not explain why they thought that was the case. Kim Jong-nam was once considered the heir apparent to the North Korean leadership but left the country to lead a life in exile after attempting to enter Japan on a forged Dominican Republic passport in 2001 \u2013 an incident that caused embarrassment to his father. Kim had told Japanese immigration officials that he was planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Jiro Ishimaru, of the Osaka-based Asia Press, said Kim\u2019s murder could only have been ordered by his half-brother, whom he had never met. \u201cAny criticism of the Kim dynasty is viewed as unforgivable, no matter where it comes from,\u201d Ishimaru told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing you can say about the regime, and certainly not the kind of comment that the leadership would be able to shrug off, no matter how long ago it was said. \u201cThe only person inside North Korea with the power to decide whether Kim Jong-nam lived or died is Kim Jong-un.\u201d Mark Tokola, vice-president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Seoul, agreed, saying: \u201cIt seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un.\u201d Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong-nam was plotting against the leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who want to depose his brother. Kim Jong-nam had told airport workers that someone had attacked him \u201cfrom behind\u201d and sprayed him in the face with an unknown liquid. He died in an ambulance on the way to hospital. \u201cHe told the receptionist at the departure hall that someone had grabbed his face from behind and splashed some liquid on him,\u201d said Selangor state\u2019s criminal investigation chief, Fadzil Ahmat, according to Malaysia\u2019s The Star newspaper. \u201cHe asked for help and was immediately sent to the airport\u2019s clinic. At this point, he was experiencing headache and was on the verge of passing out. At the clinic, the victim experienced a mild seizure. He was put into an ambulance and was being taken to the Putrajaya hospital when he was pronounced dead.\u201d Malaysian police confirmed the death of a 45-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang. \u201cInvestigation is in progress and a postmortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,\u201d the statement said. South Korea\u2019s government called an emergency security council meeting and condemned Kim\u2019s death. \u201cIf the murder of Kim Jong-nam was confirmed to be committed by the North Korean regime, that would clearly depict the brutality and inhumanity of the Kim Jong-un regime,\u201d the country\u2019s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, said. In exile, Kim Jong-nam had largely managed to stay out of the spotlight. He had lived both in mainland China and Macau, and was also spotted in Malaysia. He reportedly fled to Singapore from Macau in 2012, fearing for his life after his brother assumed power, and suspecting that the regime\u2019s agents had discovered where he lived. It is not clear if he had returned in recent years, but his family \u2013 his second wife and their three children \u2013 were living in the former Portuguese colony. A South Korean MP claimed Kim also had a wife and son in Beijing. He was known to travel around Macau without bodyguards, and was occasionally spotted at nightclubs in the Hotel Lisboa, according to a 2007 investigation by the South China Morning Post. Since becoming leader in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has sought to tighten his grip on power by ordering the purges and, in some cases, executions of high-level officials he believes represent a threat to the regime. The most high-profile victim was his uncle and close adviser, Jang Song-thaek, who was executed on several charges, including treason, in 2013. North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot Kim Jong-nam in Macau in 2011, although details of the incident are shrouded in mystery. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organise a hit-and-run targeting Kim in China in 2010. Kim reportedly pleaded for his life after another attempt to kill him in 2012, according to South Korean lawmakers who had been briefed by the head of the country\u2019s national intelligence service, Lee Byung-ho. \u201cAccording to [Lee] \u2026 there was one [assassination] bid in 2012, and Jong-nam in April 2012 sent a letter to Kim Jong-un saying: \u2018Please spare me and my family,\u2019\u201d Kim Byung-kee, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters.
