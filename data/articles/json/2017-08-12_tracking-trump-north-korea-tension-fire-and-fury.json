    "content": "It was a week in which Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia and domestic issues such as healthcare took a back seat, and probably the most intractable problem in the president\u2019s foreign policy in-tray came to the fore, as Trump and North Korea competed to ratchet up the rhetoric over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal. Last weekend At the United Nations on Saturday, the UN security council voted unanimously to impose new sanctions on North Korea for its recent missile tests, cutting about a third of its export revenue. Trump said he was \u201cvery happy and impressed\u201d with the vote, which saw both China and Russia side against Pyongyang in the wake of a test which experts said meant North Korea could now potentially reach the continental United States. Vice-President Mike Pence has walked a tightrope few others in the White House have managed during the seven months of Trump\u2019s presidency: keeping himself out of the jaws of the Russia inquiry \u2013 despite questions over what he knew about the fired national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2013 and out of the line of fire of his boss\u2019s Twitter account. So far, anyway. On Sunday, Pence was forced to push back forcefully against a New York Times article suggesting he is preparing for a presidential run in 2020, calling it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d, \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201ccategorically false\u201d in a statement many saw as largely directed towards one reader: the man currently on vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Sorry, my mistake \u2013 as Trump tweeted on Saturday: \u201cThis is not a vacation \u2013 meetings and calls!\u201d Monday North Korea reacted badly to the UN sanctions, vowing to exact a \u201cthousand-fold\u201d revenge on the US and threatening to take \u201crighteous action\u201d in response. \u201cThere is no bigger mistake than the United States believing that its land is safe across the ocean,\u201d the KCNA state news agency said. Elsewhere, the Guardian revealed that two congressional staffers had travelled to London last month to contact Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer behind the infamous unconfirmed Trump dossier, on the orders of an aide to Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House intelligence committee and a close ally of the White House. The committee is investigating links between Trump and Russia and the revelation shone a light on the power struggle for control of the inquiry. Tuesday Tensions with North Korea continued to rise, with Japan warning that Pyongyang may now have the acquired the ability to miniaturise nuclear warheads \u2013 necessary if it wants to use its new intercontinental ballistic missiles for a nuclear strike on the US. That warning was followed by a story in the Washington Post stating that US intelligence agencies believed the same thing. That development appeared to prompt a startlingly bellicose response from Trump, who told journalists at his Bedminster golf club: \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\u201d As experts warned that such bombastic threats could lead Kim Jong-un to overreact, North Korea said it was \u201ccarefully examining\u201d a plan for a missile strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam \u2013 home to significant US naval and air bases \u2013 and could carry out a pre-emptive operation if the US showed signs of \u201cprovocation\u201d. In domestic news, at an event billed as a \u201cmajor briefing\u201d on the US opioid crisis, the president rebuffed a call from his commission on the subject to declare the situation a national emergency, and focused instead on harsher sentences and policing the Mexican border, without mentioning the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture many addictive painkillers such as Vicodin and OxyContin within the US. The health secretary, Tom Price, said the administration did not think it was necessary to declare an emergency \u201calthough all things are on the table for the president\u201d. Critics claimed the president was stuck in a 1980s view of how to tackle drug abuse. Wednesday Defying Trump\u2019s pledge to respond militarily to any more threats from North Korea, Pyongyang set out a detailed plan to attack Guam, with Gen Kim Rak-gyom, the head of the country\u2019s strategic forces, outlining a demonstration launch of four intermediate-range missiles that would fly over Japan and then land in the sea around the US territory, \u201cenveloping\u201d the island. The statement said the plan for this show of force would be ready by the middle of this month and then await orders from Kim. Trump\u2019s comments, it said, were a \u201cload of nonsense\u201d and the president himself was \u201ca guy bereft of reason \u2026 only absolute force can work on him\u201d. In Russia news, it emerged that the FBI used a search warrant to raid the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s home late last month \u2013 indicating agents are likely to have had probable cause to believe Manafort might not comply with a subpoena request to hand over all relevant records. Thursday Addressing reporters at Bedminster at two wide ranging Q&amp;A sessions on Thursday, Trump warned Kim that if \u201che does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody\u2019s seen before, what will happen in North Korea\u201d and mused that his \u201cfire and fury\u201d statement of earlier in the week may not have been tough enough. He would not rule out a pre-emptive strike, but also said he would consider negotiations. The president also seemed to reverse course on the opioid epidemic, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re going to draw it up and we\u2019re going to make it a national emergency.\u201d It was not immediately clear whether this would lead to a formal declaration, something that would empower the government to quickly expand access to in-patient treatment services and negotiate lower prices for the overdose reversal drug naloxone. In stark contrast to his condemnation of US sanctions against Russia last week, Trump praised Russia\u2019s sanctions against the US, saying it was good Vladimir Putin had ordered the US to cut 755 diplomatic staff in Russia because \u201cwe\u2019re trying to cut down our payroll and as far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll\u201d. While continuing to deny collusion with Russia over what US intelligence says was Moscow\u2019s attempt to swing the election in his favour last year, Trump seemed to acknowledge that some of his staff might have broken rules regarding their meetings with Russians. \u201cDid they do something wrong because they didn\u2019t file the right document or whatever?\u201d he asked. \u201cPerhaps, you\u2019d have to look at them, but I guarantee you this, there are probably a lot of people in Washington who did the same thing.\u201d As for Manafort, the raid on his house was \u201cpretty tough stuff\u201d, the president said. A study found that the uncertainty triggered by the Trump administration\u2019s statements and actions regarding the future of Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare reforms is triggering double-digit premium increases on individual health insurance policies purchased by many consumers. Trump made time to attack Mitch McConnell on the issue, suggesting the Republican leader in the Senate might have to step down if he failed to enact his legislative agenda. \u201cMitch, get back to work and put Repeal &amp; Replace, Tax Reform &amp; Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing,\u201d he instructed the veteran senator later on Twitter, adding encouragingly: \u201cYou can do it!\u201d Friday As the US and South Korea prepared for scheduled military exercises later this month \u2013 now fraught with tension \u2013 Trump kept the pressure up on Kim with a tweet on Friday morning threatening Pyongyang again, but indicating he wanted to avoid hostilities. \u201cMilitary solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!\u201d But despite the gung-ho language there was no change in US deployments in the region or a change in the alert status of US forces. And it was reported on Friday that the Trump administration had reopened a channel of communication between American and North Korean diplomats at the United Nations. Trump later said of Kim: \u201cIf he utters one threat, in the form of an overt threat ... or if he does anything with respect to Guam, or any place else that\u2019s an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast.\u201d Worrying stuff.

One bedroom wall features the plaque: \u201cIn this bedroom, President Donald J Trump was likely conceived, by his parents, Fred and Mary Trump.
