    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/06/donald-trump-cnn-feud-conservative-writers",
    "content": "This week was marked by a spiralling conflict between the president and his least favorite cable news outlet, CNN. Last week, a Reddit user posted a meme featuring Trump appearing to wrestle CNN. The meme was then tweeted by the president himself. The clip was a response to a bad week for the network, including a retracted story about a member of his transition team. CNN\u2019s response included tracking down the meme\u2019s creator, whom it did not identify, but with a caveat that rightwing social media accounts interpreted as a threat \u2013 everyone from Julian Assange to Donald Trump Jr was promoting the hashtag #CNNBlackmail. It\u2019s not normal for the president to be spitting out juvenile memes as part of a war against a particular media outlet. But it\u2019s also odd for a news organization to hunt down a Reddit user, and say that it will preserve his anonymity if he promises to be good. With several wars apparently looming, it seems like a distraction neither side can afford. Naturally, the rightwing media are mostly on Trump\u2019s side, but some writers have raised some uncomfortable questions. No one emerges from Trump\u2019s feud with the media looking good Publication: National Review Author: Ben Shapiro \u2013 who walked out on Breitbart at the peak of its influence \u2013 now publishes in a range of places, including National Review. He has retained his habit of making isolated fair points in an overwhelmingly self-serving and objectionable context. Why you should read it: One of Shapiro\u2019s few redeeming features is that he is no friend of Trump\u2019s. Of course, he\u2019s not a big fan of CNN, either. He takes the opportunity to lash out at both, and almost incidentally arrives at the reasonable conclusion that no one has come out of this looking good, and both parties are in fact deriving some value from the situation. Extract: \u201cSo here we are: a media nobody trusts schoolmarming a president who\u2019s simply the class clown. Nobody looks good in this particular fake wrestling match; the question is why anyone engages in it at all. After all, we know that the match isn\u2019t real. Trump so adores the media attention that if CNN and the New York Times were to stop covering him, he\u2019d quickly set himself on fire outside their offices. Likewise, if Trump were to stop tweeting, CNN would have to go back to covering missing Malaysian airliners.\u201d The brilliant wrestling match tweet Publication: Washington Times Author: Tammy Bruce is a columnist for the Washington Times, which she rounds out with a familiar roster of rightwing media activities \u2013 talk radio, books and Fox News spots. Why you should read it: We can agree with Bruce that Donald Trump is a top-shelf Twitter troll. We may disagree that this is something we should want in someone who has the power of life and death over all of us. Extract: \u201cThe truth is this: Mr Trump is simply the world\u2019s greatest provocateur. As a businessman and entertainer, he understands the benefits of keeping your opponents on their heels. Ridicule and mockery of your opponents is one of mankind\u2019s oldest political tactics. The provoked can never win, because they\u2019re allowing emotions to dictate their actions, revealing themselves as undisciplined, unserious fools.\u201d CNN threatens to dox Redditor who created the Wrestlemania gif Trump tweeted Publication: The Federalist Author: Bethany Mandel is a senior writer at the Federalist, ranging over familiar conservative topics, but also cooking, and a series of reports on Scientology. Why you should read it: It\u2019s unsurprising that a writer at The Federalist is disposed to absolve Trump of his bizarre behavior. And the fact that so much conservative media refuses to even discuss Trump\u2019s sheer weirdness is a problem for us all, because this feeds into the blind loyalty of parts of his base. Nevertheless, Mandel does raise the uncomfortable point that there is something odd, and disproportionate, about a cable news network hunting down some guy from Reddit. \u201cHanAssholeSolo\u201d is hardly someone we should be too upset about in particular. Is this news? Is this what we need to be discussing? Extract: \u201cThink or say anything negative about CNN and play into President Trump\u2019s war against them, even in your capacity as a private citizen, and you may have the resources of an international news organization devote themselves to destroying your life. CNN has set a bullseye on not only President Trump, but his fans as well.\u201d Tucker: media howling over \u2018violent\u2019 Trump vapid posturing Publication: Fox News Author: Tucker Carlson Why you should read it: If CNN really is damaged by this incident \u2013 and to be frank, it\u2019s just as likely that it will enhance the loyalty of the channel\u2019s liberal audience \u2013 a clear beneficiary would be its competitor Fox News. Tucker Carlson doesn\u2019t hold back with the gloating here, but he does raise a question: is a trolling wrestling meme really an incitement to violence? Extract: Listen to the whole six minutes. Ted Cruz: CNN could be guilty of a crime for threatening the Redditor who created Trump\u2019s wrestling gif Publication: Hot Air Author: Allahpundit went from independent conservative blogger to writer at the Michelle Malkin-founded Hot Air. Like so many others, he has trod the path from Trump skepticism to anti-anti-Trump difference-splitting. Unlike many others who have been in the game so long, he has managed to remain blissfully pseudonymous. Why you should read it: Allahpundit discusses Ted Cruz\u2019s hints on Twitter that CNN\u2019s actions against the anonymous Redditor may constitute blackmail. But he opens it up into a discussion of whether media outlets should be in the business of retaliating against private citizens who displease them. Of course, none of this comes up when Fox, Breitbart, or the legion of rightwing \u201calt-media\u201d types engage in personal attacks. Next time any of that happens, remind the right that they were making these arguments on behalf of a pretty nasty Reddit user. Extract: \u201cThe issue isn\u2019t whether the Redditor should behave better; the issue is whether a news organization should use its platform to overtly threaten randos for violating norms of civil political discourse. And needless to say, the whole thing stinks 10 times worse than it otherwise would have knowing that the guy is famous for making a gif of Trump attacking CNN itself. Publicly warning someone that his identity might be revealed in the guise of \u201cnews\u201d if he continues past practices of posting alt-right garbage would be bad under any circumstances. Doing it to someone whom the president made famous for anti-CNN propaganda reeks of retaliation.\u201d Sign up for the Minute email. Catch up on today\u2019s US politics news in 60 seconds",
