    "content": "Donald Trump threatened to impose major sanctions on North Korea in response to Pyongyang\u2019s latest test of a ballistic missile, that appeared capable of reaching most if not all of the US mainland. The US president\u2019s remarks were followed by UN ambassador Nikki Haley saying the ballistic missile launch \u201cbrings us closer to war\u201d at an emergency UN security council meeting, which would end the North Korean regime. Trump said in a tweet he had spoken with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, about \u201cthe provocative actions of North Korea\u201d, and promised: \u201cAdditional major sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today. This situation will be handled!\u201d In remarks later on Wednesday at a public event in Missouri, Trump departed from a speech about tax cuts to aim a barb at the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who he has previously referred to as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d. \u201cLittle Rocket Man, he is a sick puppy,\u201d the president said. Later Wednesday, at the UN, Haley said if war comes as a result of further acts of \u201caggression\u201d like the latest launch \u201cmake no mistake the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed\u201d. Haley says the Trump administration warned North Korea that its future is in the hands of its leaders and the choice was theirs. With Tuesday\u2019s launch, she said, Kim\u2019s regime made a choice \u201cand with this choice comes a critical choice for the rest of the world\u201d. She called on all countries to cut all ties to North Korea. The security council was meeting in New York to discuss possible new measures, and the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, made clear that the US would press for tougher measures allowing North Korean shipping to be stopped and searched on the high seas. A White House statement about the phone conversation said Trump made clear \u201cthe determination of the United States to defend ourselves and our allies\u201d. Trump also apparently \u201cemphasized the need for China to use all available levers to convince North Korea to end its provocations and return to the path of denuclearization\u201d. After two and a half months of relative quiet, North Korea said it successfully fired a \u201csignificantly more\u201d powerful, nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile early Wednesday. Outside governments and analysts concurred it had marked a jump in capability. The ICBM launched early on Wednesday morning was described as the Hwasong-15, with the capability to carry a nuclear warhead and with \u201csignificantly more\u201d power than missiles it\u2019s tested earlier. The missile rose more than 4,000km into space in an almost vertical trajectory and splashed down off the west coast of Japan about 1,000km from where it was fired, reportedly from a mobile launcher. Independent analysts said that with a more normal, flatter trajectory the missile could travel up to 13,000km, putting all of the US mainland in range, though it was unclear how much that reach would be reduced if the missile was carrying a nuclear warhead. Most observers doubted that another set of UN sanctions would stop the North Korean missile and nuclear programmes, but predicted that once the regime felt it had perfected its weapons, it might be ready to talk. \u201cThis confirms that North Korea is hell-bent on advancing their nuclear and missile programmes they believe are essential to their survival,\u201d said Mintaro Oba, a former state department official. \u201cIt looks like they advanced their technology with this launch but there are still questions about re-entry capability for example.\u201d \u201cEven if there are major new sanctions, it will only increase the North Koreans\u2019 resolve to show they are not affected. They will continue to test and increase their capabilities. They want to get to the point of us accepting they have this nuclear weapons programme,\u201d Oba said. \u201cIt\u2019s a poker game that North Korea seems to be winning.\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry said Beijing was \u201cseriously concerned about and opposed to\u201d North Korea\u2019s latest missile test. Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Wednesday that China \u201cstrongly urges\u201d the North to abide by security council resolutions and cease actions that might escalate tensions. Geng told reporters at a daily news briefing that all concerned parties should \u201cact with caution and jointly safeguard regional peace and stability\u201d. China is North Korea\u2019s only significant ally and biggest source of trade and aid, but has backed increasingly harsh UN security council resolutions in hopes of convincing Pyongyang to return to talks. It has called on the North to cease its missile tests and nuclear activities in return for the US and South Korea suspending large-scale military exercises. However, Beijing has rejected measures that could destabilize Kim\u2019s regime and says military force is cannot be an option in dealing with the tensions. South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, spoke to Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, about North Korea\u2019s test and pledged joint efforts to strengthen sanctions and pressure on Pyongyang over its nuclear ambitions. Moon\u2019s office said the leaders agreed during the phone conversation on Wednesday that the threat posed by North Korea\u2019s expanding nuclear programme should no longer be tolerated and vowed to push for stronger measures against the North at an upcoming UN security council meeting. North Korea\u2019s state media say Kim ordered his engineers to launch a new intercontinental ballistic missile with \u201ccourage\u201d a day ahead of the flight test where it demonstrated its reach deep into the US mainland. State television on Wednesday broadcast a photo of Kim\u2019s signed order, where he wrote: \u201cTest launch is approved. Taking place at the daybreak of Nov 29! Fire with courage for the party and country!\u201d The North says Kim gave the order for the launch on Tuesday.",
