    "content": "The identities of the corpses found aboard a capsized fishing boat off the Japan sea coast last month will be forever shrouded in mystery. The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too. Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern. For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast. Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets. They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast. Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201d Most of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants. In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind. But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths. Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance. If they had been found alive we would have done everything we could to help them.\u201d Jiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, believes Kim sent out an order in the summer that more seafood should be provided to the army. \u201cThe problem is that the North Korean fishing industry is no longer run on socialist principles,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe fishermen realised that if they donated their catch to the military they would end up losing money, so they started allowing soldiers to go out and catch their own fish.\u201d That meant bigger hauls, and allowed civilian fishermen to continue earning money for themselves and foreign currency for the regime under Kim\u2019s quasi-capitalist reforms. Ishimaru, who discussed the boat disappearances with contacts by phone in North Korea earlier this week, believes that large numbers of boats carrying soldiers who knew nothing about fishing or navigation left ports in North Korea soon after Kim\u2019s exhortation to increase catches. Typically small, with tiny engines and no GPS navigation instruments or VHF radios, the boats would easily have lost their way in a storm or a strong current and quickly run out of food and fuel. \u201cWhen Kim Jong-un issues an order no one can ignore it, even if he is asking them to do the impossible,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThat means inexperienced soldiers go out to sea, even in terrible conditions and with no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that they are soldiers, so they wear civilian clothes, which is why none of the bodies found in Japan was in uniform.\u201d In Fukui, concern about the arrival of vessels from North Korea is mixed with sympathy for the people who met such wretched ends, in freezing seas many miles from home. \u201cI expect they were ordered to catch fish by the North Korean government, but of course no one there will take any responsibility for what happened to them,\u201d said Mitsumasa Sakashita, a 67-year-old fisherman in Fukui. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, because they were just like us: fishermen trying to make a living from the sea.\u201d",
