    "content": "Ten children aged between four and seven were injured yesterday when a man stormed into a nursery school cafeteria in Seoul and slashed at them with kitchen knives. One of the pupils was in a critical condition and two were seriously hurt after suffering multiple stab wounds. The attacker picked up two knives from a table after entering the room in the Neungdong church in eastern Seoul where 16 children were eating lunch, according to witnesses. He began slashing at the children, who scattered and crawled under the tables. Television footage showed blood spattered over the tables, dishes and floor of the cafeteria. The rampage continued for 30 minutes as staff struggled to restrain the attacker. Police finally apprehended the blood-stained knifeman using tear gas. The 53-year-old man being held said that he launched the attack after hearing voices telling him he must kill people to save his own life, according to police. He has a history of mental illness, a spokesman added. Police identified the suspect only by his last name, Hwang. The man said that Kim Il Sung, the late founder and former president of North Korea, had instructed him to kill people, according to the national news agency Yonhap.",
