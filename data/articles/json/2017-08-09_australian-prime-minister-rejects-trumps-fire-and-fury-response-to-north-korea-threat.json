    "content": "Malcolm Turnbull has rejected the wisdom of US president Donald Trump\u2019s vow to respond to North Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d if it threatens to attack the United States again, warning a conflict would have \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d for the world. Turnbull said the only way to deal with North Korea was with \u201cmaximum economic pressure\u201d and he welcomed \u201cnew and harsh\u201d sanctions imposed by the United Nations security council on the regime. He said Australia would implement the sanctions \u201cand others\u201d, and it was critical that North Korea came to its senses. Bill English, the New Zealand prime minister, went further than Turnbull saying Donald Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cnot helpful\u201d. \u201cI think the comments are not helpful in an environment that is vey tense\u201d he told New Zealand media. On Tuesday Trump warned further North Korean threats would \u201cbe met with fire and the fury like the world has never seen\u201d after Pyongyang threatened \u201cphysical\u201d retaliation for the new sanctions. \u201cA conflict would be shattering. It would have catastrophic consequences. We all understand that,\u201d Turnbull said on Wednesday. \u201cThe global community, led by the security council, including China and Russia, are all united in seeking to bring the maximum economic pressure on North Korea to bring them to their senses without conflict. \u201cThe critical thing is that this dangerous regime comes to its senses. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear about this. The fault in this area, the wrongdoing, is that of the North Korean government. They are the ones who are in breach of UN security council resolutions. They are the ones that are acting illegally. They are the ones that are threatening the peace of the region and the world.\u201d Experts on North Korea have warned that aggressive rhetoric from the Trump administration could backfire, convincing Kim Jong-un that his regime was in imminent jeopardy and triggering what he sees as a pre-emptive attack. \u201cIt is dangerous and reckless and counterproductive for Donald Trump to threaten the annihilation of North Korea,\u201d said Daryl Kimball, the head of the Washington-based Arms Control Association. \u201cWhat we need is a dialogue to reduce tension and avoid catastrophic miscalculation. We are currently on the road to a conflict and we have to get to the off-ramp.\u201d Turnbull on Wednesday reminded China of its unique relationship with North Korea, saying it had power to influence the regime\u2019s behaviour. \u201cWhile every nation should be united in bringing this rogue regime to its senses, we note especially the importance of China\u2019s role as North Korea\u2019s major economic partner, China has unique leverage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we welcome, in particular, China\u2019s support for these strong and much-more harsh sanctions imposed by the security council. \u201cThe regime must come to its senses and stop its illegal provocations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threats to the peace of the region are coming from Pyongyang.\u201d",
