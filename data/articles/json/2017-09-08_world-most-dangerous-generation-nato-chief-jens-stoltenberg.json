    "content": "The world is more dangerous today than it has been in a generation, the head of Nato has said, days before the mobilisation of an estimated 100,000 Russian troops on the EU\u2019s eastern borders, and as a nuclear crisis grows on the Korean peninsula. Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of the military alliance, said the sheer number of converging threats was making the world increasingly perilous. Asked in a Guardian interview whether he had known a more dangerous time in his 30-year career, Stoltenberg said: \u201cIt is more unpredictable, and it\u2019s more difficult because we have so many challenges at the same time. \u201cWe have proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in North Korea, we have terrorists, instability, and we have a more assertive Russia,\u201d Stoltenberg said during a break from visiting British troops stationed in Estonia. \u201cIt is a more dangerous world.\u201d From next Thursday, over six days, Russian and Belarusian troops will take part in what is likely to be Moscow\u2019s largest military exercise since the cold war. An estimated 100,000 soldiers, security personnel and civilian officials, will be active around the Baltic Sea, western Russia, Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, without the supervision required under international agreement. On the other side of the world, in the face of local protests, the South Korean government has deployed the controversial US Thaad missile defence system as it looked to counter potential future attacks from North Korea, which recently launched a ballistic missile over Japan, threatened the US Pacific territory of Guam and tested a possible thermonuclear device. Donald Trump has threatened to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the North Koreans should further threats be made against the US, and kept up the threat on Thursday, saying he is building up US military power. \u201cIt\u2019s been tens of billions of dollars more in investment. And each day new equipment is delivered \u2013 new and beautiful equipment, the best in the world, the best anywhere in the world, by far,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re not going to have to use it on North Korea. If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea.\u201d Trump has ruled out talks with Pyongyang for the time being and Washington\u2019s diplomatic focus is now on efforts to secure agreement at the United Nations for much tighter economic measures, including an oil embargo and possibly a naval blockade. Speaking during his visit to the Estonian military base in Tapa, a former Soviet Union airstrip about 75 miles (120km) from the border with Russia, Stoltenberg was coy when asked if he backed the US president\u2019s bellicose threats to Pyongyang, blamed by some for exacerbating the current situation in south-east Asia. \u201cIf I started to speculate about potential military options I would only add to the uncertainty and difficulty of the situation so I think my task is not to be contribute to that. I will support efforts to find a political, negotiated solution,\u201d he said. Pushed on whether he could even envision a military solution to the crisis in Korea, Stoltenberg said: \u201cI think the important thing now is to look into how we can create a situation where we can find a political solution to the crisis. \u201cAt the same time I fully understand and support the military message that has been implemented in the region by South Korea and to some extent Japan, as they have the right to defend themselves. They have a right to respond when they see these very aggressive actions. I also support the presence of US troops and capabilities in Korea.\u201d Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister whose 10 years in power were marked for his success in improving Norway\u2019s environmental footprint, took over the role of Nato secretary general in 2014, forming a close working relationship with Barack Obama. Soon after Trump\u2019s election last year, however, in response to suggestions that the White House might back away from Nato, Stoltenberg made a pointed intervention highlighting the lives lost by the alliance\u2019s members coming to the aid of the US after the 9/11 attacks. Trump had described Nato as obsolete during his election campaign. In May, Stoltenberg took on the role of placater-in-chief after the US president used the occasion of the opening of Nato\u2019s new building in Brussels, and the unveiling of a memorial to 9/11, to castigate 23 of the 29 Nato members for not spending enough on defence. A number of leaders were visibly startled by the nature and timing of the speech. Asked this week whether Trump was the ideal person to unpick the current fraught security situation, Stoltenberg insisted the 29 Nato members were united within the alliance. \u201cDonald Trump is the elected president of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Nato is a collective alliance of 29 democracies. And that\u2019s part of democracy, that different political leaders are elected.\u201d He said he did not believe there was an imminent threat to Nato members, and that an increase in defence spending had strengthened the alliance in recent years. Stoltenberg has completed a tour of the four battle groups stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, forming the Nato advanced forces defending the eastern borders. Stoltenberg said the troops\u2019 \u201cdefensive\u201d mobilisation was a message to Russia that an attack on one Nato ally was an attack on all, and that he remained confident of the security of eastern Europe. But he expressed concern at Moscow\u2019s imminent failure to live up to its international obligations for exercises involving more than 13,000 troops to be open to observers, including overflights. Some Baltic states estimate that about 100,000 Russian troops will be involved in this year\u2019s exercise and Poland claims the Kremlin has requisitioned more than 4,000 train carriages to move military personnel west. \u201cRussia has said it is below 13,000. They briefed that on the Nato-Russia council a few weeks ago,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cThat was useful but at the same time we have seen when Russia says that an exercise has less than 13,000 troops that\u2019s not always the case. We have seen that in Zapad 2009 and 2013 \u2013 the two previous Zapad exercises. There were many more troops participating.\u201d Stoltenberg said Nato had always offered up its exercises to scrutiny, \u201cwhile Russia has not opened any exercise to open observation since the end of the cold war\u201d.",
