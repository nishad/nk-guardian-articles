    "content": "Veronica Timperley and Alan Goodwin attended the Guardian Live event Understanding North Korea: how likely is war?. It featured as panellistsTania Branigan, Guardian leader writer and former China correspondent; Aidan Foster-Carter, honorary senior research fellow in sociology and modern Korea at Leeds University; James Hoare, former member of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Research Analysts, and the first British representative to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea; and Hazel Smith, author and professor at the Centre of Korean Studies at SOAS. The discussion was chaired by Emma Graham-Harrison, international affairs correspondent for the Guardian and The Observer. \u2018It\u2019s staggering how little is understood about North Korea\u2019 Veronica: We know North Korea has reached a crisis point in terms of its relations with several key countries in the region, but looking at it objectively, there is little consensus on most aspects of its politics. It\u2019s such an incredibly complex situation, and any analysis of the leadership structure is difficult, to say the least. It was helpful to listen to panellists with a range of specialisms, though the inclusion of a US perspective might have illuminated some aspects of the debate. Alan: It\u2019s hard to get a sense of whether the population at large is for or against the regime; to acquire even a surface-level knowledge \u2013 let alone in-depth insight \u2013 of a country with such incredibly tight controls on so many aspects of life. Even those who have spent a significant amount of time there can do little more than observe. It\u2019s so hard to talk to locals, and for them to talk freely to outsiders. So unpicking the political intricacies and anticipating Kim\u2019s next move is a big ask. \u2018It\u2019s an incomparable situation, but giving it some historical context was helpful and fascinating\u2019 Veronica: The historical context is vital, to properly understand what has been tried before. The current situation is reminiscent of the Cuban missile crisis, but these are far more dangerous times \u2013 it appears that North Korea may have successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb about five times more powerful than the devices the US dropped on Japan during the second world war. So these could even be apocalyptic times, and nobody is quite sure of where the limits are for either Trump or Kim. Alan: Listening to the panellists helped me better understand why North Korea might feel so threatened and therefore feel the need to have a strong defence deterrent. This doesn\u2019t get much airtime but is essential for any understanding of the posturing and outcomes. Accepting what is going on and taking that as a starting point for conversations seems to be a good way forward. North Korea has never really done what China asked of it in the past, so it is probably far-fetched to think it will now, but its relationship with the country is still vital. \u2018I felt more optimistic by the end of the evening\u2019 Veronica: The panel seemed to feel there\u2019s still scope for a diplomatic solution. Hazel Smith felt as though the region\u2019s system itself might be cracking and that the surge in entrepreneurial activity in recent years is indicative of the potential for an uprising. Alan: The answer to the question \u201cHow likely is war?\u201d was never going to be a straightforward one but I went home with a better understanding of the factors influencing the region and feeling slightly more optimistic. The consensus from the panel seemed to be that war is definitely possible, but unlikely. And as ever, the importance of talking cannot be underestimated. Veronica, 71, lives in London and is a recently retired art teacher. Alan, 56, is an investment manager from Tunbridge Wells.
