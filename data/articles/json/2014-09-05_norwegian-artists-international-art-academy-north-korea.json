    "content": "Norwegian artists are planning to open an international art academy in North Korea, to allow creatives from inside and outside the isolated state to work together in what organisers believe to be the first scheme of its kind. The DMZ Academy, named after the highly militarised border zone between North and South Korea, is expected to take place in Pyongyang for two weeks August next year. If it is successful, organisers hope to eventually establish a permanent international art school. \u201cWe hope to use the concept of art to challenge preconceptions both inside and outside North Korea,\u201d Morten Traavik, one of the artists behind the project, told the Guardian by phone from Norway. \u201cThere have been a few international photography exhibitions in Pyongyang, but it is the first time that artists from all sides are meeting to exchange ideas and create new works\u201d. North Korean authorities tightly control interactions between ordinary citizens and international visitors, who are usually supervised by minders. Traavik has been to North Korean 10 times and has worked with cultural authorities on four art projects within the country. He and fellow artist Henrik Placht are hoping to find around six creatives from outside the North to attend the academy, which will not only include visual arts but also video, photography, installation, illustration and graphic design, as well as the distinctly North Korean choreography of mass gymnastics at the Arirang games. Like other programmes he has led in the North, Traavik admits this one will be subject to strict limitations on what the artists can express in their works. \u201cExplicit criticism of the leadership is out of the question of course, but I have no problem at all with that,\u201d says Traavik. \u201cIt is a question of respecting the cultural and political norms. There are counterproductive hangups in the western world that all valid interaction with North Korea should involve some kind of human rights lecturing \u2013 I don\u2019t believe in that.\u201d Critics have accused Traavik of working too closely with the authoritarian government in Pyongyang, which is accused of perpetrating grave rights abuses against its people. He rejects claims that he is \u201cnaive or brainwashed\u201d and says he believes that engaging with North Korea is the only way to break through the myths created by \u201cthe government\u2019s propaganda and the world media echo chamber\u201d. \u201cObviously we will not bring artists like Pussy Riot, or Tracey Emin, or Banksy this time... that is too much too soon,\u201d says Traavik. \u201cWhat we will do is select artists who can bring in new ideas, but stop short of being deliberately controversial\u201d. \u201cWe must remember that, like much of the rest of the world, North Korea has had no age of enlightenment when it comes to critical thought. The very notion of contemporary art as as a tool of controversy, it is as though it comes from another planet\u201d. North Korea\u2019s visual art scene is largely limited to the genre of socialist realism. The nation\u2019s 1000 top artists are employed at the celebrated Mansudae Art Studio, which is dedicated to creating patriotic artworks both at home and abroad, and are sold for all-important foreign currency. However, Traavik argues that North Korean artists are \u201cperfectly capable of more than just reproduction\u201d across a variety of genres, especially performance art. \u201cOn one level, North Korean society is so centered on the act of performing \u2013 in both literal and proverbial senses \u2013 that I half-jokingly call the whole country the world\u2019s biggest and longest performance,\u201d he said. Though the creation of a permanent international art school is a long way off, some have already voiced their scepticism about the idea. \u201cThere is an issue related to making sure that the quality of education is just as good as the one we have here in Norway,\u201d Cecilie Broch Knutsen, rector of Oslo\u2019s School of Fine Arts, told Norway\u2019s public broadcaster NRK, in comments translated by artnet news. \u201cIt seems to me that it will be very difficult to achieve in North Korea.\u201d",
