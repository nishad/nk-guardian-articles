    "content": "When Kim Yo-jong, was introduced to the public as a \u201csenior official of the party central committee\u201d in March, analysts speculated that she could one day become North Korea\u2019s most powerful woman. Now, as the country\u2019s leader remains conspicuously absent from public life, it has been suggested that Kim Jong-un\u2019s younger sister may have stepped up to help him manage the daily affairs of leadership while he battles a bout of ill health. Along with Kim\u2019s wife, the former singer Ri Sol-ju, the 27-year-old is one of the country\u2019s most prominent women and has been photographed with her brother on public visits. However, it is her absence from the limelight that some believe adds weight to the theory that she may have taken over some, or even all, of the leadership responsibilities from her brother as he recovers from his \u201cphysical discomfort\u201d. \u201cIf Kim has indeed been set aside \u2013 and nobody outside Pyongyang really knows \u2013 then whoever has taken power is not seeking the limelight,\u201d said John Everard, former UK ambassador to Pyongyang.\u201cThe visits to factories and military units that Kim frequently conducted have not been taken over by anyone else; they have simply stopped.\u201d \u201cAs a woman in a very male-dominated society, the theory goes, she might be reluctant to push herself forward publicly straight away, preferring instead to bide her time while governing from behind the scenes.\u201d However, Everard says though it is \u201cnot impossible\u201d that Kim Yo-jong has stepped up to the leadership, \u201cit is as hard to disprove this theory as it is to find anything to support it\u201d. Kim Yo-jong, whose name is also spelt Kim Yeo-jung, is believed to act as an adviser for her brother, as other members of the Kim family have done relatives did previously for both him and his father, the late leader Kim Jong-il, before him. Her elder sister, Kim Sul-song, for example, held a key role in the party\u2019s powerful propaganda department under their father. Their aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, was similarly influential until she fell out of favour last year after her husband \u2013 Kim\u2019s former mentor \u2013 was executed. She is now believed to be in hiding. In the absence of independent media inside the secretive state, speculation about what lies behind Kim\u2019s absence, and whether he is still in power, continues. \u201cThe young leader\u2019s absence certainly does deepen our questions about how their system might change or operate without him,\u201d said Adam Cathcart, a lecturer in history at Leeds University and editor of North Korea news and analysis website Sino-NK.com. He too expressed doubts that North Korea might have quietly seen a woman take supreme power for the first time. \u201cWithout Kim Jong-un in the forefront, North Korea\u2019s government [remains] a highly conservative patriarchy run by old men for whom Moscow 1956 is the standard for dangerous liberalism. Regardless of who is in charge, it will keep the world on its toes \u2013 one thing that the state does extremely well.\u201d",
