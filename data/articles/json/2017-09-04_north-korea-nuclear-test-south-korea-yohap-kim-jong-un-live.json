    "content": "Here is an excerpt from the article by my colleague Justin McCurry, which rounds up the latest developments on the Korean peninsula. South Korea has carried out a simulated attack on North Korea\u2019s nuclear test site in a huge show of force in response to Pyongyang\u2019s detonation of what it claims is a hydrogen bomb. Seoul has also approved the complete deployment of a US anti-missile system in another sign that it intends to address North Korean provocations with reminders of its own military firepower, while keeping the door open to dialogue. South Korean intelligence officials said there were indications that the North was preparing to test fire another ballistic missile, though they did not say when they believed the launches would take place. The army and air force drills, held at an undisclosed location on Monday morning, involved launching ballistic missiles in a simulated strike against North Korea\u2019s Punggye-ri nuclear test site \u2013 the scene of Sunday\u2019s controlled detonation of what Pyongyang claimed was a powerful hydrogen bomb capable of being loaded on to an intercontinental ballistic missile. We\u2019re going to pause our live coverage now, so I recommend you read that article in full: China\u2019s foreign ministry has rejected Donald Trump\u2019s tweeted threat to stop trading \u201cwith any country doing business with North Korea\u201d as unfair and unacceptable. Asked about Trump\u2019s threat, the foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, told reporters: We cannot accept a situation in which, on the one hand we work to resolve this issue peacefully, but on the other China\u2019s own interests are subjected to sanctions and are damaged. This is neither objective, nor is it fair. Asked about the timing of Sunday\u2019s test - which came just hours before the start of the Brics summit in China - Geng said: Whenever North Korea conducts a nuclear test, it goes against the will of the international community and China will strongly oppose it. Asked about the risk of radioactive material being carried over the border into China, Geng said: The Chinese government attaches high importance to protecting the safety of Chinese citizens and the environment in the [border] region... China will take relevant measures to safeguard Chinese citizens and the environment. And, when asked about military cooperation between the US and South Korea, Geng replied: We hope all the involved parties are able to maintain their restraint and keep calm and can make joint efforts to return to the track of peace talks. We hope the relevant parties will work with China towards the same end. According to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, this is the statement put out by Brics leaders about North Korea this afternoon in China, where the emerging nations\u2019 annual summit is being held: We express deep concern over the ongoing tension and prolonged nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and emphasise that it should only be settled through peaceful means and direct dialogue of all the parties concerned. The Brics countries are Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Some more from the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, who has been trying to ease tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear tests. Speaking to reporters at a summit of the emerging nations, referred to as Brics, he said: Those who are stronger and smarter should show restraint. Any clumsy step could lead to an explosion. International reaction to North Korea\u2019s nuclear test has not been uniform. While the US has talked up a military response, other world powers have emphasised different approaches. Russia has offered perhaps the most direct opposition to Washington\u2019s stance, with the country\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, saying Moscow believes the only way forward is by political and diplomatic means. He sought to tone down the rhetoric, saying the situation in North Korea was not a real nuclear threat to Russia. According to Reuters, he joined China in expressing opposition to the deployment of the US\u2019s Thaad missile defence system in South Korea. Beijing believes it threatens its national security. Russia would respond to such a military buildup on its borders, Ryabkov said, adding that all options were on the table and talks between Moscow and Washington were needed. He made clear that he condemned the North Korean tests and stressed the importance of dialogue with the country. He criticised the US\u2019s willingness to issue sanctions, though he indicated that Russia could yet make a decision to impose the same. China\u2019s foreign ministry said it had lodged \u201csolemn representations\u201d with the North Korean embassy in Beijing. According to Agence France-Presse, the ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: China opposes the DPRK in carrying out nuclear missile development and we are committed to denuclearisation of the peninsula. This position is well-known and the DPRK also knows this position perfectly well. China upheld talks with North Korea, to which Geng Shuang referred by its acronym, as the means to resolve the issue, it was said. The South Korean government has released more details about its decision to complete the deployment of a US missile defence system designed to intercept incoming North Korean missiles. The last four of six terminal high-altitude area defence (Thaad) batteries will become fully operational after the environment ministry on Monday gave its consent to their installation in Seongju, a village in central South Korea where two batteries are already in operation. A defence ministry survey of the site concluded that Thaad\u2019s impact on the surrounding environment and community would be minimal, saying that electromagnetic radiation from the system\u2019s powerful X-band radar and noise pollution would remain below safety levels set by the government. Villagers had protested against Thaad\u2019s initial deployment in April, claiming it would damage their crops and health. The additional deployment, which will reportedly begin later this week, will not be without conditions, however. The ministry requires regular radiation assessments that must be observed by residents, and for the result to be made public, according to the Yonhap news agency. South Korea and the US agreed in 2016 to install the missile defence system to counter the growing threat from North Korean missiles. China has angrily denounced Thaad as a threat to its own national security, while residents of Seongju say the missile batteries, installed on a golf course, have turned their village into a North Korean target. South Korea will temporarily deploy four remaining launchers for a missile defence system after the completion of an environmental assessment by the government, the country\u2019s defence ministry said on Monday. Some construction would be carried out to deploy the launchers for the terminal high-altitude area defence (Thaad) system at a site in Seongju, south of Seoul, according to Reuters. There are currently two launchers at the location, which is a former golf course. The defence ministry did not specify when the launchers would be moved there. The deployment decision was reportedly made by the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in. China strongly objects to the use of the missile defence system, saying its powerful radar can penetrate deep into its territory, undermining its security. The South Korean defence minister, Song Young-moo, has said the country\u2019s president and government officials are in agreement that their response to North Korea\u2019s recent tests should be to strengthen the South Korean military, rather than to hold talks, according to the Reuters news agency. South Korea\u2019s defence ministry is still seeing signs that North Korea plans to stage more ballistic missile launches, possibly including an intercontinental ballistic missile, it said in a parliament hearing on Monday. Chang Kyung-soo, a defence ministry official, said: We have continued to see signs of possibly more ballistic missile launches. We also forecast North Korea could fire an intercontinental ballistic missile. The defence ministry was called by parliament on Monday to answer questions about North Korea\u2019s sixth and largest nuclear test, which was carried out a day earlier. The Yonhap news agency reports that Seoul\u2019s defence ministry also measures North Korea\u2019s nuclear test at 50 kilotons. The detonation on Sunday was the strongest ever from the North, which claimed the test was of a hydrogen bomb. We are going to put this blog on hold for now. Please see our latest wrap of recent developments here and you can look at all of our coverage of the North Korea situation here. South Korea\u2019s military has conducted a show of force, simulating an attack on Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear test site, Punggye-ri, a day after the regime held its sixth and largest nuclear test. It involved live-fire exercises using its Hyunmoo ballistic missiles, F-15K fighter jets and troops on the ground at undisclosed locations on its east coast. It plans more exercises jointly with the US. Seoul is poised to approve further deployments of a controversial US missile defence system. China has said the Thaad system is a threat to its own national security. Many in the South are calling for the country to develop its own nuclear deterrent independent of the US. The United Nations security council is set to hold an emergency meeting on Monday morning. Nations around the world condemned the test. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has pledged to do his utmost to increase the country\u2019s missile defences. He spoke after he and South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, held a 20-minute talk on the phone and agreed to pursue stronger UN sanctions to draw North Korea to the negotiating table. The White House responded to North Korea\u2019s nuclear test with a sharp warning by defense secretary James Mattis that \u201cany threat\u201d against any US territory \u201cor our allies will be met with a massive military response.\u201d China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, did not mention the crisis at the Brics summit today, and Chinese media joined him in downplaying tensions. The Communist party\u2019s official mouthpiece, the People\u2019s Daily, carried just one line on its front page. China is furious, but has few options, experts say. Asked whether the United States would attack North Korea, Donald Trump said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see.\u201d Video here. Trump earlier turned on South Korea, tweeting: \u201cSouth Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!\u201d The test reflects the failure of Trump\u2019s bellicose rhetoric on North Korea, the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger writes. Trump earlier spoke to Shinzo Abe and \u201cconfirmed the two countries\u2019 ironclad mutual defence commitments,\u201d the White House said. Theresa May condemned the test as \u201creckless\u201d, saying it is more pressing than ever to look at increasing the pace of implementing sanctions on the regime. North Korea\u2019s claim that it had tested a hydrogen bomb was not implausible. The test caused an earthquake of magnitude 6.3. Read about the test. If you\u2019re just starting your day now, here is a wrap of the main developments out of South Korea from our Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry. I will also post a summary of the wider situation shortly. Experts and commentators in South Korea have been calling for Seoul to gain its own nuclear deterrent independent of the US, our Hong Kong correspondent, Benjamin Haas, writes. South Korea hosts about 30,000 US troops and falls under the US nuclear umbrella, but in return is banned from building its own nuclear weapons under an agreement struck in 1974. \u201cAs nuclear weapons are being churned out above our heads, we can\u2019t always rely on the US nuclear umbrella and extended deterrence,\u201d the Dong-a Ilbo, South Korea\u2019s second-largest newspaper, said in an editorial. The US stationed atomic weapons in the South after the 1950-53 Korean War, but withdrew them in 1991 when North and South Korea jointly declared they would make the peninsula nuclear-free. The editorial said that agreement no longer applied. \u201cThere is no reason for us to cling onto the declaration when it has come to mean the denuclearisation of South Korea, not the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,\u201d it said. Here is the full read from our Beijing correspondent, Tom Phillips, on the cards Xi Jinping could play to bring North Korea into line. At the Brics summit in Xiamen, south-east China, state media cut off its transmission of world leaders after Xi Jinping had spoken but Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, did get to speak about North Korea on Twitter: He said: \u201cAnother question that concerns us are the recent North Korean tests. Brazil reaffirms its commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.\u201d Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest provocation \u2013 which some believe was deliberately timed to upstage the start of the annual Brics summit in China \u2013 exposes not only the scale of the North Korean challenge now facing Chinese president Xi Jinping but also the dearth of options. \u201cThe Chinese are pissed off, quite frankly,\u201d says Steve Tsang, the head of the Soas China Institute. \u201cBut there is nothing much they will actually do about it. Words? UN statements and all that? Yes. But what can the Chinese actually do?\u201d One option is to further tighten sanctions on Kim\u2019s regime by targeting its exports of textiles and clothing, says Zhao Tong from the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing. Xi could also deprive Kim of another key source of revenue by agreeing to limit or completely prohibit up to 100,000 North Korean labourers from working overseas, including in China. A third and far more drastic option also exists: cutting off North Korea\u2019s crude oil supply. Zhao doubts Xi will choose that path. He believes turning off the taps could prove an irreversible decision since the pipeline delivering oil to North Korea is old and would corrode and break if left unused. Crucially, though, it would cripple North Korea\u2019s economy, almost certainly bring down Kim\u2019s regime and create a massive refugee and security crisis just a few hundred miles from Beijing. The Nikkei is now off nearly 1% as the market takes fright at the higher yen. The rise in the currency makes Japanese goods more expensive abroad, hurting the big electronics and car exporters listed on the stock market. However, the reaction of the markets is reasonably calm given the rapid escalation in tensions over recent weeks. One explanation came from Rob Carnell, head of Asian research for ING, who even saw an upside for investors. \u201cLike a bad horror movie, the North Korea saga intersperses moments of calm, with occasional action to jolt you out of your chair. \u201cBut we have been here now many, many times. Unless this is the precursor to US military action, which we doubt, then in a little over a day or two, tensions will calm again, making this a good buying opportunity for investors with a strong enough nerve.\u201d Xi Jinping has finished speaking at the opening of the Brics summit proper and made no mention of North Korea\u2019s nuclear test and the ensuing turmoil. Our Beijing correspondent, Tom Phillips, wrote earlier that Xi had hoped to further boost his image as an international statesman by hosting this week\u2019s Brics summit, an event that has now been upstaged by Kim Jong-un. China\u2019s front pages on Monday joined the president in downplaying the tensions, seeking instead to focus on the issues facing a summit. The Communist party\u2019s official mouthpiece, the People\u2019s Daily, carried just one line about the crisis, beneath a photograph of Xi welcoming Russian president Vladimir Putin. More detail from Justin McCurry on Shinzo Abe\u2019s phone call with Moon Jae-in. Abe told Moon that Sunday\u2019s nuclear test was \u201ca head-on challenge to the international community\u201d, Kyodo news agency quoted the Japanese deputy chief cabinet secretary, Yasutoshi Nishimura, as saying. Abe said the international community should bring the \u201cstrongest possible pressure\u201d to bear on Pyongyang, including additional sanctions, and that Japan would urge China and Russia to do more. In turn, Moon said South Korea would work with the security council, and vowed to maintain a strong bilateral security alliance with the US. His comments came after Donald Trump chastised South Korea for pursuing \u201cappeasement\u201d towards the North, although Moon has consistently supported the use of military and economic pressure, while leaving the door open to talks. Abe\u2019s pledge to improve its defences is in keeping with its plans specifically to acquire more PAC-3 Patriot missile batteries. It rolled some examples out this month in Tokyo for a planned drill. Last year Reuters reported Japan was seeking to upgrade its defences in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in case of North Korean aggression. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has told a coalition party room meeting that the country would do its utmost to increase its missile defence capabilities and, alongside the US, defend itself against North Korean aggression. He spoke after he and South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, held a 20-minute talk on the phone and agreed to pursue stronger UN sanctions to draw North Korea to the negotiating table. Presidential Blue House spokesman Park Su-hyun told a media briefing: \u201cBoth heads of state agreed to cooperate closely with each other and the United States and shared the understanding there must be the most powerful sanctions and pressure applied on North Korea.\u201d South Korea\u2019s military has released more images it says are from its earlier live-fire exercise. The operation focused on simulated targets in the East Sea and the military said the sites were chosen with the North\u2019s Punggye-ri nuclear test site in mind. South Korea\u2019s media has called on Seoul to consider developing an independent nuclear deterrent, as concern grows over the strength of Washington\u2019s commitment to its east Asian ally\u2019s security following North Korea\u2019s sixth nuclear test on Sunday. The South hosts 28,500 US troops and falls under the US nuclear umbrella, but in return is banned from building its own nuclear weapons under a 1974 agreement with the US. North Korean missile launches and yesterday\u2019s test of what it claimed was a powerful hydrogen bomb have triggered calls by conservative politicians for the South to develop a nuclear deterrent independent of the US. Support for the move is also rising among South Korean voters. \u201cAs nuclear weapons are being churned out above our heads, we can\u2019t always rely on the US nuclear umbrella and extended deterrence,\u201d the mass-circulation Dong-a Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial on Monday. The US stationed atomic weapons in the South after the 1950-53 Korean War, but withdrew them in 1991 when North and South Korea jointly declared they would make the peninsula nuclear-free. The editorial said that agreement no longer applied. \u201cThere is no reason for us to cling onto the declaration when it has come to mean the denuclearisation of South Korea, not the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,\u201d it said. Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean president Moon Jae-in have held telephone talks in which they have agreed greater pressure is needed on North Korea, including stronger United Nations resolutions. An emergency meeting of the security council has been called for 10am, according to US ambassador Nikki Haley. South Korea has said it is preparing to conduct fresh military drills alongside US forces. This is in addition to the ballistic missile tests and fighter jet drills it has already conducted today. We will publish more details on this when we have them. South Korea is poised to approve further deployments of a controversial US missile defence system, a day after North Korea claimed it had successfully tested a powerful hydrogen bomb capable of being loaded on to a long-range missile. South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, had initially opposed the Thaad (terminal high-altitude area defense) system but appears to have softened his stance in light of North Korea\u2019s tests. Seoul\u2019s military also conducted live-fire exercises involving its Hyunmoo ballistic missiles and F-15K fighter jets. China says the Thaad system is a threat to its own national security. The United Nations security council has called a meeting for Monday. Nations around the world condemned the test. The White House responded to North Korea\u2019s nuclear test with a sharp warning by defense secretary James Mattis that \u201cany threat\u201d against any US territory \u201cor our allies will be met with a massive military response.\u201d Chinese media have downplayed the North Korea tensions, with the Communist party\u2019s official mouthpiece, the People\u2019s Daily, carrying just one line on its front page about the crisis, beneath a photograph of Xi welcoming Russian president Vladimir Putin to China for the Brics summit. Asked whether the United States would attack North Korea, Donald Trump said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see.\u201d Video here. Trump turned on ally South Korea, tweeting: \u201cSouth Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!\u201d The test reflects the failure of Trump\u2019s bellicose rhetoric on North Korea, the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger writes. Welcoming Bric-member nations to a summit, Chinese president Xi Jinping did not mention North Korea but said \u201cincessant conflicts in some parts of the world and hotspot issues are posing challenges to world peace\u201d. Trump spoke with Japanese premier Shinzo Abe and \u201cconfirmed the two countries\u2019 ironclad mutual defense commitments,\u201d the White House said. Theresa May condemned the test as \u201creckless\u201d, saying it is more pressing than ever to look at increasing the pace of implementing sanctions on the regime. North Korea\u2019s claim that it had tested a hydrogen bomb was not implausible. The test caused an earthquake of magnitude 6.3. Read about the test. Japan\u2019s foreign minister, Taro Kono, and the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, will push for fresh sanctions against North Korea when the UN security council meets later on Monday to discuss its response to Sunday\u2019s nuclear test. In a phone call on Monday morning Japan time, Kono and Tillerson agreed the international community should intensify pressure on Pyongyang, according to Kyodo news. Options under consideration by US and Japanese officials include restricting the flow of oil into North Korea \u2013 a contentious measure that would have serious and immediate repercussions for the North Korean economy, given its dependence on energy imports. China, which along with Russia is a major supplier of oil to North Korea, is cautious about strangling the state\u2019s energy supply, fearing a domestic implosion could lead to a huge influx of refugees and the presence of US and South Korean troops along its border. Now that there are convincing signs Pyongyang has reached the stage where it can miniaturise a thermonuclear warhead, it is likely to be too late for a credible military option, write our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, and Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry. Any attempt at a preventative attack on North Korea would probably trigger a cataclysmic response against US allies, US bases and possibly the US homeland itself. \u201cThe military options are all bad,\u201d Michael Hayden, the former director of the NSA and CIA, told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019re not zero. We have got them \u2013 but none of them are good.\u201d He added: \u201cThis may be the time now to really hammer home that we are deadly serious on your performance, China, on sanctions.\u201d Abraham Denmark, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence for east Asia, said: \u201cThis may be a moment of clarity for China. Supporting stronger sanctions, even cutting off oil and labor, is a real possibility. \u201cChina will see a sixth nuke test just before their Party Congress, and despite Chinese warnings, as a slap in the face to Beijing.\u201d You can read the full analysis here: Here is a video of the full statement made by US defence secretary James Mattis earlier outside the White House. In it he says America\u2019s commitment to its allies is \u201cironclad\u201d and that any threat \u201cwill be met with a massive military response, both effective and overwhelming\u201d. South Korea\u2019s military has released images of its live-fire exercises, held at undisclosed locations on Monday in response to the North\u2019s nuclear test. It involved Hyunmoo ballistic missiles and F-15K fighter jets as well as troop movements on the ground. The exercises, along with the conditional approval for a US missile defence system, appear to be further evidence of President Moon Jae-in\u2019s departure from the route of diplomacy. One of the Thaad missile defence batteries that was deployed on a golf course in the South Korean county of Seongju in April this year. South Korea is poised to give its consent to further deployments of a controversial US missile defence system, a day after North Korea claimed it had successfully tested a powerful hydrogen bomb capable of being loaded on to a long-range missile. The first two terminal high-altitude area defense (Thaad) anti-missile batteries went operational, amid widespread opposition, in the central village of Seongju in late April, but the deployment of a further four batteries was suspended pending the outcome of an environmental impact assessment. On Monday morning, Yonhap news agency said the environment ministry had given its \u201cconditional consent\u201d to the installation of additional Thaad batteries, but gave no further details. South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, had initially opposed Thaad\u2019s introduction, which had been agreed to by his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye. But he appears to have softened his stance in light of North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear tests, and a dramatic rise in tensions on the peninsula since he took office in May. The new launchers will also be deployed in Seongju, about 300km south of Seoul. Each Thaad battery comprises six launchers and a radar system. China has angrily opposed Thaad deployments, saying the system\u2019s powerful radar could be used to spy on its own missile programme and so represents a threat to its national security. South Korea\u2019s finance minister said on Monday he would take \u201cdecisive and immediate market-stabilising measures\u201d to protect against economic turmoil in the wake of the North\u2019s nuclear test, news agency Yonhap has reported. Kim Dong-yeon met the Bank of Korea\u2019s governor, Lee Ju-yeol, and the chairman of the Financial Services Commission, Choi Jong-ku. Afterwards, he said: \u201cThe North Korean issue is spreading across the world. It may not only have a short-term impact on the financial and foreign exchange markets, but on the real economy as a whole.\u201d \u201cIf we detect anything wrong, such as market turbulence, we will take decisive and immediate market-stabilising measures in accordance with our contingency plan,\u201d he added. The benchmark Kospi (Korea composite stock price index) started 40.8 points, or 1.73%, lower at 2,316.89 points at 9am, with the Korean won losing ground at 1,129 won against the US dollar. Investors have turned to safe havens such as the yen and gold this morning when the financial markets opened for the first time since news of North Korea\u2019s nuclear test. The Japanese currency jumped to \u00a5109.875 to the US dollar as investors bet on Japan \u2013 the world\u2019s largest creditor nation \u2013 calling in funds in time of crisis and pushing up the yen. The yen\u2019s rise was bad news for Japanese stocks, however, and the Nikkei dropped 0.6% in early trade. The ASX200 in Sydney was down 0.3%. Gold hit a 10-month high to stand at $1,335.90. Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in Sydney said: \u201cThe White House and Pyongyang are once again strumming taut investor nerves. The announcement of a [claimed] hydrogen bomb test and retaliatory threats from the US are depressing market sentiment in early morning trading. The news hits markets as participants prepare for a data-heavy week.\u201d There\u2019s relatively little on the front pages of China\u2019s state-run newspapers this morning about Sunday\u2019s nuclear test. Chinese president Xi Jinping is hosting the annual Brics summit in south-east China and Beijing\u2019s propaganda chiefs are determined not to allow Kim Jong-un to steal the spotlight. The Communist party\u2019s official mouthpiece, the People\u2019s Daily, has just one line about the crisis, beneath a photograph of Xi welcoming Russian president Vladimir Putin to China yesterday. Its report says the pair agreed to \u201cappropriately deal\u201d with the situation and to maintain \u201cclose communication and coordination\u201d. The English-language China Daily, an international mouthpiece for China\u2019s government, has more to say. In an editorial, the newspaper says North Korea\u2019s latest test \u201cindicates it has taken a big step in its pursuit of nuclear prowess\u201d. \u201cThe latest development \u2026 if true, may indeed give Pyongyang the means to carry out its threats of launching doomsday attacks on enemy targets. Given Pyongyang\u2019s readiness to put to use each and every of its newly acquired capabilities against perceived enemies, this is a particularly dangerous move in its tactic of using nuclear and missile tests to draw attention to its demands,\u201d the China Daily argues. Closing following Beijing\u2019s official line, the newspaper says it is now time to return to the negotiating table with North Korea. \u201cSunday\u2019s test will obviously not be its last show of defiance ... [The international community must now consider] Pyongyang\u2019s genuine needs, especially food and national security.\u201d The sun rises over the Friendship bridge, which connects the North Korean town of Sinuiju with the Chinese border city of Dandong. A key threat made by Trump in the wake of the North Korea\u2019s six and biggest nuclear test was the halting of trade with countries that trade with isolated state. That threat is not being seen as credible, write our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, and Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry: In 2016, the US imported $463bn worth of goods from China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trade partner. Cutting off trade with Beijing would trigger a protectionist spiral that would create a global recession. Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, said he would begin drafting a new package of sanctions. A previous round had targeted mostly Chinese companies that did business with North Korea. \u201cWe\u2019ve already started with sanctions against North Korea but I am going to draft a sanctions package to send to the president for his strong consideration,\u201d Mnuchin told Fox News. However, former officials and analysts said that much would depend on how China now reacted. Beijing had repeatedly warned the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, not to carry out another nuclear test. You can read the full analysis here: Here is the readout arising from Trump\u2019s phone call with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe yesterday, in which he reaffirms a commitment to defend US allies \u201cusing the full range of diplomatic, conventional and nuclear capabilities\u201d. There is some talk today of how many times Trump has spoken to Abe as opposed to South Korean president Moon Jae-in, whom the US president criticised for his \u201ctalk of appeasement\u201d. It is worth noting that, after the previous missile test from North Korea, Trump and South Korean president Moon Jae-in held a phone call on enhancing Seoul\u2019s own missile capabilities. KoreaJoongAng Daily reports that a spokesman for the Blue House (the South Korean president\u2019s official residence) said the two agreed \u201cin principle\u201d on the need to improve its missile defences. Present guideline prohibit South Korea from developing ballistic missiles with a range of over 800km (497 miles) and a payload exceeding 500kg (1,102lb). Seoul is seeking to revise it, reportedly with an aim to double the warhead weight limit, the newspaper reports. Xi Jinping takes Russian president Vladimir Putin on a tour of China\u2019s cultural heritage on Sunday. The Brics summit provides an opportunity for the two world leaders with close links to North Korea to discuss how to tackle Pyongyang. South Korea\u2019s Monday newspapers are dominated by news of the nuclear test, with varying degrees of scepticism about the claim that a hydrogen bomb was tested. English-language dailies, such as Korea JoongAng Daily, Korea Herald and Korea Times, focus on the claim of a hydrogen bomb. The Korean dailies say the nuclear test crossed a \u201cred line\u201d and appear to accept the hydrogen bomb claim. The business dailies focus on fears Donald Trump might scrap the free trade agreement with South Korea. He is to speak to his advisers about the deal this week. South Korea\u2019s military has said it conducted live-fire exercises involving its Hyunmoo ballistic missile and F-15K fighter jets in response to the North\u2019s nuclear test. News agency Yonhap reported the surface-to-surface missile and the F-15K\u2019s long-range air-to-ground missile hit targets in the East Sea. The South\u2019s military said the distance to the simulated targets was set in consideration of the North\u2019s Punggye-ri nuclear test site. The annual Brics summit continues today following an opening address from China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, yesterday in which he referred to a \u201cdark shadow\u201d across the world that threatens peace. He told the three-day summit in Xiamen, south-eastern China: \u201cThe intertwined threats of terrorism and a lack of cybersecurity \u2013 among others \u2013 have cast a dark shadow over the world. People around the world want peace and cooperation, not conflict or confrontation.\u201d Hi address came hours after news broke of North Korea\u2019s nuclear test. Read the full report from our Beijing correspondent, Tom Phillips, here: Here is a fuller take on Prime Minister Turnbull\u2019s recent comments. He said the Korean peninsula was \u201ccloser to war than at any time\u201d since the Korean War. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull has said China is best placed to pressure the North Korean regime to come to the negotiating table. Doing the media rounds on Monday morning before parliament returned from a winter break, Turnbull said: \u201cThe Chinese are frustrated and dismayed by North Korea\u2019s conduct, but China has the greatest leverage, and with the greatest leverage comes the greatest responsibility.\u201d \u201cRight at that moment, Kim Jong-un has chosen to affront China, to defy China, and this calls for a strong Chinese response.\u201d However, he noted the \u201ccruel and evil dictatorship\u201d was not a puppet state of China. The Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, returned to the issue of cutting oil supplies to North Korea, saying it would be unprecedented and would have a significant impact. \u201cWe have to bring unprecedented pressure to bear because North Korea will have to pay a significant price for this latest nuclear test,\u201d she told the Seven Network on Monday. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: The White House responded to North Korea\u2019s biggest nuclear test to date with a sharp warning delivered by defense secretary James Mattis outside the White House. \u201cBecause we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea, but as I said we have many options to do so,\u201d Mattis said. Mattis said \u201cany threat\u201d against any US territory \u201cor our allies will be met with a massive military response.\u201d Transcript Asked whether the United States would attack North Korea, Donald Trump said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see.\u201d Video Trump turned on ally South Korea, tweeting: \u201cSouth Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!\u201d The test reflects the failure of Trump\u2019s bellicose rhetoric on North Korea, the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger writes. Welcoming BRIC-member nations to a summit, Chinese president Xi Jinping did not mention North Korea but said \u201cincessant conflicts in some parts of the world and hotspot issues are posing challenges to world peace.\u201d The United Nations security council called a meeting for Monday. Nations around the world condemned the test. Trump spoke with Japanese premier Shinzo Abe and \u201cconfirmed the two countries\u2019 ironclad mutual defense commitments,\u201d the White House said. Theresa May condemned the test as \u201creckless\u201d, saying it is more pressing than ever to look at increasing the pace of implementing sanctions on the regime. North Korea\u2019s claim that it had tested a hydrogen bomb was not implausible. The test caused an earthquake of magnitude 6.3. Read about the test. During a broadcast on North Korea\u2019s state news agency KNCA, Pyongyang claimed it was close to developing a nuclear warhead capable of being fitted on to an intercontinental ballistic missile. The Guardian view on North Korea: keep calm and carry on. The UN Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting after North Korea conducted its most powerful nuclear test to date, the Associated Press reports: The U.S., Japan, France, Britain and South Korea requested Monday\u2019s meeting after North Korea detonated what it called a hydrogen bomb. It will be the Security Council\u2019s second urgent session in under a week on the North\u2019s weapons tests, which have continued in the face of a series of sanctions. After North Korea launched a ballistic missile over Japan, the council Tuesday strongly condemned the test and reiterated demands that Pyongyang halt its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. Monday could bring additional condemnation and discussion of other potential steps. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Sunday\u2019s nuclear test. His spokesman calls it \u201cprofoundly destabilizing for regional security.\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, says he supports efforts to \u201cmaximize pressure against the North Korean regime\u201d: North Korea\u2019s threatening actions today are a sober reminder that all nations, including China, must do everything in their power to stop and reverse Pyongyang\u2019s growing nuclear and missile programs. We cannot live in a world held hostage by Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear blackmail, and I support U.S.-led international efforts to maximize pressure against the North Korean regime and its foreign enablers. Here\u2019s a rundown of countries Trump might have been talking about when he threatened to stop all trade with countries \u201cdoing business with North Korea\u201d: (h/t: @bencjacobs) Some reaction to the decision to have the defense secretary and a general make the North Korea statement: This from a former Obama deputy national security adviser: Here\u2019s Trump a month ago laying out the administration\u2019s North Korea policy: We\u2019ll handle North Korea. We\u2019re going to be able to handle North \u2013 it will be uh, it will be handled. We handle everything. Thank you very much. (h/t @bencjacobs) Here\u2019s a transcript of the statement by defense secretary James Mattis, with video at bottom: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. We had a small-group national security meeting today with the president and the vice-president about the latest provocation on the Korean peninsula. We have many military options and the president wanted to be briefed on each one of them. We made clear that we have the ability to defend ourselves and our allies, South Korea and Japan, from any attack and our commitments among the allies are iron-clad. Any threat to the United States or its territories including Guam, or our allies, will be met with a massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming. Kim Jong-un should take heed of the United Nations security council\u2019s unified voice, all members unanimously agreed on the threat North Korea poses, and they remain unanimous in their commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Because we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea, but as I said we have many options to do so. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Defense Secretary James Mattis warned North Korea that the United States has \u201cmany\u201d military options Trump could use to deal with its nuclear arms and long-range missile programs, Mattis told reporters outside the White House. Here\u2019s more from the press pool report: Standing outside the West Wing after a \u201csmall group\u201d meeting with Trump, Mattis said any major threat to the United States or its allies would be met with a \u201cmassive\u201d military response that would be \u201coverwhelming.\u201d But, he said, the Trump administration is not looking for the \u201cannihilation\u201d of any country, including North Korea. Mattis was flanked by Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford. The duo did not respond to several shouted questions, including whether war with North Korea is now inevitable. Defense secretary James Mattis has spoken outside the White House. \u201cWe are not looking for the annihilation of North Korea, we have many options,\u201d he says. He also said that \u201cany threat to the United States or its territories including Guam or our allies will be met with a massive military response.\u201d Here\u2019s video: The White House has advised the press pool to assemble outside the West Wing for a statement. It\u2019s not known who will deliver the statement. Donald Trump huddled with his national security advisers on Sunday to try to decide on a response to North Korea\u2019s sixth and most powerful nuclear test. Pyongyang said it had detonated a hydrogen bomb, using nuclear fusion as well as fission, and the seismic data suggested a blast that was ten times as big as any of its previous tests. Before meeting his advisors, Trump was asked if he was considering a military response. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he replied. However, his initial responses on Twitter suggested the key aspect of the US reaction would be a call on China and other trading partners to tighten the economic vice on North Korea. \u201cThe United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,\u201d Trump tweeted. The threat was not seen as credible. In 2016, the US imported $463bn worth of goods from China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trade partner. Cutting off trade with Beijing would trigger a protectionist spiral that would create a global recession. Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, said he would begin drafting a new package of sanctions. A previous round had targeted mostly Chinese companies that did business with North Korea. \u201cWe\u2019ve already started with sanctions against North Korea but I am going to draft a sanctions package to send to the president for his strong consideration,\u201d Mnuchin told Fox News. Read further: The president of the European Commission says North Korea\u2019s latest nuclear test compels the international community to unite in swift and decisive reaction, the Associated Press reports: Donald Tusk said the European Union stands ready to sharpen its policy of sanctions and invites North Korea to restart dialogue on its nuclear and missile programs without condition. In Sunday\u2019s statement, Tusk said the EU calls on the U.N. Security Council \u201cto adopt further U.N. sanctions and show stronger resolve to achieve a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\u201d adding, \u201cThe stakes are getting too high.\u201d He said North Korea must abandon its nuclear weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in a verifiable and irreversible manner and it must cease all related activities at once. Turkey has strongly condemned the latest North Korean nuclear test, the Associated Press reports: In a statement published Sunday, Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry said the test was \u201cirresponsible and provocative,\u201d while ignoring international law and endangering regional peace and security. Turkish troops were part of a United Nations command aiding South Korea during the Korean War between 1950 and 1953. More than 700 soldiers died in the battles. Thanks to @bencjacobs for sending along reactions to the North Korea test from senators as they come in. Here\u2019s a roundup: Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona: \u201cwe see the limits of economic sanctions\u201d Well, what we have been doing over the years has certainly not slowed the advance of their nuclear program, but I don\u2019t think that harsh rhetoric does either. I think that they\u2019re moving. Certainly, sanctions are -- are not, you know, arresting that development either. So just about nothing we have done so far has helped slow it down. They seem intent on moving forward. Obviously, we hope that China exercises its leverage. They have considerably more leverage than we do. But I think, given where they are, we see the limits of economic sanctions obviously on North Korea. Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska: Kim \u201cmust be confronted\u201d If North Korea has in fact successfully tested a nuclear warhead that can be loaded onto an intercontinental ballistic missile, Kim Jong-un is clearly threatening the American people. He must be confronted. The United States, our allies and partners, and those who are still enabling Pyongyang must confront and change Kim Jong-un\u2019s calculus of terror. Diplomatically if we can. Militarily if we must. Adam Schiff, Democrat of California: \u201cbellicose tweets are not productive\u201d I think these erratic and often bellicose tweets are not productive, and could be counterproductive with a regime like North Korea that already fears we\u2019re going to invade and have imperialist ambitions. So I don\u2019t think that makes much sense, and it could also cause them to miscalculate in a way that could really escalate things. I think a far better approach, frankly, is to look at the lessons in how we dealt with Iran, and how we dealt with the Soviet Union, in terms of either getting a cessation or roll back of their nuclear programs. There are some good templates for us to use, but none of them involve the fiery kind of rhetoric that is more appropriate for Pyongyang than Washington. Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware: \u201cconsult closely with Congress\u201d I urge President Trump to consult closely with Congress, to rely on his national security and diplomatic team and to continue working with the UN and China to increase pressure on North Korea through tougher sanctions, while also strengthening our defensive anti-missile capabilities. It is urgent that we speed up deployment and development of systems that can defend our homeland and our vital allies South Korea and Japan. Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana: \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d North Korea\u2019s provocative tests are a threat to the U.S. and the entire global community. I reiterate my urgent call that North Korea\u2019s unacceptable actions be met by a comprehensive U.S. strategy that involves our allies from around the world. It is also long past time for China to step up to seriously and credibly confront the North Korean threat, a topic I will be pressing this week as the Senate Banking Committee examines sanctions enforcement on both North Korea and China. From a just-published editorial: The worst possible outcome of the crisis in the Korean peninsula would be a nuclear war. The second worst would be a conventional one. From these simple platitudes everything else follows. The North Korean regime is undoubtedly vile. Its bombs are unnecessary and bought at the cost of great human suffering. The long-term goal of any foreign policy must be to await and, so far as possible, to hasten the end of the dictatorship. But military intervention is no longer a credible option. It could be argued that it never was. The US military seems to have believed since at least 1995 that any war on the Korean peninsula would result in unacceptable casualties and costs. In that case one of the ironies of the present situation is that North Korea has proved, by building one, that it never actually needed a nuclear deterrent. The threat that its conventional artillery and army posed to the South Korean capital, Seoul, where 10 million people live in their range, was enough to preserve the country from a possible attack. Unhappily, it is in the nature of paranoid autocrats like the Kim dynasty never to be satisfied with the security they have and always to want more. But that is water under the bridge now. To talk of nuclear weapons in rational terms of deterrence and the balance of force is always slightly misleading... Read further: India, Pakistan and the Philippines are among many Asian nations condemning North Korea\u2019s nuclear test, the Associated Press reports: Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter S. Cayetano, in Seoul for an official visit Sunday, said his country is \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the detonation and added, \u201cSuch provocative actions undermine regional peace and stability.\u201d Cayetano says the Association of Southeast Asian Nations is ready to help in any effort to ease the tensions through dialogue. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement deploring Sunday\u2019s blast. It says the North \u201conce again acted in violation of its international commitments.\u201d Pakistan\u2019s condemnation of the test also urged all sides \u201cto display utmost restraint and return toward the path of peaceful negotiated settlement of the issue.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken by telephone with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe and urged restraint in responding to North Korea\u2019s claim to have set off a hydrogen bomb test, the Associated Press reports: Putin, in China for a meeting of leaders of the BRICS economic bloc, called Abe on Sunday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists that Putin \u201csaid the international community could not give in to emotions, should act calmly and deliberately, and stressed that the complex settlement of the nuclear and other problems of the Korean Peninsula can be achieved exclusively through political and diplomatic means.\u201d North Korea\u2019s nuclear test created tremors around the world. Shockwaves were first picked up at a seismic station 230 miles away in Mudanjiang, China, where the needle sprang into action less than a minute after the blast. Seconds later, the tremors reached instruments in South Korea and Japan, and within 12 minutes had been detected in Canada, Australia and at the Eskdalemuir Observatory in Scotland. More than 130 stations recorded shockwaves, which after 20 minutes had reached as far as Argentina 12,000 miles from the test site. Based on the strength of the tremors, equivalent to a magnitude 6.3 earthquake, according to the US Geological Survey, nuclear weapons specialists put the yield of the bomb at about 100 kilotons. That is roughly 10 times more powerful than previous nuclear bombs tested by the North Koreans, including what was claimed to be another hydrogen bomb at the same Punggye-ri facility in January 2016. Analysts have been sceptical that the 2016 test involved a hydrogen bomb because the energy released was comparatively small, but the latest test leaves less room for doubt, according to Anne Str\u00f8mmen Lycke at Norsar, the Norwegian centre responsible for detecting nuclear tests. \u201cFrom the seismic signal alone it\u2019s not possible to tell the difference between a conventional atomic explosion and a hydrogen bomb, but when it\u2019s as large as this one, the credibility of the claim that it\u2019s an H-bomb increases dramatically,\u201d she said. Hydrogen bombs can be a lot more powerful than conventional atomic bombs. In conventional atomic bombs, the blast is produced by atoms being ripped in two. But the fission process is inefficient and the bombs tend to be big and heavy. H-bombs instead fuse hydrogen atoms together to create heavier elements, a process that releases far more energy. Read further: Trump seems to threaten a shutdown of US trade with China: In 2016, the United States imported $463bn worth of goods from China, more than from anywhere else, according to the US trade representative. Experts believe an end to that trading relationship would have devastating repercussions for the US economy, but it doesn\u2019t take an expert to see how. American homes are filled with Chinese-made goods, most likely including components of whatever computer or TV hardware you are reading this on. If the price of those goods leapt by half... Trump announces a meeting about North Korea. Thank you. Here\u2019s video of the \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d moment: Donald Trump responded to North Korea\u2019s sixth nuclear test by turning on one of Washington\u2019s closest allies in the region, South Korea, blaming it on Seoul\u2019s policy of \u201cappeasement\u201d. Pyongyang\u2019s rhetoric and actions leading up to the test have been aimed at the US, however, and detonation of the most powerful nuclear device the regime has built so far reflects the failure of any remaining hope Trump might have had that his own bellicose rhetoric would work as a deterrent. Since the US president\u2019s warning that \u201cfire and fury\u201d would befall North Korea if it continued to threaten the US, Kim Jong-un has unveiled a detailed plan to fire a salvo of missile at the US Pacific of Guam, conducted its most provocative ballistic missile test to date, flying it over Japan territory, and carried out its most ambitious nuclear test, of what it claims is a thermonuclear device. Initial estimates suggest it may have been a two-stage bomb perhaps ten times more powerful than the biggest of the earlier tests. Trump\u2019s response in a series of Sunday morning tweets was to lash out at China, saying North Korea had become a \u201cgreat threat and embarrassment\u201d to Beijing, but more strikingly at the South Korean government of Moon Jae-in. \u201cSouth Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!\u201d Trump tweeted. Moon, who was elected in May, has cautioned against threatening a pre-emptive attack against North Korea and insisted that South Korea, which would almost certainly bear the brunt of a response, would have to be consulted before major military action. Read further: As he left a prayer service moments ago, Trump was asked whether he will attack North Korea, Reuters reports. Trump\u2019s reply: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d North Korea\u2019s neighbors are looking for radiation from its nuclear test, but they might not find any, the Associated Press reports: The North said the underground test site where it detonated what it described as a hydrogen bomb did not leak radioactive materials. If that\u2019s true, it will be difficult for outsiders to determine whether the device was indeed a thermonuclear weapon or a simpler nuclear bomb. Japan\u2019s Nuclear Regulation Authority says no abnormal change in radiation levels had been detected on monitoring posts across the country as of Sunday night. China\u2019s National Nuclear Safety Administration says it activated nuclear radiation-related environmental contingency plans shortly after the test was conducted. It said in a statement on its website that automatic environmental radiation monitoring stations in China\u2019s northeast were operating normally. Senator Ted Cruz, speaking with ABC News from the scene of flooding damage in Texas, says \u201cthe president speaks in ways that I wouldn\u2019t speak\u201d on North Korea \u201cbut that is his prerogative\u201d: Separately, NBC News cites unnamed government experts who have been analyzing the North Korean test. Technical experts are working to confirm the details, NBC reports, \u201cbut there is no reason to doubt it was a test of an advance nuclear device. Remaining variables include whether it was hydrogen as claimed.\u201d Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the foreign relations committee, has released a statement calling for a \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d on North Korea that \u201cplaces an emphasis on deterrence\u201d. Tweet from Corker\u2019s communications director: Trump\u2019s tweet of Sunday morning taking a swipe at South Korea \u2013 \u201cSouth Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!\u201d the president wrote \u2013 is breaking news in South Korea, notes the Tokyo bureau chief of the Washington Post: Donald Trump\u2019s public response to North Korea\u2019s test so far has been limited to three tweets calling North Korea a \u201cgreat threat\u201d and lecturing South Korea about \u201cappeasement.\u201d The White House says Trump is meeting with national security advisers later today. This morning, Donald and Melania Trump are attending a church service for a National Day of Prayer declared for those impacted by hurricane Harvey, CNN reports. Barack Obama included some words about the United States\u2019 \u201cindispensible\u201d role in world affairs in an Inauguration Day letter for Trump, advising that \u201cit\u2019s up to us\u201d to \u201csustain the international order.\u201d The text of the 275-word letter has emerged for the first time this morning. CNN obtained a copy, which reads in part: Second, American leadership in this world really is indispensable. It\u2019s up to us, through action and example, to sustain the international order that\u2019s expanded steadily since the end of the Cold War, and upon which our own wealth and safety depend. Steven Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s treasury secretary and a member of his national security council, has said that he wants to cut off North Korea\u2019s economy because of the test. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this behavior is completely unacceptable,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cWe have already started with sanctions but I\u2019m going to draft a sanctions package that I\u2019m going to send to the president for his strong consideration, that anybody that wants to do trade or business with them [North Korea] would be prevented from doing trade or business with us. People need to cut off North Korea, economically.\u201d When asked if the US would take a much tougher stance with Chinese financial institutions and companies in that regard, Mnuchin said: \u201cWe are going to strongly consider everything at this point.\u201d He refused to comment on \u201cclassified things\u201d such as whether the test was a hydrogen bomb, not just an atomic bomb, and whether the US believed that North Korea had now miniaturized its nuclear capability to the point where it could put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile. \u201cI can only say that the intelligence community has been doing an amazing job,\u201d he said. He said he had spoken to Trump about the issue that morning, but refused to clarify what the president meant when he said North Korea only understood \u201cone thing\u201d, or comment on the prospect of military action. \u201cThe president has made it clear this is not the time for just talk, this is the time for action,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cOur objective will continue to be to de-nuclearize the peninsula \u2026 He will consider everything but we are not going to broadcast our actions. My focus right now is on additional economic sanctions. China has a lot of trade with them, there is a lot we can do to cut them off economically.\u201d Texas Representative Joaquin Castro, who sits on the House foreign affairs committee, notes in an interview with ABC News that hundreds of thousands of Americans in South Korea and Japan \u201cwould be in harm\u2019s way\u201d in case of military action in the region. Almost 30,000 US troops are stationed on the Korean peninsula. Read further: This is Tom McCarthy in New York \u2013 I\u2019ll be continuing to update you on the latest news from North Korea throughout the morning. Theresa May has condemned the latest nuclear test by North Korea as \u201creckless\u201d, saying it is more pressing than ever to look at increasing the pace of implementing sanctions on the regime, writes the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Elgot: The prime minister said the test, North Korea\u2019s sixth since 2006, \u201cposes an unacceptable further threat to the international community.\u201d May reiterated the call she made with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe during her trip to Japan last week for tougher action against Kim Jong-un. \u201cI discussed the serious and grave threat these dangerous and illegal actions present with President Abe in Japan this week and reiterate the call we jointly made for tougher action, including increasing the pace of implementation of existing sanctions and looking urgently in the UN Security Council at new measures,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is now even more pressing. The international community has universally condemned this test and must come together to continue to increase the pressure on North Korea\u2019s leaders to stop their destabilising actions.\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has issued a statement saying Donald Trump will meet with his national security team later today to discuss the North Korean nuclear test. Here is the short statement in full: The national security team is monitoring this closely. The president and his national security team will have a meeting to discuss further later today. We will provide updates as necessary. Boris Johnson has warned there \u201cno easy military solution\u201d to preventing North Korea escalating its nuclear aggression but said all options were still on the table for retaliation after the regime\u2019s nuclear weapons test. The foreign secretary said it was not clear how a military response from the West would be possible, given the proximity of the South Korean capital, Seoul, to the North Korean border. Any military challenge to Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime could come at huge cost to civilian lives in South Korea, Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly our view that none of the military options are good,\u201d he told reporters after North Korea announced it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to an intercontinental ballistic missile \u201cIt is of course right to say that all options are on the table, but we really don\u2019t see an easy military solution,\u201d he said. Were the west to hit back with force against North Korea, \u201cthey could basically vapourise\u201d large parts of the population even with conventional weapons, Johnson warned. \u201cSo that\u2019s not really very easy to threaten and to deliver,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch more productive we think is to continue with the international diplomatic effort.\u201d Anna Fifield, the Tokyo bureau chief for Washington Post, has tweeted the front page of Rodong Sinmun, a North Korean newspaper. The headline, she says, reads: \u201cRespected supreme leader comrade Kim Jong-un directs the nuclear weapons project.\u201d A dark shadow is looming over the world after more than half a century of peace, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has said after North Korea\u2019s sixth nuclear test. Xi made no direct reference to Sunday morning\u2019s detonation as he addressed an annual summit of the Brics nations but told his audience that only through dialogue, consultation and negotiation could \u201cthe flame of war be put out\u201d. \u201cThanks to the joint effort of all countries, global peace has reigned for more than half a century. However, incessant conflicts in some parts of the world and hotspot issues are posing challenges to world peace,\u201d Xi said in his 40-minute address to a summit between Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa in south-east China. \u201cThe intertwined threats of terrorism and a lack of cybersecurity \u2013 among others \u2013 have cast a dark shadow over the world. People around the world want peace and cooperation, not conflict or confrontation.\u201d More on that story here: In South Korea, residents are continuing as normal despite the actions of their unpredictable neighbour. Yeon Park, from Gimhae in southern South Korea, says no one really cares as it\u2019s happened before. He told the Guardian: To be honest, not many South Koreans realise the reality [of the situation] including myself. What North Korea is doing is on air everyday on the news, but I don\u2019t think people here care about it a lot. Even I don\u2019t really care about it as this kind of news has occurred many times. Hyunhee Kim also said she wasn\u2019t paying much attention: I know it is an emergency. But this happens often and the end is always quiet and nothing happened. So I do not worry about it again. News comes from multiple channels, but I do not pay much attention. I don\u2019t know how things are going, but I do not think there will be anything particularly bad this time again. Elliot Morris, an English teacher from the UK who has lived in South Korea since 2010, also isn\u2019t too worried. He said: I don\u2019t feel too anxious or concerned at the moment. I normally take the policy of seeing how my Korean colleagues and friends react to these bits of news from the North. It seems like business as usual today. I stopped getting worried about these things a few years ago. However, I\u2019m probably keeping a closer eye on it at the moment as there has been an uptick in the Northern Korean chest beating of late. James Newman, another English teacher from the UK who lives in Busan, said Donald Trump is the main concern among South Korean friends and colleagues. The Western media seem to be more worried with the situation [than they are here]. I guess it\u2019s because South Korea is so used to this strong rhetoric and has had a history of threats against them. The only game changer is that I spoken to a few nervous individuals that are more concerned about the unpredictability of President Trump. As far as I\u2019m concerned it\u2019s business as usual. In China, The Global Times, a nationalist, Communist party-run tabloid that sometimes reflects Beijing\u2019s way of thinking, has put out this English-language editorial. \u201cThis is another wrong choice that Pyongyang has made in violation of UN security council resolutions and the will of the international community. This test will result in a new round of escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and heighten the risk of the situation spiralling out of control due to possible miscalculations by all sides,\u201d the newspaper warns. \u201cCurrently, the most important thing for China is to make sure that we are able to detect if a nuclear leak occurs, to allow us to inform people living in the north-eastern China to take the appropriate safety measures.\u201d Japan\u2019s prime minister has said North Korea\u2019s nuclear test is \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d and said its nuclear and missile programmes pose a \u201cmore grave and urgent\u201d threat to his country. \u201cThe fact that North Korea forced through a nuclear test this time is absolutely unacceptable to our country,\u201d Shinzo Abe said in a statement. The statement continued: North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile development programme is a threat that is more grave and urgent to the safety of our country and has entered a new stage. It is significantly hurting regional and international peace and stability. Our country lodge a strict protest against North Korea and condemns it in the strongest words. John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, wrote an analysis earlier today on what needs to happen next to calm the situation down. Donald Trump has a very big part to play, he said. The test does not fundamentally change the situation on the Korean peninsula, though it is another acceleration. What is still missing is diplomacy. It is up to the Trump administration whether they want to flip this into an opportunity to belatedly start talking directly to Pyongyang, or just continue down the beaten track of shows of force, more UN sanctions, and secondary sanctions. The United Nations nuclear watchdog said the test was \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d and called North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme a \u201cgrave concern\u201d. Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said: Today\u2019s nuclear test by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is an extremely regrettable act ... Once again, I strongly urge the to fully implement all relevant resolutions. The agency continues to closely follow developments in the DPRK*s nuclear programme, which is a matter of grave concern. North Korea said the test was a successful detonation of an advanced hydrogen bomb rather than a standard nuclear fission device. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBT), which monitors seismic and radionuclide data worldwide, said the explosion was stronger than previous blasts and was located at the site of earlier nuclear tests. The CTBT bans all nuclear explosions but it will only enter into force if all countries with advanced nuclear technology ratify it. The outstanding nations are China, Egypt, North Korea, India, Iran, Israel, Pakistan and the US. Lassina Zerbo, the CTBT\u2019s secretary general, said: If confirmed as a nuclear test, this act would indicate that the DPRK\u2019s nuclear programme is advancing rapidly. I sincerely hope that this will serve as the final wake-up call to the international community to outlaw all nuclear testing by bringing the CTBT into force. For background reading, my colleague P\u00e1draig Collins has put together this timeline of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon development. The apparent nuclear test today is the sixth test that North Korea is thought to have carried out since 2006. According to South Korean authorities, the test was about 11 times stronger than North Korea\u2019s test in January last year and up to six times stronger than its test last September. The Russian foreign ministry said on Sunday it was deeply concerned about a reported nuclear test by North Korea. The ministry said it regretted that the leadership of North Korea was \u201ccreating a serious threat\u201d for the region and warned that \u201cthe continuation of such a line is fraught with serious consequences\u201d for Pyongyang. The statement on the ministry\u2019s website said: This latest demonstrative disregard by Pyongyang of the requirements of the relevant resolutions of the UN security council and the norms of international law deserves the strongest condemnation. In the unfolding conditions, it is imperative to remain calm and to refrain from any actions that lead to a further escalation of tension. We call on all interested parties to immediately return to dialogue and negotiations as the only possible way for an overall settlement of the problems of the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, released a statement that said the international community, including the UN security council, on which the country sits, should react quickly and firmly to North Korea\u2019s latest nuclear test. The President of the Republic calls on the members of the United Nations security council to quickly react to this new violation by North Korea of international law. The international community must treat this new provocation with the utmost firmness, in order to bring North Korea back unconditionally to the path of dialogue and to proceed to the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear and ballistic programme. During an emergency call between US national security adviser HR McMaster and his Japanese counterpart, McMaster said Washington was firmly committed to defending Japan, including with its nuclear deterrent, following North Korea\u2019s latest nuclear test. The security official made the assurance during a telephone call to Shotarou Taniuchi, the director-general of the Japanese national security council, according to a Japanese government statement. Under Japan\u2019s alliance treaty with the US, Washington has pledged to defend Japan. It has put Japan under its nuclear umbrella, meaning it could respond to any attack on Japan with atomic weapons. China\u2019s nuclear safety administration said it had begun emergency monitoring for radiation along the border after North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test. The test was widely felt in north-east China and rocked some cities for as long as eight seconds, according to reports and accounts on social media. It was felt as far away as the city of Changchun, about 250 miles (400km north-west of North Korea\u2019s test site at Punggye-ri, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Witnesses in the Chinese city of Yanji, which borders North Korea, said they felt a tremor that lasted several seconds. Some people said they ran out of their homes in fear. Michael Spavor, director of the Paektu Cultural Exchange, told Reuters: I was eating brunch just over the border here in Yanji when we felt the whole building shake. It lasted for about five seconds. The city air raid sirens started going off. One person wrote on Chinese microblog Weibo: I put my underpants on and I just ran, and when I reached the first floor I can say I wasn\u2019t the only one running away with just my underpants on. Another, as reported by AFP said: I was lying down and sleeping when the tremor woke me up. At first, I thought it was a dream. Guam homeland security and the office of civil defence has released a statement via its Facebook page seeking to reassure citizens. The statement said the situation was being closely monitored by security chiefs. There are no known immediate threats assessed for Guam and the Marianas at this time. The threat level remains the same. Guam, a sovereign US territory in the western Pacific Ocean, is used by the US as a strategic military base. The small remote island is within range of North Korean medium- and long-range missiles and in August was threatened by North Korea. Pyongyang said at the time it was \u201ccarefully examining\u201d a plan to strike Guam, located 3,400km (2,100 miles) away, and threatened to create an \u201cenveloping fire\u201d around the territory. The nuclear test will create maximum embarrassment for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, experts have said. Xi was only hours from opening the summit of the BRICS nations \u2013 the association of five major emerging national economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 when news of the test emerged. Eva Dou of the Wall Street Journal tweeted that the opening speech had been upstaged by North Korea\u2019s actions. However, Stephen McDonell of the BBC, said that the president had not mentioned the nuclear test. South Korea said North Korea\u2019s defiant sixth nuclear test should be met with the \u201cstrongest possible\u201d response, including new UN security council sanctions to \u201ccompletely isolate\u201d the country. Seoul and Washington also discussed deploying US strategic military assets to the Korean peninsula after North Korea defied international warnings and conducted its most powerful nuclear test yet on Sunday, South Korea\u2019s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, said in a news briefing. China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs has just released a statement saying it \u201cresolutely opposes\u201d and \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the nuclear test, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency. The statement says: The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has once again conducted a nuclear test in spite of widespread opposition from the international community. The Chinese government resolutely opposes and strongly condemns it. For those who can read Chinese, the full statement is here. My colleague Justin McCurry in Tokyo has the full story on this morning\u2019s news that North Korea seems to have carried out its sixth nuclear test. Here\u2019s some background from that article: Sunday\u2019s test \u2013 the first since Trump took office in January \u2013 offers more evidence that North Korea is moving perilously close to developing a nuclear warhead capable of being fitted on to an intercontinental ballistic missile [ICBM] that can strike the US mainland. Since it conducted its first nuclear test just over a decade ago, the regime has strived to refine the bombs\u2019 design and reliability, as well as increasing their yield. As the US and countries in the region analysed data resulting from the quake, Japan\u2019s government was the first to state publicly that it was confident the shockwaves came from an underground nuclear explosion in North Korea. Top security officials from the US and South Korea have spoken following North Korea\u2019s apparent sixth nuclear test, South Korea\u2019s presidential office has said. US national security adviser HR McMaster spoke with his counterpart, Chung Eui-yong in Seoul, for 20 minutes in an emergency phone call about an hour after the detonation, the office said. This is Nicola Slawson and I\u2019ll be continuing to update you on the latest news from North Korea throughout the morning. Here\u2019s the full text of the statement from North Korea on its hydrogen bomb test, which Jonathan Cheng of the Wall Street Journal has posted on Twitter: Melissa Davey signing off from Melbourne and handing this live blog over to my UK colleague Nicola Slawson. Thanks for following the latest developments with us \u2013 here\u2019s what we know so far: North Korea claims to have successfully carried out a hydrogen bomb test. According to South Korean authorities, the test was about 11 times stronger than North Korea\u2019s test in January last year and up to six times stronger than its test last September. During a broadcast on North Korea\u2019s state news agency KNCA, Pyongyang claims it is close to developing a nuclear warhead capable of being fitted on to an intercontinental ballistic missile. South Korea\u2019s joint chiefs of staff say they detected a seismic wave from 12.34-12.36pm around Punggyeri, North Korea, while China\u2019s Earthquake Administration said it detected a 6.3-magnitude earthquake in North Korea that was a \u201csuspected explosion\u201d. A second quake in North Korea of magnitude 4.6 suspected to be a second explosion was more likely to be a structural collapse, news reports say, likely caused by the first explosion. More to come ... It sounds like the second tremor reported, initially thought to be another nuclear test, was a structural collapse in the aftermath of the first explosion,possibly a tunnel collapse, reports say. North Korea has said it successfully conducted a test of a hydrogen bomb that can be loaded on to a intercontinental ballistic missile, Yonhap News in South Korea reports. North Korea\u2019s state-run TV broadcaster said that Pyongyang carried out the sixth nuclear test in a special announcement hours after an artificial earthquake was detected near its nuclear test site. An artificial earthquake with a 5.7 magnitude was detected at 12:29pm near North Korea\u2019s nuclear site in the north-eastern area. The Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, has written a wrap of the latest developments in North Korea: North Korea has carried out a nuclear test in a direct challenge to Donald Trump, hours after it released images of what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb that will be loaded on to a new intercontinental ballistic missile. The regime confirmed it had conducted its sixth underground test, which was heralded by a magnitude 6.3 magnitude earthquake felt in Yanji, China, about 10km from North Korea\u2019s Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the country\u2019s north-east, according to South Korea\u2019s meteorological agency. The shockwaves were at least 10 times as powerful as the last time Pyongyang exploded an atomic bomb a year ago, Japan\u2019s meteorological agency said. The previous nuclear blast in North Korea is estimated by experts to have been about 10 kilotons. Sunday\u2019s test \u2013 the first since Donald Trump took office in January \u2013 offers more evidence that North Korea is moving perilously close to developing a nuclear warhead capable of being fitted on to an intercontinental ballistic missile that can strike the US mainland. You can read McCurry\u2019s full report here. According to South Korean news agency Yonhap: South Korea has contradicted a news report that there was a second earthquake near North Korea\u2019s nuclear test site, according to AP News. The Korea Meteorological Administration said it had not detected another quake. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news service reported a second earthquake had happened eight minutes after the first, citing China\u2019s earthquake agency. Tremors caused by the suspected nuclear test were at least 10 times as powerful as the last time Pyongyang exploded an atomic bomb a year ago, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said on Sunday. The previous nuclear blast in North Korea is estimated by experts to have been about 10 kilotons. The US president has postured and threatened while Kim Jong-un has simply ploughed on building a nuclear warhead and a missile that can carry it, writes John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul: The test does not fundamentally change the situation on the Korean peninsula, thought it is another acceleration. What is still missing is diplomacy. It is up to the Trump administration whether they want to flip this into an opportunity to belatedly start talking directly to Pyongyang, or just continue down the beaten track of shows of force, more UN sanctions, and secondary sanctions. More of the same stuff that has been done for the last eight years. Read Delury\u2019s full analysis for the Guardian here. South Korean news agency Yonhap News has just filed this report: North Korea\u2019s apparent sixth nuclear test was estimated to have a yield of up to 100 kilotons, about four to five times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan in 1945, the chief of the parliament\u2019s defence committee said on Sunday. Citing a report from the military authorities, Kim Young-woo said that the explosive power of the apparent nuke tested Sunday appeared to be much stronger than the North\u2019s fifth one, estimated to have a yield of 10 kilotons. One kiloton is equivalent to 1,000 tons of TNT. \u201c(The North\u2019s latest test) is estimated to have a yield of up to 100 kilotons, though it is a provisional report,\u201d Kim of the minor opposition Bareun party told Yonhap News Agency over the phone. \u201cThe test will be a very crucial political and strategic inflexion point.\u201d Kim also pointed out the need for the Moon Jae-in administration to make a decision over whether to stick to its peace initiative that seeks to re-engage with the belligerent state through both sanctions and dialogue. Earlier in the day, the South\u2019s weather agency detected a magnitude 5.7 earthquake from the North\u2019s Pyunggye-ri nuclear test site in a sign of another strategic provocation. South Korean intelligence authorities have said that Pyongyang appears ready for another nuke test. Pyongyang carried out nuke experiments in 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2016. Veteran foreign correspondent and North Korea expert Jean Lee is well worth following on Twitter for updates. According to the Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, an update from North Korea is expected in less than an hour. North Korea will make an announcement later on Sunday, according to South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. The regime is set to make a \u201cspecial and important\u201d announcement at 3pm Pyongyang time, the North\u2019s state-run TV broadcaster said, but did not provide further details. Wang Zhen from the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau has been speaking to people near the border. \u201cI was having lunch in a restaurant when the lights just started shaking,\u201d Zhang Zhiyuan, a journalist for the Chinese newspaper Yanji News, who lives and works near China\u2019s border with North Korea, told Zhen. \u201cPeople here have all run outside of their apartments.\u201d John Delury is an associate professor of chinese studies and North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul in South Korea. He says the sixth nuclear test was \u201cwidely expected\u201d. In fact, he predicted as such one day ago: An earthquake of magnitude 5.6 was recorded inside North Korea, hours after the regime boasted it had built a new, more advanced nuclear warhead. South Korea\u2019s joint chiefs of staff say they detected a seismic wave from 12.34-12.36pm around Punggyeri, North Korea. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency quotes military officials as saying they believe North Korea has conducted its sixth nuclear test. China\u2019s Earthquake Administration said it detected a 6.3-magnitude earthquake in North Korea that was a \u201csuspected explosion\u201d. The same body said it detected another quake in North Korea of magnitude 4.6, which it termed as a \u201ccollapse\u201d. A statement from the administration\u2019s said the second quake, measured at a depth of zero kilometres, came eight minutes after the first quake, which it said was a \u201csuspected explosion\u201d. Witnesses in the Chinese city of Yanji, on the border with North Korea, said they felt a tremor that lasted roughly 10 seconds, followed by an aftershock. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, says \u201cIf North Korea has indeed gone ahead with a nuclear test, it is completely unacceptable and we must lodge a strong protest.\u201d The Japanese government shortly after determines that North Korea has conducted its sixth nuclear test, the country\u2019s foreign minister, Taro Kono said. The Japanese government has determined North Korea on Sunday conducted its sixth nuclear test, the country\u2019s foreign minister, Taro Kono said, according to Kyodo news. At a doorstop in Sydney, Australia, the deputy Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, has called conflict on the Korean peninsula \u201cthe greatest threat to peace and stability in our region\u201d. \u201cIt is absolutely vital that we continue to see pressure from the international community to support peace and de-escalation of conflict on the Korean peninsula. Right across our region governments have been watching North Korea\u2019s actions with a great deal of concern and trepidation.\u201d Asked about North Korea\u2019s claim it is capable of fitting a hydrogen bomb to an intercontinental ballistic missile, Plibersek said it was \u201cvery difficult to know how much of the North Korean regime\u2019s propaganda is true\u201d and said that reports differed on the likelihood of that claim being true. \u201cWhat we know for certain is that the North Korean regime is behaving irresponsibly, aggressively and in a way that threatens peace and security in our region ... [and] that the people most likely to influence with the North Korean regime is China and we continue to urge China to do all it can to urge the North Korean regime to stand down.\u201d For those just joining us, it appears North Korea has just launched its biggest nuclear test to date at a test site in the north-east of the country. The suspected test comes hours after leader Kim Jong-un said his country had developed an advanced hydrogen bomb. The Guardian has just posted this backgrounder on how we got to this point: Shinz\u014d Abe, the prime minister of Japan, is responding to news of the suspected test Japan\u2019s government said it would lodge a \u201cstrong protest\u201d if the nuclear test was confirmed. \u201cIf North Korea has indeed gone ahead with a nuclear test, it is completely unacceptable and we must lodge a strong protest,\u201d Abe told reporters on Sunday. The US president, Donald Trump, had just spoken with Abe on Saturday. According to a statement from the White House: \u201cThe two leaders reaffirmed the importance of close cooperation between the United States, Japan, and South Korea in the face of the growing threat from North Korea\u201d. North Korea earthquake points to largest nuclear test Here\u2019s where the explosion occurred, based on information from the United States Geological Survey: NK locator map Reuters has filed this take on the latest developments: A shallow, 6.3-magnitude earthquake shook North Korea on Sunday, suggesting it had detonated a sixth nuclear device, hours after it said it had developed an advanced hydrogen bomb that possesses \u201cgreat destructive power\u201d. The earthquake struck 75 km (45 miles) north/north-west of Kimchaek. Previous recent tremors in the region have been caused by nuclear tests, which if the case this time round, is bound to increase the tension hours after US president Donald Trump and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe talked by phone about the \u201cescalating\u201d nuclear crisis. The quake was only 10 km deep, the US Geological Survey said, again suggesting a nuclear device. Eight minutes later, China\u2019s Earthquake Administration said it has detected another quake in North Korea of magnitude 4.6, which it termed as a \u201ccollapse\u201d and a \u201csuspected explosion\u201d. The coordinates of the two quakes were almost identical, according to figures provided by the administration. Witnesses in the Chinese city of Yanji, on the border with North Korea, said they felt a tremor that lasted roughly 10 seconds, followed by an aftershock. The hydrogen bomb report by North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency comes amid heightened regional tension following Pyongyang\u2019s two tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in July that potentially could fly about 10,000km (6,200 miles), putting many parts of the mainland United States within range. Under third-generation leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea has been pursuing a nuclear device small and light enough to fit on a long-range ballistic missile, without affecting its range and making it capable of surviving re-entry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. North Korea, which carries out its nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of UN security council resolutions and sanctions, \u201crecently succeeded\u201d in making a more advanced hydrogen bomb that will be loaded on to an ICBM, KCNA said. \u201cThe H-bomb, the explosive power of which is adjustable from tens kiloton to hundreds kiloton, is a multi-functional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack according to strategic goals,\u201d KCNA said. \u201cAll components of the H-bomb were homemade and all the processes ... were put on the Juche basis, thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants,\u201d KCNA quoted Kim as saying. Juche is North Korea\u2019s homegrown ideology of self-reliance that is a mix of Marxism and extreme nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the current leader\u2019s grandfather. It says its weapons programmes are needed to counter US aggression. North Korea offered no evidence for its latest claim, and Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University*s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, was sceptical. \u201cReferring to tens to hundreds of kilotons, it doesn*t appear to be talking about a fully fledged H-bomb. It\u2019s more likely a boosted nuclear device,\u201d Kim said, referring to an atomic bomb which uses some hydrogen isotopes to boost explosive yield. A hydrogen bomb can achieve thousands of kilotons of explosive yield \u2013 massively more powerful than some 10 to 15 kilotons that North Korea*s last nuclear test in September was estimated to have produced, similar to the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945. According to Reuters in China, China\u2019s Earthquake Administration said it has detected another quake in North Korea of magnitude 4.6, which it termed as a \u201ccollapse\u201d. A statement on the administration\u2019s website said the second quake, measured at a depth of zero kilometres, came eight minutes after the first quake, which it said was a \u201csuspected explosion\u201d. The coordinates of the two quakes were almost identical, according to figures provided by the administration. China\u2019s Earthquake Administration said on Sunday it detected a 6.3 magnitude earthquake in North Korea that was a \u201csuspected explosion\u201d. The administration said in a statement on its website that the quake, which occurred around 11:30 a.m. (0330 GMT), was recorded at a depth of zero kilometres. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency is quoting military officials as saying they believe North Korea has conducted its sixth nuclear test. M 6.3 Explosion \u2013 24km ENE of Sungjibaegam, North Korea \u2013 Possible explosion, located near the site where North Korea has detonated nuclear explosions in the past. If this event was an explosion, the USGS National Earthquake Information Center cannot determine its type, whether nuclear or any other possible type South Korea\u2019s joint chiefs of staff say a magnitude-5.6 quake in North Korea was artificial and it\u2019s analyzing whether the North conducted a nuclear test. It says it detected a seismic wave from 12:34-12:36pm around Punggyeri, North Korea. The quake came just hours after North Korea claimed that its leader has inspected the loading of a hydrogen bomb into a new intercontinental ballistic missile. An update from the US Geological Survey: Possible explosion, located near the site where North Korea has detonated nuclear explosions in the past. If this event was an explosion, the USGS National Earthquake Information Center cannot determine its type, whether nuclear or any other possible type. An earthquake of magnitude 5.6 has been recorded inside North Korea, hours after the regime boasted it had built a new, more advanced nuclear warhead. The epicentre of the quake was considered shallow at 10km underground, according to the US Geological Survey. Previous similar earthquakes in North Korea have come from nuclear tests, which the country conducts underground. No official confirmation has come, but the situation is obviously tense with recent North Korean missile tests and heated exchanges with Donald Trump and neighbours Japan and South Korea. We will have more updates as they become available.",
