    "content": "Donald Trump flew to Singapore on Saturday for the most momentous meeting of his presidency, a \u201cone-time shot\u201d summit with North Korea. He left behind a trail of confusion and frustration among traditional US allies. The president departed a summit of the G7 major industrialised democracies in Quebec the same way he arrived, firing off threats of a trade war. His fellow leaders were warned not to respond to the steel and aluminum tariffs he has imposed on them. \u201cIf they retaliate, they\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d Trump told reporters before leaving several hours early, ducking sessions on climate change and the oceans. Trump later upped the ante with tweets saying he had asked US representatives not to endorse the joint communique put out by the G7 leaders because of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s \u201cfalse statements\u201d to reporters. Trump tweeted that Trudeau\u2019s remarks at a news conference, where he said Canada would not be pushed around, \u201cwere very dishonest and weak\u201d. \u201cPM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, \u2018US Tariffs were kind of insulting\u2019 and he \u2018will not be pushed around.\u2019 Very dishonest &amp; weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!\u201d the US president tweeted. In a tense session on trade on Friday, European and Canadian leaders had sought to defuse the gathering conflict, rolling out statistics on how many US jobs depended on their countries\u2019 trade and investment and arguing that the US had more barriers to trade than its partners. The discussion had no effect on Trump, who stuck to the claims he made throughout his election campaign: that the US was being ripped off. \u201cThe European Union is brutal to the United States,\u201d he railed. \u201cAnd they understand that. They know it. When I\u2019m telling them, they\u2019re smiling at me. You know, it\u2019s like the gig is up.\u201d Canada too, the president said, \u201ccan\u2019t believe it got away\u201d with its trade deal with the US. \u201cWe\u2019re like the piggy bank that everybody\u2019s robbing. And that ends,\u201d Trump said. The president even threatened to stop doing business with US partners if they did not change their policies. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to stop,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOr we\u2019ll stop trading with them. And that\u2019s a very profitable answer, if we have to do it.\u201d The disparaging tone towards leaders seen by all former administrations as America\u2019s closest allies was in marked contrast to the hopeful language he used in anticipation of Tuesday\u2019s planned summit with Kim Jong-un. It will be the first meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. Its outcome could determine whether the regime in Pyongyang can be persuaded to dismantle the nuclear arsenal it has assembled over three decades. Trump said Kim had a historic opportunity to bring his country out of isolation. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-time shot and I think it\u2019s going to work out very well,\u201d he said, predicting Kim \u201cis going to surprise on the upside\u201d. Trump claimed he would be able to tell quickly if the North Korean leader was serious about dismantling his nuclear and missile programmes and would walk away if Kim was not. \u201cHow long will it take to figure out if they\u2019re serious? \u2026 Maybe in the first minute. You know, the way they say you know if you\u2019re going to like somebody in the first five seconds, you ever hear that one? I think very quickly I\u2019ll know whether or not something good is going to happen. And if I think it won\u2019t happen, I\u2019m not going to waste my time. I don\u2019t want to waste his time.\u201d Asked how he would read Kim so swiftly, Trump said: \u201cMy touch, my feel, that\u2019s what I do.\u201d The juxtaposition of the two high-profile international events has highlighted one of the peculiarities of Trump\u2019s relations with foreign governments: he has found it easier to cultivate personal chemistry with autocrats than with democratically elected leaders. \u201cHe\u2019d much prefer to be in Singapore than in Quebec,\u201d said Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the US and Europe at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe gets more annoyed with allies than enemies, and really doesn\u2019t get on with the others at the G7. He is anti-free trade and allies, and pro-strongmen and authoritarian regimes.\u201d The longer Trump has been in office, Wright said, the more confident he has grown in his own gut instincts, formed by long experience of the property market, which he viewed as a zero-sum struggle to come out a winner, not a sucker. \u201cHe is fixated on trade deficits in particular industries like cars and manufacturing,\u201d Wright said. \u201cBut the whole global economic model is based on the US consuming goods. This is why it is impossible to negotiate with him. He is fixated on something that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Trump has made it clear he sees alliances in the same way, relationships in which the US pays out more than it receives. As the US does not have extensive economic relations with its enemies, in the president\u2019s view, they cannot take advantage of Americans in the same way. Since March, when Kim signaled he was ready to meet Trump, the US president has pivoted from insults and abuse to flattery aimed at the dictator, whom he has referred to as \u201chonourable\u201d. Trump has shown himself ready to shower compliments on Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia, to an extent none of his predecessors would have dreamed of. The president shocked his G7 partners by repeatedly pushing for Russia to be readmitted, four years after Moscow was suspended for its covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. \u201cI would rather see Russia in the G8 as opposed to the G7,\u201d Trump said. \u201c I would say that the G8 is a more meaningful group than the G7, absolutely.\u201d The Canadian and European leaders in Quebec \u2013 with the exception of the new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte \u2013 swiftly dismissed the suggestion as a non-starter, pointing out that Putin had neither done nor said anything to reverse the actions that got Russia kicked out in 2014.",
