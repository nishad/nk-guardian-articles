    "content": "Donald Trump has vowed to respond to North Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d if it makes any more threats to attack the United States. Trump\u2019s comments came after Pyongyang threatened \u201cphysical\u201d retaliation for new United Nations sanctions \u2013 and on a day when fresh evidence emerged that the North Koreans have overcome one of the last major technical obstacles to being able to hit the US or western Europe with nuclear-armed missiles. \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,\u201d Trump told journalists at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey. \u201cThey will be met with fire and the fury like the world has never seen.\u201d Experts on North Korea have warned that aggressive rhetoric could backfire on Trump, convincing Kim Jong-un that his regime is in imminent jeopardy and triggering what he sees as a pre-emptive attack. \u201cIt is dangerous and reckless and counterproductive for Donald Trump to threaten the annihilation of North Korea,\u201d said Daryl Kimball, the head of the Washington-based Arms Control Association. \u201cWhat we need is a dialogue to reduce tension and avoid catastrophic miscalculation. We are currently on the road to a conflict and we have to get to the off-ramp.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying and I\u2019ve long ago given up trying to interpret what he says,\u201d the Republican senator John McCain told an Arizona radio station. \u201cThat kind of rhetoric, I\u2019m not sure how it helps.\u201d The North Korean regime quickly responded, matching Trump\u2019s bellicosity by saying it was \u201ccarefully examining\u201d a plan for a missile strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam. In a separate statement, a military official was quoted as saying Pyongyang could carry out a pre-emptive operation if the US showed signs of \u201cprovocation\u201d. US intelligence agencies now believe, it was reported on Tuesday, the Pyongyang regime has succeeded in building a nuclear weapon small enough to put on an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) \u2013 a conclusion supported by a Japanese government study. The US assessment also estimated the North Korean nuclear arsenal had reached as much as 60 warheads, substantially more than earlier assessments. After two ICBM tests in July, some weapons experts also believe North Korea has passed another hurdle, building a re-entry vehicle (RV) that can deliver a nuclear warhead through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so that it explodes on its target. \u201cI don\u2019t have the slightest doubt that the RVs on these missiles are working,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia nonproliferation programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u201cThat\u2019s done. We\u2019re there. North Korea can put a nuclear weapon on New York City.\u201d Other experts are more guarded about the North Korean capabilities, based on the July tests, stressing for example that it is unclear whether the guidance and control issues have been resolved. As the missiles were tested with much steeper trajectories than would be used in an attack, and because the weight of a warhead is hard to predict, it is hard to estimate the potential maximum range of the weapons. But there is general agreement that if Pyongyang is not already a full nuclear-weapons power, it is advancing rapidly towards that goal. Before taking office, Trump vowed that North Korea would not develop an ICBM during his presidency. Now that it has happened, the Trump administration has sent mixed messages over how it would respond. It won a diplomatic victory on Saturday when the UN security council approved a new sanctions package, but the impact of the measures will depend heavily on how far China is willing to go to enforce them. While the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has said the US has no interest in pursuing regime change, the national security adviser, HR McMaster, has said that the administration is weighing all options, including a \u201cpreventative war\u201d. Lewis argued it was already too late for that. \u201cThe pre- in preventative means \u2018before\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you start the preventative war after they have the nuclear ICBMs, it\u2019s just a regular old nuclear war.\u201d The US assessment that North Korea has mastered the miniaturization of nuclear warheads was revealed in an internal Defence Intelligence Agency report dated 28 July, according to the Washington Post, which was the first to report on its existence. The report was subsequently confirmed by NBC News. \u201cThe IC [intelligence community] assesses North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles,\u201d the assessment stated, in an excerpt that was read to the Washington Post. In its defence white paper, Japan\u2019s government also said Pyongyang\u2019s weapons programme had reached a \u201cnew phase\u201d. \u201cIt is conceivable that North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme has already considerably advanced and it is possible that North Korea has already achieved the miniaturisation of nuclear weapons into warheads and has acquired nuclear warheads,\u201d the Japanese defence ministry document said. The significant advances in North Korean weapon capability coupled with the unprecedented rhetoric from a US president represent a particularly dangerous mix, analysts and former officials said. Jon Wolfsthal, Barack Obama\u2019s special assistant on arms control and nonproliferation, said: \u201cI can only imagine how a North Korean leader, after hearing Trump, will interpret something like a stray missile, or a clash between ships. In the past we were trying to tamp down the tensions. Trump is now adding fuel to the fire.\u201d Jim Walsh, a senior research associate in security studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: \u201cThe danger all along has not been that chairman Kim was going to sit up one morning in his bed and say I am going to attack the US or I\u2019m going to launch a war against South Korea. The danger has always been that we would get war on the peninsula through miscalculation, misperception \u2013 small things that grow large and end up as wars even when people don\u2019t want a war.\u201d So far neither the US nor Japanese governments have confirmed whether North Korea has built a successful re-entry vehicle, and there is disagreement among experts over what the two recent ICBM tests, on 4 and 28 July, prove. Michael Elleman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies said that a flash picked up by Japanese weather cameras suggests that the re-entry vehicle broke apart when it entered the atmosphere. \u201cThese are being called successful tests, but we don\u2019t know how successful they were. We don\u2019t know if it broke up or not, and we don\u2019t know about the accuracy of the system,\u201d Elleman said. Lewis believes the flash occurred far above the densest layer of the atmosphere and could have been caused by a reflection. \u201cThere is nothing in that video that I can\u2019t see in a successful re-entry test done by the Russians,\u201d he said. He said the streaks observed coming from the missile were \u201ca normal thing to see with a re-entry vehicle\u201d.",
