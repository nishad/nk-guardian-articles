    "content": "The US defence secretary warned North Korea that any threat to the US or its allies would be met with a \u201cmassive military response\u201d on Sunday, as the Trump administration scrambled to respond to Pyongyang\u2019s claim it has tested a powerful hydrogen bomb that can be loaded on to an intercontinental ballistic missile. \u201cWe are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea,\u201d said James Mattis, speaking outside the White House, but \u201cwe have many options to do so\u201d. He added: \u201cWe made clear that we have the ability to defend ourselves and our allies, South Korea and Japan, from any attack. And our commitment among the allies is ironclad: any threat to the United States or its territories, including Guam, or our allies will be met with a massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming.\u201d And he told Kim Jong-un to \u201ctake heed of the United Nations security council\u2019s unified voice\u201d and de-nuclearise the Korean peninsula. The United Nations security council called a meeting for Monday. Amid alarm from world leaders over North Korea\u2019s claim that it can now, for the first time, put a nuclear warhead on an ICBM, Trump had earlier upped the ante with a series of provocative statements. Asked outside church in Washington whether he planned to attack the isolated, hostile dictatorship, the US president replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He and the first lady were whisked back to the White House from St John\u2019s Episcopal church in an SUV. Shortly afterwards, Trump tweeted: \u201cI will be meeting General Kelly [John Kelly, chief of staff], General Mattis and other military leaders at the White House to discuss North Korea. Thank you.\u201d Earlier in the day, after news emerged overnight that North Korea was believed to have detonated a large hydrogen bomb in a test in the north of the country, deepening the biggest foreign policy challenge faced by his administration, Trump posted a series of tweets. \u201cNorth Korea has conducted a major nuclear test,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cTheir words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.\u201d He added: \u201cNorth Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.\u201d And he also accused South Korea of favouring a policy of \u201cappeasement\u201d, telling Seoul that \u201cwill not work\u201d because the North Koreans \u201conly understand one thing!\u201d Early on Monday, South Korea\u2019s military said its air forces and the army carried out a missile drill in response to North Korea\u2019s nuclear test, adding the drills targeted the area where the test had been carried out. The military training involved long-range air-to-surface missiles and ballistic missiles, South Korea\u2019s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement. The drill was carried out by only the South Korean military but more are being prepared with the US forces in South Korea, the statement said. Pyongyang said the test, its sixth since 2006, had been a \u201ccomplete success\u201d and involved a two-stage thermonuclear weapon of unprecedented strength. There has been no independent verification of North Korea\u2019s claims that it has achieved a key goal in its nuclear programme \u2013 the ability to miniaturise a warhead so that it can fit on a long-distance missile. The regime has earlier released footage of what it said was a hydrogen bomb that would be loaded on to a new ICBM. Pyongyang\u2019s TV announcement, which was accompanied by patriotic music and images of North Korean landscape and military hardware, said the test had been ordered by the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. The explosion caused by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake felt in Yanji, China, about six miles (10km) from North Korea\u2019s Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the north-east of the country. South Korea\u2019s meteorological administration estimated the blast yield at between 50 to 60 kilotons, or five to six times more powerful than North Korea\u2019s fifth test in September last year. Kim Young-woo, the head of South Korea\u2019s parliamentary defence committee said later that the yield was as high as 100 kilotons. One kiloton is equivalent to 1,000 tons of TNT. The previous nuclear blast in North Korea is estimated by experts to have been about 10 kilotons. Sunday\u2019s test, the first since Trump took office in January, offers further evidence that North Korea is moving perilously close to developing a nuclear warhead capable of being fitted on to an ICBM that can strike the US mainland. Since it conducted its first nuclear test just over a decade ago, the regime has strived to refine the design and reliability of its weapons, as well as increasing their yield. Hydrogen bombs are far more powerful than the atomic weapons Pyongyang is believed to have tested so far. Trump also tweeted again shortly after noon, in apparent support of a new policy initiative announced by his treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, earlier in the day, where he called for any countries that trade with North Korea to be barred from trading with the US. Mnuchin, also a member of Trump\u2019s national security council, said on Sunday that he wanted to cut off North Korea\u2019s economy because of the test. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this behavior is completely unacceptable,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cWe have already started with sanctions but I\u2019m going to draft a sanctions package that I\u2019m going to send to the president for his strong consideration, that anybody that wants to do trade or business with them [North Korea] would be prevented from doing trade or business with us. People need to cut off North Korea, economically.\u201d When asked if the US would take a much tougher stance with Chinese financial institutions and companies in that regard, Mnuchin said: \u201cWe are going to strongly consider everything at this point.\u201d He refused to comment on \u201cclassified things\u201d such as whether the test was a hydrogen bomb, not just an atomic bomb, and whether the US believed that North Korea had now miniaturized its nuclear capability to the point where it could put a nuclear warhead on an ICBM. \u201cI can only say that the intelligence community has been doing an amazing job,\u201d he said. He said he had spoken to Trump about the issue that morning, but refused to clarify what the president meant when he said North Korea only understood \u201cone thing\u201d, or comment on the prospect of military action. \u201cThe president has made it clear this is not the time for just talk, this is the time for action,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cOur objective will continue to be to de-nuclearize the peninsula \u2026 He will consider everything but we are not going to broadcast our actions. My focus right now is on additional economic sanctions. China has a lot of trade with them; there is a lot we can do to cut them off economically.\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry earlier said in a statement: \u201cThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has once again conducted a nuclear test in spite of widespread opposition from the international community. The Chinese government resolutely opposes and strongly condemns it.\u201d Before taking office, Trump declared North Korea would not be allowed to develop an ICBM capable of reaching the US mainland under his presidency. After Pyongyang carried out two successful ICBM tests in July, Trump warned it would face \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d if it made any further threats. North Korea has since threatened to fire a salvo of missiles into the seas around the US Pacific territory of Guam, and fired a ballistic missile over Japanese territory for the first time, ending US hopes that Trump\u2019s threats had cowed Pyongyang into a pause in missile tests and a possible opening for talks. Complicating matters, Trump seems to be considering asking aides to prepare for US withdrawal from a free trade agreement with South Korea, it was reported on Saturday. Mnuchin stressed that \u201cno decision has been made\u201d. Jeff Flake, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, said: \u201cI do not think that that would be good in any circumstances; it\u2019s particularly troubling right now.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s tweeted response to the nuclear test, Flake told CNN: \u201cI have good confidence in our national security team and those who are advising the president. He does not have experience in this kind of situation. I\u2019m confident that the people around the president are giving him good advice and he will take it - I sure hope he does.\u201d The Republican senator added: \u201cI\u2019ve had my concerns about statements from the president about Nato and foreign policy. We want someone who is measured and sober and consistent. Allies want to have that and our enemies need to have that.\u201d Flake said that Trump\u2019s notorious threat last month to meet North Korean aggression with \u201cfire and fury\u201d had not been not advisable. \u201cWe have not slowed the advance of their nuclear program, but harsh rhetoric does not either,\u201d he said. \u201cJust about nothing we have done so far has slowed it down. It becomes a cliche to say there are no good options here, but there really are not. For those who believe we can simply strike and knock out their capability, they do not understand the situation there. But all options need to be on the table.\u201d",
