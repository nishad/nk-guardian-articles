    "content": "It took nearly two weeks, but North Korea has finally released its official opinion on Brexit \u2013 and it\u2019s all America\u2019s fault. An editorial published in the state newspaper Rodong Sinmun concluded that 52% of British voters opted to leave the European Union because it had lost its \u201coriginal spirit\u201d. The article, titled \u201cEuropean Union confused\u201d, argued the EU was meant to counterbalance the \u201cUS\u2019s imperialist monolithic system\u201d but had lost its way, and had started supporting America in its \u201creckless\u201d foreign policy pursuits instead. This in turn has led to \u201cturmoil of destruction, blood, civil-war and anarchistic chaos\u201d in the Middle East and \u201cendless refugees\u201d heading to Europe, according to extracts translated by NK News. The secretive state is well known for its verbose attacks on its enemies, but North Korea watchers will not be surprised that once again the blame falls at Washington\u2019s door. Here\u2019s a quick refresher on how they\u2019ve reacted to other major news events, from terror attacks to climate change. US police brutality The US is a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and a \u201cglobal laughing stock\u201d, wrote the state news agency KCNA after the police shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown led to riots in the city of Ferguson in 2014. Making the most of Schadenfreude, North Korea went on to brand the US a \u201chuman rights graveyard\u201d, calling on Washington to sort out its problems at home before condemning others. Just six months earlier, the UN had accused North Korea of human rights abuses akin to that of Nazi Germany. The Iraq War As Lord Chilcot releases his long awaited inquiry into the Iraq war, which concludes that the UK pushed \u201cfor military action when peaceful alternatives had not been exhausted\u201d, it is worth looking back at how North Korea reacted. According to NK News, the 2003 invasion spooked the then leader Kim Jong-il, who was rushed to an underground compound by his \u201celite security team\u201d. The implication was \u201csobering\u201d for the DPRK \u2013 if the US would go after regime change in Iraq, could North Korea be next? Kim\u2019s response? Keep developing the nuclear weapons programme. 9/11 North Korea has a mixed record when it comes to responding to terror attacks on US soil. They issued condolences when the New York\u2019s twin towers were hit by two planes on 11 September 2001 killing nearly 3,000 people, yet earlier this year they released a chilling article warning that a North Korean nuclear attack on US soil could cause even more damage. \u201cA final war will wipe the country from history, leaving no time [for] regret,\u201d the article promised, although North Korea expert Daniel Pinkston told NK News that these threats were probably intended for a domestic audiences as a way to encourage them to support government propaganda. Climate change At other times North Korea has been an unlikely champion on global issues. Despite denouncing the United Nations report on their human rights record, the state has been happy to collaborate with the agency on climate change, endorsing a global framework. But why? According to The Conversation, it is within the state\u2019s interests: not only is the country vulnerable to extreme weather, but the fallout could end up undermining state control.",
