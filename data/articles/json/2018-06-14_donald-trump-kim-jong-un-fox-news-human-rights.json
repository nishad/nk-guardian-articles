    "content": "Donald Trump has dismissed concerns about the widely condemned human rights record of the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, praising him as a \u201ctough guy\u201d, a \u201csmart guy\u201d and a \u201cgreat negotiator\u201d. In an interview with Bret Baier of Fox News as he was leaving Singapore following the denuclearization summit with the North Korean leader, Trump declined to condemn the record of his interlocutor. International bodies have accused Kim of crimes against humanity including assassinations of political rivals, public executions and holding captive tens of thousands of political prisoners. Speaking in a wood-paneled office aboard Air Force One, Baier put it to the US president that Kim was \u201ca killer. He\u2019s executing people.\u201d Trump replied by praising Kim as a \u201ctough guy. Hey, when you take over a country, tough country, with tough people, and you take it over from your father, I don\u2019t care who you are, what you are, how much of an advantage you have \u2013 if you can do that at 27 years old, that\u2019s one in 10,000 could do that.\u201d Trump went on: \u201cSo he\u2019s a very smart guy, he\u2019s a great negotiator and I think we understand each other.\u201d Baier, sounding taken aback by the president\u2019s flippant response, pressed Trump on the issue: \u201cBut he\u2019s still done some really bad things.\u201d To which Trump said: \u201cYeah, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done.\u201d Trump\u2019s failure to condemn one of the worst human rights records on the world stage is certain to inflame criticism that is already being leveled at him from both Democrats and Republicans in the wake of the summit. The presidential center of the former Republican president George W Bush has been tweeting about North Korea\u2019s abuses, giving a clear indication of how he views the matter. Other public figures have been more directly critical. A Democratic senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said of the outcome of the Singapore summit: \u201cKim\u2019s gulags, public executions, planned starvation, are legitimized on the world stage \u2026 What the hell?\u201d The issue of human rights was notably absent from the joint statement signed by Trump and Kim at their five-hour summit on Tuesday. Nor has there been any mention of human rights in the early discussions about follow-up meetings between the Trump administration and the North Korean regime. Among the outrages that could be put on the agenda are the up to 120,000 political prisoners that are thought to be held in four political prison camps in North Korea. A UN inquiry accused the regime of \u201csystematic, widespread and gross human rights violations\u201d rising frequently to the level of crimes against humanity. The UN added: \u201cThese are not mere excesses of the state; they are essential components of a political system that has moved far from the ideals on which it claims to be founded. The gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world.\u201d North Korea under Kim amounted, the UN concluded, to a totalitarian regime that \u201cseeks to dominate every aspect of its citizens\u2019 lives and terrorizes them from within\u201d.",
