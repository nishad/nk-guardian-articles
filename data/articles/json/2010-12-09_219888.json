There is a peaceful nuclear component intended to address Burma's chronic lack of electrical power generation. When Chan cited reports of a Burma-Russia agreement for development of a peaceful nuclear reactor, XXXXXXXXXXXX responded that the agreement with Russia is currently just for \"software, training.\" The DPRK agreement is for \"hardware.\" XXXXXXXXXXXX confirmed reports Burma's Army Chief of Staff (third highest ranking) General Thura Shwe Mann visited the DPRK last November. Asked why Thura Shwe Mann, XXXXXXXXXXXX responded, \"Because he is in charge of all military activities.\" XXXXXXXXXXXX reportedly seemed surprised that the West might be concerned by a Burma-DPRK \"peaceful\" nuclear relationship.
