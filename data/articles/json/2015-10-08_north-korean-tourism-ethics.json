    "content": "Asking a person who risked their life to escape from North Korea why foreigners would pay to go on holiday there has a touch of the surreal. Ji Min-kang, who fled the country after his grandfather, a government minister, was imprisoned and his family placed under surveillance, struggles to understand it. \u201cOutsiders can\u2019t communicate with the citizens and the guides control all that they see,\u201d says Ji. \u201cYou cannot see the real North Korea as a tourist.\u201d Yet despite tight restrictions and widespread human rights abuses, the number of people visiting North Korea is booming. In 2005 \u2013 around the time Ji defected with his sister and mother \u2013 the number of western tourists was in the hundreds. Now 5,000 visit every year, say Koryo Tours, the biggest operator taking tourists to the isolated communist dictatorship. That number is still dwarfed by Chinese tourists, estimated to be 100,000 annually. And the North Korean government wants more. In recent years it has opened new attractions such as the five-star Masikryong ski resort, the \u201ctourist city\u201d of Wonsan, and is training future tour guides at Pyongyang tourism college. In June, they said by 2020 they want two million foreigners to be visiting annually. A force for good? The tour companies taking visitors in encourage the view that tourism is a positive thing, but the extent to which it helps remains difficult to unpick, with many remaining sceptical. \u201cIf tourism were opening North Korea [up], over the 15-year span of this industry we ought to have seen some evolution in the restrictions and permissible exposure of foreigners to North Korean society,\u201d says Joshua Stanton, founder of the OneFreeKorea blog. \u201c[But] we haven\u2019t.\u201d \u201cKim Jong-un has redoubled his efforts to isolate the majority of his people ... cracking down on cross-border cell phones, smuggling, and refugee flows,\u201d he adds. This is also the attitude held by the European Alliance for Human Rights in North Korea \u2013 who have supported defectors such as Ji. They argue that the tourism industry serves only \u201cto fund and legitimise the regime\u201d. As destinations go, North Korea is unique. State guides will accompany you throughout and there is no deviation from the government-approved itinerary. Trips aren\u2019t cheap either \u2013 four nights can cost around \u00a31,000 excluding flights \u2013 and it is a profitable enterprise for all involved. But those working in the industry argue that the money trickling through to the government is small \u2013 and if they were to cease operations tomorrow the impact on the regime would be negligible. \u2018Tourism helped the citizens of the USSR\u2019 Andrei Lankov, a specialist in Korean studies who attended Pyongyang\u2019s Kim Il-sung University in the 1980s but has since been blacklisted, supports the view that tourism can subtly undermine the authoritarian government. He draws from his own experience growing up in a working class family in the Soviet Union and recalls seeing tourists from Finland, who would visit the USSR for the cheap alcohol. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk to them, but everybody saw how they dressed and how they behaved and nobody could view them as poor victims of capitalist exploitation,\u201d he says. \u201cThey showed a very high level of living and individual freedom. Not a single person had any doubt that people in western countries lived [a] better [life] than us.\u201d Lankov believes that a revolution in North Korea cannot be forced. He\u2019s a proponent of slow evolution, in which tourism can play a \u201cminor and marginal\u201d role. But Ji places less emphasis on the tourist connection. It\u2019s easier than ever, he says, for North Koreans to get information from the outside from other means \u2013 radio transmissions from China and South Korea are the prime example. Hyeonseo Lee, a North Korean activist and author of The Girl With Seven Names, the story of her escape in 1997, is equally cynical. North Koreans can get in serious trouble for trying to talk to a foreigner about any substantive issues, so this is \u201chardly constructive engagement\u201d, she says. Besides, most North Koreans who tourists meet in Pyongyang are part of the elite, with little incentive to resist. \u201cTourists are used as propaganda,\u201d says Hyeonseo. \u201cThey are required to bow to the large statue of our first dictator, Kim Il-sung\u201d,and these images are used by \u201cpropagandists to show North Koreans that foreigners come from all over the world to pay homage to the Dear Leader.\u201d She adds: \u201cThis is an effective brainwashing technique for the North Korean people, who think that if foreigners are making a pilgrimage to respect the leader ... North Korea\u2019s supremacy must be true.\u201d Hyeonseo is also critical of the tour companies. They have full access to information about the injustices of the regime yet still take people there, she says, \u201cand profit in the process.\u201d One of the first travel companies to specialise in trips to North Korea is Koryo Tours, founded in 1993, who take around 40% of the western visitors to the country. Vicky Mohieddeen, creative projects manager for Koryo Tours, says that many more North Koreans are now employed as guides, coach drivers, restaurant workers and other jobs catering to the influx of tourists. \u201cThey enjoy certain benefits because they work in the tourism industry,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are healthy and enjoy the wages and benefits of working as a tour guide; they get to meet foreign people, practice foreign languages and they get a glimpse of the outside world.\u201d Gareth Johnson, founder of Young Pioneer Tours, believes the gentle requests from travel companies to take visitors to new locations has played a \u201chuge role\u201d in encouraging the North Korean government to relax. \u201cIf you go back eight years ago to when I started, Americans weren\u2019t allowed in the country at all,\u201d he says. \u201cIf something opened \u2013 like the swimming pools, or the aquarium \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t be allowed to go or you\u2019d have to seek permission. Now, generally speaking if something opens you can.\u201d Educational Visitors are also left with conflicted feelings. Ludovica Picone travelled to North Korea with Young Pioneer Tours in 2012. She describes the trip as a \u201cpropaganda tour de force\u201d, but believes tourism can be educational. It\u2019s not just about the North Koreans, but western tourists also \u201cgetting a better understanding the country and its ideology,\u201d she says. \u201cIt becomes very evident that the magnitude of the North Korean threat has been amplified by the media.\u201d Guardian journalist Peter Walker visited the country in 2003. \u201cMy feelings are mixed,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the one hand you\u2019re giving money to a regime which the UN has said bears moral equivalence to the Nazis. Against that, you\u2019re arguably helping keep some North Koreans a bit in touch with the outside world.\u201d Tourists should ask themselves if they actually want to go, he says, adding \u201cit\u2019s the most depressing place I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d had a performance by kids from a sort of state theatre school. I assumed the ones we met were about six or seven. It turned out they were 10 or older. Even as kids of the elite they\u2019d been stunted by the famine\u201d \u2013 which ravaged the country in the 1990s. In terms of helping the outside world understand North Korea better, the people working for the tour companies have played a significant role as a news source, providing insights and tip-offs from within a country that has tight restrictions on journalists. Though it ultimately serves to promote the tour operators, some of their work has been particularly impressive. Koryo Tours helped produce award-winning documentary the Game of Their Lives, about surviving members of North Korean 1966 World Cup team, who were adopted by football fans from Middlesbrough. \u201cSuch links are arguably vital in a discourse dominated by talk of war,\u201d says Walker. #LivefromNorthKorea Meanwhile Instagram posts tagged #livefromNorthKorea help, to some degree, expand our conception of life inside the state. \u201cThose pictures aren\u2019t the full story,\u201d says Mohieddeen who set up the hashtag and has faced criticism in the past for the photos. \u201cIt\u2019s not everything that exists in NK but it\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing and experiencing, which is more than most.\u201d But for Hyeonseo, it\u2019s disheartening to hear tourists claim that the real North Korea is so much better than the one they\u2019ve read about. For tourism to really become a force for good, tourists need to be asking critical questions of the regime, but \u201cunfortunately, the regime will never allow this\u201d, says Hyeonseo. \u201cBecause they know the danger of allowing free thought and expression.\u201d",
